    "# Week 5 - Sampling & Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this week, we have assumed that the corpus you have used for analysis assignments represented a *meaningful* assemblage of texts from which reasonable inferences could be drawn about the social game, social world and social actors that produced it. This week, we ask you to articulate what your sample represents in context of your final project, and draw upon methods we have developed over the last three weeks to draw reasonable and representative samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we also pivot from our recent work on unsupervized machine learning approaches to explore how we can get *human* readings of content at scale. We want to gather and utilize human responses for several reasons. First, we may want to use crowdsourced human scores as the primary method of coding, extracting or organizing content (as it was in the two of the assigned readings). Second, we may want to validate or tune a computational algorithm we may have developed in terms of how it is associated with human meanings or experience. Finally, we may want to use human coding on a sample of data as the basis for training a model or algorithm to then extrapolate *human-like* annotations to the entire population. Here intelligent sampling is critical to maximize effective maching training. \n",

    "Load Rzhetsky et al (2009)'s sample dataset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/enthought/uchicago-pyanno/tree/master/data). This data is the result of a content analytic / content extraction study in which Andrey Rzhetsky and colleagues from the National Library of Medicine, published [here](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000391) in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/), gave eight annotators 10,000 sentence chunks from biomedical text in biomedical abstracts and articles, then asked them, in a loop design schematically illustrated below that provided 3 independent codings for each document. The sampling strategy pursued diversity by drawing from PubMed abstracts (1000) and full-text articles (9000: 20% from abstracts, 10% from introductions, 20% from methods, 25% from results, and 25% from discussions.) The dataset extract here involves respondents codes for sentences in terms of their *Evidence*: {0, 1, 2, 3, -1} where 0 is the complete lack of evidence, 3 is direct evidence present within the sentence, and -1 is didn't respond. (They also crowdsourced and analyzed *polarity*, *certainty*, and *number*). For example, consider the following two abutting sentence chunks: *\"Because null mutations in toxR and toxT abolish CT and TcpA expression in the El Tor biotype and also attenuate virulence...\"* [i.e., average certainty = 0], *\"...it is likely that the ToxR regulon has functional similarities between the two biotypes despite the clear differences in the inducing parameters observed in vitro\"* [i.e., average certainty = 1].\"\n",

    "However, what if some coders are better than others. The prior measures all rely on the assumption that all coders are equally good. What if some are worse than others? Now we use Rzhetsky et al (2009) and Dawid & Skene's models to make inference about true label classes by downweighting bad or deviant coders. Pyanno provides three relevant models: ModelA, ModelB, and ModelBt. Model A can only be currently run on a balanced 8-coder design, but assesses accuracy purely based on agreement. Model B with $\\theta$s models the relationship between each coder and code. Model B is the Dawid & Skene model from the reading. The following image schematically suggests the relationship between the models. <img src=\"../data/models.png\">"
