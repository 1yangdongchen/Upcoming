When dealing only with latin letters, arabic numerals and the other symbols on America keyboards you usually do not have to worry about encodings as the ones used today are backwards compatible with [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) which gives the binary representation of 128 characters.\n",

To solve this there is [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) which gives numbers to symbols, e.g. 041 is `'A'` and 03A3 is `'Σ'` (number starting with 0 indicates they are hexadecimal), often non-ASCII characters are called Unicode characters. Unfortunately there are many ways used to map combinations of bits to Unicode symbols. The ones you are likely to encounter are called by Python _utf-8_, _utf-16_ and _latin-1_. _utf-8_ is the standard for Linux and Mac OS while both _utf-16_ and _latin-1_ are used by windows. If you use the wrong encoding characters can appear wrong, sometimes change in number or Python could raise an exception. Lets see what happens when we open the file we just created with different encodings."
