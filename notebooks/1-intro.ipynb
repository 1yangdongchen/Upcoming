Unfortunately there are many ways used to map combinations of bits to Unicode symbols. The ones you are likely to encounter are called by Python _utf-8_, _utf-16_ and _latin-1_. _utf-8_ is the standard for Linux and Mac OS while both _utf-16_ and _latin-1_ are used by windows.

The random characters are not though caused by our encoding being wrong they are cause by there not being an encoding for those parts at all. PDFs are nominally binary files, meaning there are sections of binary that are specific to pdf and nothing else so you need something that knows about pdf to read them. To do that we will be using [`PyPDF2`](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) which is a PDF processing library for Python 3.\n",

      "Ethics of “Taste, Ties, and Time”\n",
      "\tIn 2008, sociologist Kevin Lewis and colleagues conduced a research project, entitled “Taste, Ties, and Time (3T),” to examine how race and cultural tastes could affect people’s social relationships. Researchers collected 1,640 college students’ Facebook profiles from Facebook.com and combined these data with the students’ school records, creating a new social network dataset. Through subsequent quantitative analyses of the dataset researchers concluded that gender, race, and socioeconomic status all influenced how these students behaved in social networks. In addition, the results showed that students’ Facebook friendships were correlated with their cultural preferences. Lewis and colleagues’ findings were published in the journal Social Networks and opened up a new branch in social science research. Despite its scientific potential, the project attracted critics from the public as well as the scientific community. The researchers were accused of violating research ethics, such that they scraped data without gaining informed consent and invading the students’ personal privacy by releasing the dataset to other researchers (Zimmer, 2010). Consequently, the students in the 3T project were identified, resulting a withdrawal of the dataset (Salganik, in open review). In this essay, I evaluate how the 3T project adheres to Salganik's four principles of ethical research, which are Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest.\n",
      "\tFirst of all, the 3T project violates the first principle, Respect for Persons, which is to ensure research participants’ autonomy (Salganik, in open review). According to the principle of Respect for Persons, people are entitled to be on their own free will to decide whether or not to participate in a given study. Additionally, special population such as children and prisoners are required to be treated with additional cautions. Researchers implement Respect for Persons by obtaining participants’ informed consent, a comprehensive written document allowing participants to be aware of the study’s procedures and potential risks. In the 3T project, researchers used students’ Facebook profiles data without the students’ awareness, not to mention obtaining informed consent. Such conduct clearly disobeyed the Respect for Persons principle. Although Lewis and colleagues claimed that when people registered for a Facebook account they agreed to allow Facebook to use their online data for research purposes by checking the term of use, it is still the researchers’ responsibility to explicitly give the students an opportunity to choose if they wanted their data to be included. After all, not many people carefully read all the items in term of use. Admittedly, violating the principle of Respect for Persons does not doom a study to a forbidden fate, but rather it alerts the researchers that their study needs amendments for being a more ethical one. \n"
