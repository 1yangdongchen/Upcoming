VOINOVICH SECURES ASSISTANCE FOR STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS, EMPLOYERS IN SENATE-PASSED FORECLOSURE BILL
  The U.S. Senate today passed the bipartisan legislative plan to help ease the housing crisis by a vote of 84 to 12. U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) secured immediate relief and assistance for struggling Ohio homeowners and employers in the bill. 
   The Sen. Voinovich-authored provisions include: 
   * Simplifying mortgage documents to ensure Ohioans understand clearly the terms of their mortgage before signing them;
   * Tackling reform of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which could allow Americans facing foreclosure or resetting interest rates to refinance without the usual burdens associated with a FHA loan by increasing and simplifying FHA's loan limits; 
   * Providing funding for financial counseling programs; 
   * Increasing Community Development Block Grant funding targeted towards revitalizing residential areas; and 
   * Allowing companies in a loss position to use accumulated AMT and R&D credits early to make new investments that will create jobs in lieu of the bonus depreciation provision included in the recently-enacted stimulus bill. 
   Sen. Voinovich originally introduced the first four provisions in previous legislation and fought for them with committee leadership. The employer tax credits provision was introduced as an amendment to the compromise bill by Sen. Voinovich and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and successfully amended to the overall bill by a vote of 76-2 last week.
   ""Americans have looked to Congress to take real action to help protect homeowners,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This bipartisan compromise is a solid step in the right direction and includes the types of immediate relief and assistance struggling homeowners have been waiting for.""
    Sen. Voinovich is particularly pleased about the inclusion of his employer tax credits provision. Companies in a loss position cannot take advantage of the bonus depreciation provision included in the recently-enacted stimulus bill because they do not have any taxable income against which to take the deductions. Ironically, these are the companies who are struggling the most and who are in greatest need of relief. This will create jobs and, in turn, help people pay their mortgages. 
   ""A good-paying job is the first step to ensure Americans can achieve the dream of homeownership and sustain that dream throughout their lives,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This amendment is crucial because Ohio is experiencing a foreclosure crisis that has nothing to do with speculators. Ohio has a foreclosure crisis despite the fact that house prices never increased in the state. Ohio families have been losing their homes because Ohio manufacturing workers have been losing their jobs.""
   Sen. Voinovich has authored three pieces of legislation focused on helping to ease the current crisis and providing additional tools for neighborhoods to revitalize and restore abandoned properties. 
   Sen. Voinovich originally proposed improved disclosure for mortgage documents and additional resources for rehabilitating foreclosed properties and for housing counseling in his Protecting American Homeowners Act of 2008, which was introduced last week. The reform of FHA was originally proposed by Sen. Voinovich in his FHA Modernization Act, which has been passed by both chambers. The differences between the House and Senate FHA reform bills are currently being worked out in conference. 
   Additionally, Sen. Voinovich's Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act was passed by the Senate and the House and has been signed into law by the president. Sen. Voinovich was moved to draft this bill after hearing stories about how homeowners were working out deals with their lenders, and the lenders were forgiving part of the mortgages to make payments more affordable. He was then shocked to learn the IRS was taxing that loan forgiveness as income. 
   This additional tax liability actually penalizes those who are trying to work out their financial problems in a responsible manner. Altering this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided. So far, this is the only bill to become law that directly attempts to ease the foreclosure crisis. Sen. Voinovich is working on extending it for two additional years.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES STRENGTHENED BEACH PROTECTION ACT
  Today, U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) - Co-Chairman of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force - along with U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), introduced a bill reauthorizing the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act, the Beach Protection Act of 2008. 
   This legislation increases grants to states, including Great Lakes states like Ohio, for the development and implementation of programs focused on remediating contamination sources - something that is currently not covered under the BEACH Act. This bill also requires stronger beach water quality testing and public notification standards so beachgoers are better informed about the safety of their beaches.
   ""The Great Lakes are our nation's north coast and millions of Americans enjoy their beaches every year,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This bill is a vital piece of a comprehensive strategy that is absolutely necessary to save one of our nation's greatest natural resources. It will help our beaches remain healthy and safe and will protect them from the detrimental effects of pollution and sewage contamination after flooding or heavy rainfall. This is good not only for our environment but for our economy.""
   The reintroduction is a result of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study requested by Sen. Voinovich on the effect of the BEACH Act on the Great Lakes states. The GAO report found that:
   * The Great Lakes states are receiving an inequitable amount of grant funding due to length of beach season;
   * The law should provide more flexibility to states to use BEACH Act grants to investigate and remediate contamination sources; and
   * That Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should distribute grant funds to reflect state's monitoring needs.
   Traditionally, the BEACH Act has only allowed grants for beach monitoring and public notification programs. The frequency of water quality monitoring has increased at Great Lakes beaches since the passage of the BEACH Act, helping states and localities identify the scope of contamination. However, in most cases, the underlying causes of contamination remain unknown and unaddressed because state and local officials state that they do not have the funds to investigate the source of the contamination or take actions to mitigate the problem. EPA has not allowed BEACH Act grants to be used for these purposes.
   Under the reintroduced BEACH Act, the EPA is required to work with states to ensure they used the latest science to sample and test beach waters to protect the public's health. The law also helps states set up comprehensive monitoring and notification programs in order to provide up-to-date information on the condition of all public beaches.
   Additionally, the legislation doubles the authorized grant funding to states from $30 million to $60 million annually through 2012. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee - of which Sen. Voinovich is a member - will have oversight over the bill.

VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday, January 10, released the following statement regarding the new direction in Iraq and the call for a surge in troops. Sen. George Voinovich met with President Bush in the White House on Friday to discuss the current situation. Also in attendance were Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rice, National Security Advisor Hadley, Gen. Peter Pace and top White House officials. He also attended a three-hour classified intelligence briefing yesterday. Sen. George Voinovich's statement follows: 
  ""At this point I am skeptical that a surge in troops alone will bring an end to sectarian violence and the insurgency that is fomenting instability in Iraq. The generals who have served there do not believe additional troops alone will help. And my faith in Prime Minister al-Maliki's political will to make the hard choices necessary to bring about a political solution is fragile at best. What we need first is a political solution between Sunni Arabs and Shia militias that are adding to the violence.
  ""Over the next month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, will hold three hearings a week on Iraq. During that time I hope to receive from the administration the level of detail necessary to make a decision of this magnitude. And I want real evidence that a potential surge in troops will do more good than harm and will not exacerbate the existing violence in Iraq. This move may have enormous national security implications for our nation. I want answers to many critical questions and to hear straight from the generals about why this would be in the best interest of the United States."".

  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""deficit hawk,"" today co-sponsored the Tax Code Termination Act - legislation that would repeal the U.S. Tax Code by 2010 and force Congress to reauthorize it or replace it with a new system that's fair and easy to understand.  
  ""Washington has become too accustomed to its current culture - a culture that's destroying our competitiveness in the global marketplace,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Drastic measures are needed if we want to create better jobs and a higher quality of life for our kids and grandkids.""

   The commission would also be required to report on the potential impact of any new tax system on the U.S. economy and on the government's ability to collect revenue. And the bill will create a National Commission on Tax Reform within the legislative branch, consisting of 19 members. Four of the members will be required to come from businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The commission will be appointed by the president, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House and the House Minority Leader.
  ""Congress needs a serious overhaul of its tax code if we're going to get this country back on the right track,"" Sen. Voinovich said.

  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced that Adams County will receive $355,000 from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The funds will go toward the construction of an access road for the Adams County Hospital in the Village of Seaman. 
   ""I have worked hard to help this region meet its economic needs,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The construction of this road and the new county hospital will improve quality of life and further bolster the region's healthcare capabilities.""  
   The ARC funds will be used for engineering services, site work and construction for approximately 2,500 feet - almost half a mile - of a two-lane access road to serve the new hospital which is relocating to a new, 10-acre campus in the village. The new road will provide vital access to the hospital and support the retention of over 250 jobs in the area as well as create 28 new jobs by the third year of the new hospital's operation, according to the Commission. In addition, the project will ensure $22.5 million in capital investment for the hospital. 
   In addition to the ARC funds, the Village of Seaman will contribute $180,000 to the project, with estimated total project costs of $535,000. 
   The U.S. Senate last month passed by unanimous consent S. 2832 - vital legislation to reauthorize the ARC at $510.9 million over five years. Sen. Voinovich, a member of the EPW Committee, introduced the bill in May. 
   In April, Sen. Voinovich held a field hearing in Marietta, Ohio, to hear testimony on the impact of the last reauthorization of the ARC and to examine how ARC has made a difference in people's lives. After the hearing, he spent two days traveling around Appalachian Ohio and was extremely impressed with the wonderful strides being made in the region as a result of ARC investments in technology, workforce training, and economic development. 
   ARC plays a key role in fostering economic development and improving quality of life for the 23 million people who live and work in Appalachia. The proposed legislation creates the designation of economically ""at risk"" counties and provides an appropriate federal matching rate for ARC-funded projects in those counties. Since ARC's inception, the region's poverty rate has been cut in half (from 31 percent to 13 percent), the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds, and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent. 
   Key elements of the legislation: 
   * Renews the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years (2007 - 2011). The agency's current authorization expires September 30, 2006. The proposed legislation is the same length as the bipartisan authorization Congress approved in 2002. 
   * Authorizes the Commission for five years at the following levels: 
   2007: $95.2 million 
   2008: $98.6 million 
   2009: $102 million 
   2010: $105.7 million 
   2011: $109.4 million 
   * The bill directs the Commission annually to designate those counties that are ""at risk"" of becoming economically distressed. These counties have fragile economies that are just on the cusp of meeting the criteria for being designated as distressed. The Commission itself recently adopted this targeting classification. The legislation would codify the Commission's existing practice. 
   * Permits ARC to fund projects in the ""at risk"" counties at up to 70 percent of the cost of the project. Under current law, these projects may only be funded at 50 percent (the match rate for most ARC counties), while projects in designated distressed counties can be funded at 80 percent of the project costs. This provision reflects the special needs of ""at risk"" counties. 
   * Maintains the requirement that at least 50 percent of the Commission's grant dollars go for projects or activities benefiting distressed counties and areas. This provision was added in ARC's 2002 reauthorization. The Commission currently satisfies this requirement, and no change is proposed. 
   * Continues all existing programmatic authorities, including the special program in telecommunications and technology. The bill proposes no changes in ARC's general programs, nor does it create any new authorities because of the strong history of accomplishment. 
   During his first term in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich authored the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 (S. 1206), which was signed by the president on March 12, 2002. The bill reauthorized the economic development efforts of the Appalachian Regional Commission, providing $446 million over five years for these efforts, and enacted a new, Voinovich-created technology initiative to help improve the region's telecommunication infrastructure and help businesses and residents take better advantage of e-commerce opportunities.

VOINOVICH COMMENTS ON UNFUNDED MANDATES/WATER INFRASTRUCTURE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today sent a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson urging the EPA to provide more funding and flexibility for cities in complying with EPA's mandates on water and sewer infrastructure. While cities are forced to comply with federal regulations or face federal fines, the funding is nearly nonexistent - making these regulations unfunded mandates.
  The proposed 2009 budget cuts funding to the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund to $555 million - the lowest funding level in the program's history. Sen. Voinovich would like to increase the budget to $1.35 billion to ensure Washington isn't forcing cities into bankruptcy. The cost for Ohio's cities is estimated to be around $12 billion. That's more than 10 times what the entire nation received in funding to help comply with these mandates. These costs - which are often larger than a small city's entire yearly budget - are incurred by cities and passed along to taxpayers. 
  Please see below for the letter:
  February 11, 2008
  The Honorable Stephen Johnson
  Administrator
  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
  Ariel Rios Building
  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20460
  Dear Administrator Johnson:
  I write today out of concern and frustration that we are facing an environmental and public health crisis in this country when it comes to water infrastructure. This is an issue that has been a long-standing concern of mine, and one that frankly, I feel is not being adequately prioritized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
  I have been interested in this subject for over 20 years. While mayor of the city of Cleveland, I experienced firsthand the difficulties in finding funding for water infrastructure. As governor, I successfully worked with Congress to rewrite the Safe Drinking Water Act that gave state and local governments more power in protecting their water supply and continually fought for legislation to further support and improve the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. As Senator, I have continually supported legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and to increase funding for this important program. 
  Last September, I attended an Environment and Public Works Subcommittee hearing called ""Meeting America's Wastewater Infrastructure Needs in the 21st Century."" At the hearing, I stressed my concern about the lack of funding for water and wastewater infrastructure projects to fulfill mandates from EPA. Many communities in Ohio and across the nation do not have the fiscal capacity or the federal aid needed to upgrade their water and wastewater systems as mandated by EPA. 
  New reports have shed additionally light on the crisis. As you know, the recently released Clean Watersheds Needs Survey 2004 estimates the national needs for the wastewater treatment and collection at $193.5 billion. Ohio ranks as having one of the largest wastewater treatment collection needs at $11.7 billion. Only New York, Illinois and California have greater needs. For example, representatives of a sewer district in Northeast Ohio informed me that they will have to impose a rate increase of at least 12 percent each year for the next 30 years to finance the $80 to 120 million annual capital program mandated by EPA. This rate increase is on top of the $2.1 billion the sewer district has already spent to meet Clean Water Act requirements. 
  Combined sewer overflow (CSO) also continues to be a problem. Combined sewer systems serve roughly 772 communities and roughly 40 million people nationwide. During heavy rainfall, CSO discharges can lead to serious water pollution problems. Your agency has identified almost $6.3 billion of improvements as necessary to address CSO problems in over 100 communities throughout Ohio. City officials in Akron, Ohio have proposed spending $426 million over 30 years to fix their city's CSO problems. Here again, EPA is not stepping up to the plate to assist a community substantially costs needed to mitigate the negative environmental and health effects brought about by an inadequate wastewater system. I must tell you that most communities consider this to be an unfunded mandate. Many of my communities are facing significant economic woes with major employers threatening to leave. Their ratepayers cannot afford these increases. 
  If the federal government is going to impose costly mandates on struggling state and local governments, then it should provide funding for compliance with those mandates. One of the most effective and popular sources of funding for wastewater collection and treatment projects is the Clean Water SRF Program. Billions of dollars have been distributed though the program to upgrade the nation's aging wastewater infrastructure. That is why I am continually disappointed that EPA's budgets propose severe spending cuts for the program.
  Time and again I have expressed my frustrations and urged EPA to provide the leadership necessary to resolve this problem. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many of my constituents, that has yet to happen. I strongly believe that if EPA is not able to provide the necessary assistance to communities struggling to comply with federal mandates, some flexibility must be given to communities that are grappling to find the financial capacity to get the job done. 
  All parties involved need to come together to find a solution to this crisis. I would like to receive your suggestions on how relief could be provided to communities struggling to comply with various EPA mandates. 
  I look forward to working with you and my colleagues to address the unmet water and wastewater infrastructure needs in this country. Together, I believe we can ensure that our towns and communities have the funding and flexibility needed to upgrade our aging infrastructure without unnecessarily burdening already strained local economies. 
  Sincerely,
  George V. Voinovich
  United States Senator

Voinovich, along with 24 other members of Congress in 2002, strongly supported the designation to the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   ""This designation will send a clear message to the nation that the Great Lakes region is committed to protecting the Lakes from all invasive species, including silver carp,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""We have worked hard to revitalize the Lakes and these foreign species are a serious threat to the native fish population, the ecosystem and the fishing and boating community. We need to do everything in our power to help guard against them."" 
   Silver carp were introduced to the United States in the 1970s as a management tool for sewage lagoons and fishery production ponds. The carp made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River more than 10 years ago. Silver carp are difficult to handle and transport because of their tendency to jump - growing up to three feet long and 60 pounds in weight, silver carp have leaped into moving boats injuring people and damaging equipment. 
   Biologists worry that silver carp could spread through large rivers and lakes in the U.S. and compete with native species for food and habitat, having both ecological and economic impacts and threatening, for example, the multimillion-dollar Great Lakes fishery. 
   Since the beginning of his political career, Sen. Voinovich has committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the Great Lakes. Forty years ago, when he was elected to the Ohio State Legislature, he waged what he refers to as the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lakes. Through his efforts in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich was influential in providing important funding for the construction of preventive electric barriers located on the Illinois River and in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES BILL AIMED AT JOB DEVELOPMENT, KEEPING AMERICA COMPETITIVE
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today introduced legislation aimed at creating new jobs by making it easier for states to implement regional workforce and economic development programs that meet the needs of the workers and employers. The Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development Act of 2008, or the WIRED Act, will assist states in attracting and retaining businesses and jobs by helping to ensure that a state can leverage federal workforce dollars towards the development of a well-trained workforce.
   ""My legislation works to ensure that America's workforce includes the right people with the right skills in the right place at the right time,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Global competition is often seen as a national challenge, but the regional level is where solutions must be developed to meet that challenge. Local economies are where companies, workers, educators, researchers, entrepreneurs, philanthropies and governments come together to create competitive advantages and where new ideas and knowledge are transformed into advanced, high-quality products and services."" 
   Sen. Voinovich's bill will allow regions to effectively align education, workforce and economic development systems toward meeting regional economic needs. It provides a framework through which regions can:
   * Identify assets, opportunities and risks;
   * Establish regional economic goals; and 
   * Develop workforce and economic development strategies that will help achieve those goals.
   The WIRED Act amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), which was passed by Congress to authorize service and training for youths, adults and laid-off or dislocated workers to give states and regions greater flexibility in their use of federal workforce development dollars. It also allows states to focus on developing more regional and demand-driven workforce programs and increases the ability for economic and workforce development funds to be used to leverage scarce federal dollars. Currently, WIA program funds cannot easily be used across program areas. As a result, the existing workforce training system is not fully meeting workers and employers' needs.
   Despite Ohio's relatively high unemployment rate (5.5 percent compared to the national average of 4.9 percent in January 2008) and many economic challenges, Ohio will return roughly $20 million in unspent WIA dollars from prior years as part of a federal rescission of these funds. This is happening, in part, because reallocating these funds to address other workforce development needs is too cumbersome. At the same time, recent press reports indicate that Ohio's employers are having a difficult time finding the highly-skilled workers they need to compete.
   ""When Ohio's vital workforce development dollars are being returned to the federal government, new tools must be developed to ensure the state's workforce and economic development needs are met,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The opportunities are there, but employers cannot find the highly-skilled workers they need. When this happens, there is a disconnect between the needs of our nation's workers, the needs of our nation's employers and the design of the workforce development system. The WIRED Act will help states like Ohio by giving them greater flexibility to tailor workforce and economic development programs to address the needs of the 21st century global marketplace.""
   Sen. Voinovich's bill would authorize three new voluntary programs within the existing WIA framework that would allow states and regions to develop and implement strategies to strengthen or revitalize regional economies by giving states and regions greater flexibility to tailor workforce programs to meet local needs. The bill: 
   * Authorizes states and regions to work with a governor (or governors in the case of multi-state regions) to submit WIRED plans for approval by the Secretary of Labor. The plans must be aimed at crafting targeted workforce development programs that provide enhanced job training and related employment activities in the region. They may include complementary economic development activities. If approved, the plans could allow states to combine a number of different federal workforce and economic development funds;
   * Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to award supplementary grants to assist in implementing a WIRED plan or to carry out other regionally-focused workforce development activities; and
   * Authorizes the use of formula funds available to states and local areas under WIA to carry out regionally-focused workforce development activities without going through the entire WIRED approval process. As stated earlier, some of this vital funding is currently going unused because of the inflexibility of the WIA program.
   By making these three voluntary options broadly available, the bill is intended to empower states and local communities to address the workforce challenges posed by global competition and economic change. The WIRED Act builds and expands upon the principles underlying the WIRED Initiative that was begun by the Department of Labor in 2006 and currently provides assistance to 39 regions across the country, including a WIRED region in southeast Ohio.

VOINOVICH VOTES IN FAVOR OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE
  Sen George V. Voinovich (R-OH) voted today against H.R. 4297, the Tax Relief Act of 2005. The senator's vote-that of a well-known deficit hawk-reflects his strong belief that the decisions he and his colleagues make in the Senate today will affect the lives of their children and grandchildren long after they have left the Senate.  
   ""I voted against additional tax cuts today for three simple reasons: we do not need them right now; we cannot afford them right now; and we should be working on fundamental tax reform rather than tinkering with piecemeal tax cuts. I am thinking not only about our generation, but also the generations of our children and grandchildren and the legacy we leave them. Last November, Alan Greenspan testified before the Joint Economic Committee and warned Congress that we should not be cutting taxes by borrowing: 'We do not have the capability of having both productive tax cuts and large expenditure increases, and presume that the deficit doesn't matter.' I wish my colleagues had heeded his warning,"" said Voinovich. 
   As a former mayor and governor, Senator Voinovich understands the importance of making difficult decisions when necessary. The choices Congress makes right now are being measured against a backdrop of ever-increasing deficits, Medicare costs, disaster relief funding, the cost of the war against terrorism and the challenges of staying competitive in the global marketplace. Senator Voinovich believes the passage of these tax cuts is fiscally irresponsible and has called on his colleagues to be intellectually honest with the American people. 
   The Senator opposed tax cuts at this time for three reasons: 1. The economy is back on track and does not need additional tax cuts. While he voted for tax cuts in 2001, which prevented Congress from spending the projected $5.6 trillion surplus, and he voted for the 2003 tax cuts because the country needed an economic stimulus, Senator Voinovich believes that an overdose of tax cuts will do more harm than good at this time. 2. We cannot afford them at this time because of our soaring deficit and national debt. The reported deficit for FY2005 was $318 billion; taking out the Social Security surplus and using the on-budget deficit, the number was $492 billion; and utilizing the Treasury's accrual accounting method, the deficit was $760 billion. The national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 1999 to $8.4 trillion today - an increase of 50 percent. The House is now contemplating increasing the debt limit to $10 trillion, which, if reached, would be an increase of 78 percent. If the Senate believes we must have them, then we need to pay for them. 3. We should be working on tax reform rather than enacting tax cuts in a piece-meal fashion.

   ""My memories of visiting the Pentagon and being at Ground Zero shortly after the attacks will never fade. I was overcome by the size, scale and devastation of the sites and nothing could have prepared me for the gut-wrenching reaction to these savage acts. 
   ""The brutality of 9/11 shocked the world. But rather than destroying our faith in the American ideals of liberty and freedom, it united us in a way I have never seen before. 
   ""We are still battling the Islamic extremists who attacked us on 9/11. They are still working throughout the world to convince Muslims that the way to get to Heaven is to terrorize - and ultimately destroy - the United States and all who share our values. 
   ""We must not let the victims of 9/11 die in vain. We must continue the Global War on Terror, working with our friends and allies throughout the world to stop the terrorists, deny them safe haven and freeze their financial networks. Only then can we limit their ability to spread fear, resentment, despair and violence among their own people and abroad. 
   ""I have urged President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to be very clear about our objectives in Iraq so that everyone can understand how it relates to the Global War on Terror and the future stability in the Greater Middle East. Without stability in the Middle East, we cannot win the greater ideological battle between moderation and extremism, between those who promote democracy and those who want to destroy freedom. Our mission in Iraq is critical to preventing the Middle East from becoming a massive breeding ground for the terrorists of the future.

Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI). This bill will elevate the roles and responsibilities of the current Undersecretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security to a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security for Management.

""Through this legislation, the creation of a Deputy Secretary for Management will provide essential expertise necessary for improving the long-term efficiency and effectiveness of the department.""
  The individual appointed as the Deputy Secretary for Management will serve a five-year term and be the third highest ranking official at DHS. The roles and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Management include serving as the chief management officer and principal advisor to the secretary on the management of the department, including management integration and transformation in support of homeland security operations and programs.
  The Deputy Secretary for Management will also be responsible for strategic and annual performance planning, identification and tracking of performance measures relating to the responsibilities of the department, as well as the integration and transformation process, including the development of a management integration strategy. 
  In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) added implementing and transforming the Department of Homeland Security to their high-risk list of programs susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. It remains on the 2007 list. The creation of the Deputy Secretary for Management will address the concerns outlined by GAO.

VOINOVICH TO CO-CHAIR SENATE GREAT LAKES TASK FORCE
  On Friday, January 12, Sen. George V. Voinovich, a longtime friend of the Great Lakes, announced that he has become co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. The bipartisan group, part of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, seeks to protect the environmental and economic health of the Great Lakes region.  
  ""Protecting and restoring the Great Lakes has been a top priority for me throughout my political career,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""As co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, I look forward to working with Senator Carl Levin and the Great Lakes delegation in advancing the restoration effort in this critical region. Working in a bipartisan effort, we can achieve this goal and protect the Great Lakes for generations to come."" 
  The Senate and House Great Lakes Task Forces were formed in the mid-1980s by members of the Northeast-Midwest Senate and Congressional Coalitions to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to protect and enhance the region's unique natural resources and economy. The Democratic co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force is Senator Carl Levin (D-MI). Leaders of the House Great Lakes Task Force are Reps. John Dingell (D-MI), Vernon Ehlers (R-MI), Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Louise Slaughter (D-NY).
  Sen. Voinovich has a long history of support for the Great Lakes. In 1967, when he was elected to the state legislature with Lake Erie forming the northern border of his district, he saw firsthand the effects of pollution on Lake Erie and the surrounding region. In response, he committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the Lake and waging what he calls the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" - the battle to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lake.
  Since coming to the Senate in 1999, Senator Voinovich has supported numerous pieces of legislation to ban oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes, protect the Lakes from invasive species like the Asian carp, fight ""dead zones"" that threaten the Lakes' vibrant plant and animal life and fund vital cleanup of contaminated sediments.
  The senator has also joined with federal agencies, governors, mayors, tribes and various other organizations to develop a comprehensive restoration plan for the Great Lakes. After extensive discussions, the Federal Great lakes Interagency Task Force, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, the Great Lakes Cities Initiative, Great Lakes tribes and the Great Lakes Congressional Task Force moved to convene a group now known as the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration (GLRC). Since May 18, 2004, the GLRC has worked hard to develop a comprehensive Great Lakes restoration plan. 
  On July 7, 2005, the GLRC released its draft strategy report and a final comprehensive report was released on December 12, 2005, in Chicago, Illinois. This report reflected a bipartisan effort to help tackle the issue of restoration in the Great Lakes region. Throughout this process, Senator Voinovich has been actively involved, urging the Collaboration to develop a final plan that immediately impacts the Great Lakes in a positive manner while being fiscally responsible. Senator Voinovich will continue to be involved as Congress will likely be asked to implement many of the GLRC recommendations in the 110th Congress.

VOINOVICH TO INTRODUCE LANDMARK TAX AND ENTITLEMENT REFORM BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""deficit hawk"", today will introduced landmark legislation aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. 
   The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced a similar bill in the House.  
   ""Last week I voted against the fiscally irresponsible repeal of the estate tax and called on Congress to heed Americans' demand for fundamental tax and entitlement reform. This legislation shows that I'm serious about that call,"" Sen. Voinovich said. 
   The reported deficit for FY2005 was $318 billion -- and that's not taking into account the funds borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, which brings the total to nearly $500 billion. Even more, when utilizing the Department of Treasury's accrual accounting method, the deficit is a disturbing $760 billion. Also, the national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 1999 to $8.4 trillion today - an increase of 50 percent. Full repeal of the estate tax beginning in 2007 through 2016 would cost $368 billion according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
   ""As a fiscal conservative, I believe we must focus on simplifying the tax code and ensuring the solvency of our entitlement programs,"" Sen. Voinovich said. 
   The Commission will be comprised of 15 voting members, three of which will be appointed by the president, three by the Senate Majority Leader, three by the Senate Minority Leader, three by the Speaker of the House and three by the House Minority Leader. The director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United States will be appointed as non?voting ex?officio members of the Commission to lend their expertise. The president will have the ability to appoint the chair from among the 15 voting members. 
   The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. A minimum of six public town hall meetings will be held throughout the country within one year to determine the scope of the problem and consider solutions. The Commission may consider all policy options, including: 
   Limiting the growth of entitlement spending to ensure that the programs are fiscally sustainable; Strengthening the safety net functions of entitlement programs to provide assistance to the neediest; Making the tax code more efficient and encouraging economic growth; and Looking at ways to increase private savings. 
   ""America's fiscal situation is dire. Nothing is off the table when it comes to ensuring our long-term prosperity and increasing our competitiveness in the global marketplace,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Especially important is the tackling of fundamental tax reform. It could, by some estimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion just in costs associated with preparing their taxes alone. That would be a real tax reduction and it would not cost the Treasury a dime. It would be a tax cut that would guarantee people are paying no more than their fair share and would bring more money into the Federal Treasury."" 
   At the conclusion of the town meetings, the Commission will present a report to Congress detailing the fiscal problems facing future generations as well as a framework of long-term solutions. 
   Within 60 days of the presentation of their report to Congress, the Commission will transmit to Congress a legislative proposal designed to: 
   Address the imbalance between long-term federal spending commitments and projected revenues; Increase net national savings to spur domestic investment and economic growth; and Improve the budget process to place greater emphasis on long?term fiscal issues. 
   The administration and Congress will each have 60 days to review the proposal and develop equivalent proposals if they deem necessary. Any alternative from the administration or Congress would be considered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Congress will be required to vote on the proposals within a specified time period. The proposal with the greatest number of votes would be the Congressional body's preference going into conference. 
   ""The task is daunting, but now is the time to act,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them.""

VOINOVICH OFFERS BUDGET AMENDMENT TO CURB ABUSE OF 'EMERGENCY' SPENDING
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""debt hawk,"" today offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution aimed at stopping Congress's addiction to so-called ""emergency"" spending. The amendment would prohibit any ""emergency"" spending above a designated amount. In effect this amendment would create an emergency reserve fund where a designated amount of money would be put aside each year for true emergencies, rather than allowing an unlimited amount of spending to be classified as ""emergency""-an important step towards responsible budgeting.
   ""We all understand that on occasion we face natural disasters or unanticipated crises such as Hurricane Katrina that require emergency resources,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""For this reason, we cannot estimate all of our emergency spending in the budget. But I am extremely concerned that the emergency designation has been abused in recent years to allow Congress to spend large sums of money outside the budget. It is time for us to be honest with the American people about the true state of our nation's fiscal house and stop relying on smoke and mirrors."" 
   If spending is designated as ""emergency,"" it is exempted from budget controls and spending limits. An example of the sort of emergency spending that concerns Sen. Voinovich is the designation of funding for the 2000 Census as emergency, even though the U.S. Constitution has required a census every 10 years since 1790.
   Sen. Voinovich's amendment would set emergency spending levels for Fiscal Year 2009 at an amount determined by the most recent five-year average of emergency defense spending and the most recent 10-year average for other types of emergencies, as determined by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO).
   The amendment would set the Fiscal Year 2009 emergency designation at $65 billion, reserving $50 billion for the Global War on Terror and leaving another $15 billion for other legitimate emergencies such as natural disasters. The $50 billion set aside for the Global War on Terror would be in addition to the $70 billion already in the Fiscal Year 2009 budget for Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing $120 billion total for the Global War on Terror outside the discretionary spending limits.
   If Congress wants to exceed the emergency reserve fund cap, those additional funds must be counted as part of the regular budget. If this causes Congress to bust through the regular budget limits, the Senate can do so with a supermajority of 60 votes. This vote would act as a penalty flag and force honesty about spending instead of letting Congress use the ""emergency"" designation to claim they are staying within the budget when they are not.
   In last week's GAO report titled ""Supplemental Appropriations: Opportunities Exist to Increase Transparency and Provide Additional Controls"" which was request by Sen. Voinovich, GAO analyzed the use of emergency and supplemental funding over the 10-year period from 1997-2006 and found that:
   * Over $31 billion did not fit the definition of an ""emergency,"" suggesting that the ""emergency"" label is used to exempt non-emergencies from budget controls; 
   * 35 spending accounts received emergency funding in at least six out of 10 years, suggesting that such funding is regular and not an unexpected event; and 
   * Over one-third of emergency spending has no time limit on when agencies can spend the money, suggesting that much ""emergency"" spending occurs long after the emergency has passed.

VOINOVICH OFFERS BUDGET AMENDMENT TO INCREASE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today offered an amendment along with U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution to increase funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) by $477 million, for a total of $1.35 billion. This increase in funding would not increase total budget spending; it would simply set aside a greater portion of already existing funds to the Clean Water SRF. 
   ""I think it is clear that we are facing an environmental and public health crisis in this country when it comes to water infrastructure,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""We cannot expect cities to spend millions of dollars for water infrastructure upgrades without help from the federal government. We have a ticking time bomb ready to blow up if we don't act now.""
   The Clean Water SRF program provides funding to states for water and wastewater infrastructure projects. The EPA estimates our nation needs to invest $390 billion over the next 20 years to eliminate deficiencies in our wastewater infrastructure. The state of Ohio has one of the largest investment needs in the country at $11.7 billion.
   Senator Voinovich believes that the federal government is asking communities to do the impossible. If the federal government is going to impose these costly mandates on struggling state and local governments, then it should provide funding and flexibility for compliance with those mandates.

  ""Ralph and Mary Regula have been close friends for over 40 years and were instrumental in my first election to the Ohio House of Representatives. We have joined forces ever since, starting with our partnering to create the Ohio EPA when I was in the Ohio House and Ralph in the Senate.

His legacy will live on forever through the lives of people he has touched through the programs and projects he has spearheaded, particularly in the areas of recreation, the environment, health care and education. While Ralph will be greatly missed in Congress, Janet and I rejoice that he will have more time to spend with Mary and their wonderful family. Mary is, in her own right, an Ohio treasure as founder of the National First Ladies' Library in Canton, Ohio.""

  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) announced that last night a concurrent resolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of the historic 1946 season, and return from military service, of Major League Baseball Hall of Fame member Bob Feller (H. Con. Res. 449) passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Sen. Mike DeWine sponsored the Senate version (S. Con. Res. 110) with Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) as a cosponsor.  
   ""Bob Feller is not only a great baseball player, but also a model American,"" said Senator DeWine. ""He put aside his baseball career and answered our country's call by enlisting in the Navy during World War II. He returned to baseball after the war and exceeded everyone's expectations, pitching one of the best seasons in baseball history in 1946. It's a season that every Cleveland Indian fan remembers and one that I'm proud to celebrate. I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate joined me in honoring this American hero."" 
   ""My colleagues in the Senate and I are proud to honor the sacrifices and achievements of Bob Feller, a great baseball player who put duty to his country ahead of his career. Not only did he serve honorably in World War II, he accomplished great feats as a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians,"" said Senator Voinovich. ""When I think of wonderful role models, I think of men like Bob Feller."" 
   Bob Feller's Major League Baseball career began when he was signed by the Cleveland Indians in 1935 at the age of 16. In his first Major League appearance in August 1936 he struck out 15 Detroit Tigers. Bob Feller was at the pinnacle of his baseball career when he enlisted in the Navy 2 days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While in the Navy he was able to keep his pitching arm in shape by throwing a ball around the deck of the U.S.S. Alabama where he earned 8 battle stars. He was discharged from the Navy in late 1945 and upon his return home he was able to pitch 9 games for the Indians winning 5 of them. The 1946 season is arguably the best season of Bob Feller's career. He pitched 36 complete games in 42 starts during the 1946 season, attaining a 2.18 earned run average, leading the American League in wins, shutouts, strikeouts, games pitched. His remarkable season also included throwing a no hitter against the New York Yankees on April 30, 1946 and pitching 3 scoreless innings in the 1946 All Star Game. 
   He accomplished all of this amid great speculation that his best pitching days were behind him. At the end of Bob Feller's career in 1956, he had amassed 266 victories and 2,581 strikeouts, because of his outstanding career he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. 
   Congressman Steve LaTourette (R-14th) introduced the Resolution in the House.

VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES OVER $1 MILLION FROM APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION
  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced that over $1 million from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has been approved for vital infrastructure improvements projects in Appalachian Ohio. 
   ""I have and will continue to work hard to help this region meet its economic needs,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The projects funded by these grants will provide potable water to residents, enhance access to quality medical care, support new jobs and the retention of existing jobs and construct new sewer and wastewater systems. This funding will improve the quality of life and further bolster the region's infrastructure.""  
   The funds will be distributed as follows: 
   * $250,000 to Vinton County, Ohio, to install two miles of water line and provide potable water service to 40 households in Harrison Township. 
   * $139,000 to Ohio University for the development of an Electronic Medical Records program that will use computer technology to improve health care delivery for up to 1,100 diabetic patients. 
   * $250,000 to the Ohio Department of Development for the Appalachian Training Investment Partnership program, which will support the creation of 200 new jobs and the retention of 300 existing jobs. 
   * $200,000 to Highland Village, Ohio, for construction of 2.5 miles of sewer lines to serve 113 customers and five businesses in Highland Village and a portion of Fairfield Township in Highland County. 
   * $250,000 to Amesville, Ohio, to construct a decentralized wastewater system to serve its community, including 70 households and 13 businesses and community facilities. 
   In addition to the ARC funds, state, local and other federal funds will contribute $3,228,462 to these projects. 
   In July 2006, the U.S. Senate passed by unanimous consent S. 2832 - vital legislation to reauthorize the ARC at $510.9 million over five years. Sen. Voinovich, a member of the EPW Committee, introduced the bill in May. In April, Sen. Voinovich held a field hearing in Marietta, Ohio, to hear testimony on the impact of the last reauthorization of the ARC and to examine how ARC has made a difference in people's lives. After the hearing, he spent two days traveling around Appalachian Ohio and was extremely impressed with the wonderful strides being made in the region as a result of ARC investments in technology, workforce training and economic development. 
   ARC plays a key role in fostering economic development and improving quality of life for the 23 million people who live and work in Appalachia. The proposed legislation creates the designation of economically ""at risk"" counties and provides an appropriate federal matching rate for ARC-funded projects in those counties. Since ARC's inception, the region's poverty rate has been cut in half (from 31 percent to 13 percent), the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent. 
   During his first term in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich authored the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 (S. 1206), which was signed by the president on March 12, 2002. The bill reauthorized the economic development efforts of the Appalachian Regional Commission, providing $446 million over five years for these efforts, and enacted a new, Voinovich-created technology initiative to help improve the region's telecommunication infrastructure and help businesses and residents take better advantage of e-commerce opportunities.

  In a resolution passed by unanimous consent today, the U.S. Senate called for the immediate and unconditional release of three Israeli soldiers held captive by the Palestinian militant groups, Hamas and Hezbollah. The three soldiers include Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were abducted by Hezbollah on July 12, 2006 and Gilad Shalit, who was kidnapped by Hamas on June 25, 2006. The resolution was sponsored by Sens. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY).
  ""The terrible kidnapping of Israeli soldiers that precipitated the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon last summer, have yet to be resolved. It is essential that Israel's abducted soldiers are returned immediately and unconditionally. This resolution delivers a strong message in support of Israel and in support of the families of the kidnapped soldiers,"" said Sen. Clinton.  
  ""The international community and our allies in the Middle East must realize that it is time to stop letting Hamas and Hezbollah distort our concept of humanity and dictate the timeline for peace in the region,"" said Sen. Voinovich, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Restraint, humanity and patience should not only apply to Israel. We must send the same message to Hamas and Hezbollah and any terrorist who threaten democracy and innocent lives. Hamas and Hezbollah are holding the entire region captive along with these three men and it must come to a swift end.""
  The resolution condemns Hamas and Hezbollah for cross border attacks that led to the kidnappings last year and urges the militant groups to allow prompt medical treatment of the soldiers by representatives of the International Red Cross. It also expresses vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and encourages strong support and deep interest in achieving a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution also expresses ongoing concern and sympathy for the families of the three soldiers and all other missing soldiers of Israel. 
  Last year, Clinton and Voinovich introduced the resolution with Senators Mikulski (D-MD), Brownback (R-KS), Lautenberg (D-NJ), Coleman (R-MN), Lieberman (ID-CT), Schumer (D-NY), Brown (D-OH) and Feinstein (D-CA). 
   [The full text of the resolution is below]
  Title: Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of soldiers of Israel held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah.
   Whereas Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon on May 24, 2000;
   Whereas Congress expressed concern for soldiers of Israel missing in Lebanon and Syrian-controlled territory of Lebanon in the Act entitled ""To locate and secure the return of Zachary Baumel, a United States citizen, and other Israeli soldiers missing in action"", approved November 8, 1999 (Public Law 106-89), which required the Secretary of State to raise the status of missing soldiers of Israel with appropriate government officials of Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and other governments in the region, and to submit to Congress reports on those efforts and any subsequent discovery of relevant information;
   Whereas, on June 18, 2000, the United Nations Security Council welcomed and endorsed the report by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Israel had withdrawn completely from Lebanon under the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (1978);
   Whereas Israel completed its withdrawal from Gaza on September 12, 2005;
   Whereas, on June 25, 2006, Hamas and allied terrorists crossed into Israel to attack a military post, killing 2 soldiers and wounding a third, Gilad Shalit, who was kidnapped;
   Whereas, on July 12, 2006, terrorists of Hezbollah crossed into Israel to attack troops of Israeli patrolling the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon, killing 3 soldiers, wounding 2 more, and kidnapping Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev;
   Whereas Gilad Shalit has been held in captivity by Hamas for more than 7 months;
   Whereas Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev have been held in captivity by Hezbollah for more than 6 months;
   Whereas Hamas and Hezbollah have withheld all information on the health and welfare of the men they have kidnapped; and
   Whereas, contrary to the most basic standards of humanitarian conduct, Hamas and Hezbollah have prevented access to the Israeli captives by competent medical personnel and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That the Senate- 
   (1) demands that-
   (A) Hamas immediately and unconditionally release Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit
   (B) Hezbollah accept the mandate of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) by immediately and unconditionally releasing Israeli soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev; and
   (C) Hezbollah and Hamas accede to the most basic standards of humanitarian conduct and allow prompt access to the Israeli captives by competent medical personnel and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross;
   (2) expresses-
   (A) vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders;
   (B) strong support and deep interest in achieving a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside of the State of Israel;
   (C) ongoing concern and sympathy for the families of Gilad Shalit, Ehud Goldwasser, Eldad Regev, and all other missing soldiers of Israel; and
   (D) full commitment to seek the immediate and unconditional release of the Israeli captives; and

VOINOVICH PRAISES OHIO HOUSE PASSAGE OF NEW GUIDELINES TO PROTECT GREAT LAKES
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), current chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change and Nuclear Safety, on Wednesday, Dec. 13, praised the Ohio House of Representatives for passing House Bill 574 to protect the health of the Great Lakes and aid in the restoration effort. An agreement was signed at this time last year that will ban diversions of water to areas outside of the Great Lakes with only limited exceptions. 
  ""I have long advocated for this action and I'm very pleased the House has brought this one step closer to becoming reality,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This will help save our Great Lakes for future generations. It is critical for Ohio to be a leader in this effort. Getting this bill signed into law quickly will be a tremendous step forward in protecting our national treasure.""
  Sen. Voinovich has from the beginning of his public service committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the Great Lakes. When he was elected to the Ohio State Legislature, he began what he refers to as the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lake.
  Upon entering the Senate in 1999, Sen. Voinovich co-sponsored legislation to impose a two-year moratorium on the export of bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes Basin. In addition to introducing legislation, he actively lobbied administration officials and Great Lakes governors to take action on this important issue. In 2001, he spoke at the University of Toledo's Great Lakes Conference about the need to improve Great Lakes water management.
  Sen. Voinovich authored the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA). He included a provision that ""?encourage[d] the Great Lakes states, in consultation with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, to develop and implement a mechanism that provides a common conservation standard embodying the principles of water conservation and resource improvement for making decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the Great Lakes Basin.""
  Following the enactment of WRDA, the Great Lakes governors of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin joined with the premiers of Ontario and Quebec in signing the Great Lakes Charter Annex 2001 in Niagara Falls, New York, on June 18, 2001.
  Annex 2001 amended the Great Lakes Charter of 1985 to update the Great Lakes regional water management system and ensure that the Great Lakes are protected for future generations. Since 2001, the Great Lakes governors and premiers have been working hard to implement the Annex. The document signed last year provides guidelines for protecting the Great Lakes through better water management.
  All eight Great Lakes states must ratify the agreement through their state legislatures. The U.S. Congress would then have to approve the Compact before becoming fully effective, while no federal legislation is required in Canada.

  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday, Dec. 13, released the following statement on Iran's Holocaust denial meeting:  
  ""Back in September I compared Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Adolf Hitler and called him a madman. Now that he's convened this meeting denying the Holocaust, I don't think any rational person could disagree with my previous assessment. Today's meeting - along with his previous statements that the Holocaust is a myth and that Israel should be wiped off the map - proves that he is indeed a Hitler-like madman. 
  ""Those who have recently urged the administration to engage directly with Iran over the issue of Iraq should pay close attention to the message coming from this meeting. And if direct talks are to occur with Iran, they should take place without its president. If we had isolated Hitler when we first saw the warning signs, the world may have never suffered his wrath.
  ""Unless all Arab leaders make it clear that Israel has a right to exist, there will never be a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, and there will never be true peace in the Middle East."".

Specifically, he asks them to work with Senate leadership to take up the House-passed version of the bill, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, and get it to the president's desk before we adjourn for the year:

   The Honorable Charles Grassley
  Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee
  219 Dirksen Senate Office Building
  Washington, D.C. 20510
   Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley:
   Thank you for calling today's hearing in the Finance Committee regarding the current housing market and the crisis impacting so many of America's homeowners. I look forward to hearing the witnesses' testimonies, as well as the questions and feedback from members of the Finance Committee. Your timely action is encouraging to me as we continue the work of the Senate in the few remaining days of the legislative session.
   It is my hope that the hearing, aptly titled, ""The Housing Decline: The Extent of the Problem and Potential Remedies,"" will result in action by the Senate to provide relief to troubled homeowners. As you well know, Senator Stabenow and I introduced the Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act (S. 1394) back in May to change the tax code so that homeowners are not penalized when they work out a deal that keeps them in their home or they sell their home for less than the outstanding debt. While I applaud your leadership on addressing the housing crisis and calling today's hearing, I believe the Senate must send legislation to President Bush's desk this year, and cannot afford to wait to enact mortgage debt relief legislation as part of a larger package next year.
   In my previous letter to you, I spoke of the housing crisis in my home state of Ohio. In fact, three houses right in my neighborhood in Cleveland are boarded up - the previous owners, victims of foreclosure. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer just reported that three mayoral candidates are in danger of foreclosure. Therefore, I understand on a very personal level how the foreclosure crisis is ruining our country's neighborhoods.
   It is my strong belief that a unanimous consent agreement to take up the House-passed version of H.R. 3648 - the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 - as a stand alone provision would be the surest method to enactment this year. The House has already acted with an overwhelming majority, and now we must push this legislation across the goal line in the Senate before we leave town for the holidays.
   Enacting mortgage cancellation relief legislation before year end is critical in addressing the housing crisis sweeping the nation. I encourage you to work with Senate Leadership to reach an agreement to send the President this bipartisan legislation to encourage homeowners to work out agreements with their lenders. I look forward to our continued partnership to address this critical challenge.
   Sincerely,
   George V. Voinovich
  United States Senator

VOINOVICH VOTES AGAINST CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND FOR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""debt hawk,"" on Tuesday, Feb. 13, voted against cloture on H.J. Res. 20, the FY 2007 Continuing Resolution (C.R.). His vote against cloture represents his frustration with Congress' continued willingness to pass the buck on real budgeting and settle for a wasteful and inefficient C.R. that shortchanges vital federal and state projects, including Base Realignment and Closure funding. 
  ""I am very disappointed in my colleagues who continue to pass the buck on real budgeting and settle for a continuing resolution,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Repeatedly managing by continuing resolution as we've done for nearly half a year is inherently irresponsible and inefficient. I believe this lazy budgeting strategy is a horrible way to run the government. It results in wasteful spending, disruptions and chaos in federal programs and productivity slowdowns.""  
  Sen. Voinovich pointed out that, because of the Senate's indolence, many federal agencies have been in limbo during the last several months. In recent years many federal departments have taken positive steps toward streamlining their budgets and tightening the reins of daily operations, conduct that ought to be rewarded. Instead, when Congress failed to complete its appropriation work on time, these departments were forced to put critical projects on hold.
  And it is not just the federal government that suffers. States, counties and cities all depend on funding from Washington. In Ohio, for instance, construction costs and inflation forced the Department of Transportation to cancel or postpone nearly $450 million in highway projects, because they simply didn't know how much funding they were going to get.
  ""I am especially disappointed that a select few have taken it upon themselves to choose for the entire nation and for the president where vital military facility funding should be focused,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The BRAC funding cuts included in the continuing resolution are a gimmick at best. The Democrats have cut BRAC funding by $3.1 billion in the bill and used that money to fund other programs - still, they admit that the $3.1 billion will be added back to the war supplemental. At the end of the day, the $3.1 billion will be spent twice for a total of $6.2 billion - once on BRAC and once on pet projects. But the Democrats only count $3.1 billion as spending. This is not only a way to cheat the budget caps, but it will delay the implementation of BRAC recommendations that benefit Ohio. If BRAC is, in fact, shortchanged in the final version of the continuing resolution, I will do everything in my power to ensure that Congress is held to the commitment it made when it takes up the supplemental.
  ""It is time for us to be intellectually honest with the American people. These are not isolated instances. In 25 of the past 30 years, Congress has failed to enact all the appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year. When are we planning to get it done on time? By failing to do our job, we are starving the executive branch of government and preventing it from doing its job. 
  ""I believe that implementing a biennial or two-year budget cycle would be a responsible first step and I plan to introduce legislation to do just that this year. The first year would be reserved for the budget and appropriations process. The second year would be to conduct oversight and pass authorizing legislation. This would leave Congress more time to examine programs to determine which are wasteful, which should receive more funding and which should be terminated altogether. And Congress would have more time to finish its business by the deadlines the law imposes.""

  U.S. Senator Harry Reid
   Majority Leader
   Washington, D.C. 20510
  U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell
   Minority Leader
   Washington, D.C. 20510
  Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell:
  I am pleased to learn that the two of you are optimistic that the 110th Congress can tackle our nation's long-term fiscal problems working together on a bipartisan basis. I understand that a bipartisan group of senators is discussing the creation of a commission to grapple with difficult-but-necessary reforms to our tax and entitlement systems. I am greatly heartened by this development, as I have been a strong public advocate for both tax reform and entitlement reform for several years, and I believe that any enduring solutions to our long-term fiscal imbalance must have genuine bipartisan support. I look forward to working with you and to being actively involved in these critical discussions as the Senate begins to address our nation's fiscal health.
  In fact, I thought I would bring to your attention legislation that I, along with Rep. Frank Wolf, introduced to create just such a bipartisan commission. In the 109th Congress, Rep. Wolf and I introduced the Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act, S. 3491 and H.R. 5552, which would establish a national commission to examine our tax and entitlement systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course, reform the tax code for a 21st century global economy, and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. Outside groups such as the Concord Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the Brookings Institution, as well as Comptroller General David Walker, have voiced support for our approach. (I have attached a recent Washington Post op-ed by former Senators Warren Rudman and Bob Kerrey endorsing the SAFE Commission.) Rep. Wolf and I plan to re-introduce the SAFE Commission Act next week, with modifications intended to address concerns raised by both Democrats and Republicans.
  The SAFE Commission Act is innovative because it establishes expedited procedures to ensure that Congress votes on the Commission's proposals. Congress, however, would be allowed to develop and consider its own alternatives to the Commission bill. Thus, Congress would not be bound by the SAFE Commission's bill. In fact, I fully expect that Congress would adopt its own alternative in lieu of the Commission bill. At the end of the day, Congress would make the tough policy choices. The Commission, however, would force Congress to act rather than kick the can down the road.
  The SAFE Commission would be truly bipartisan, with voting members evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Four of the 16 members would be sitting Members of Congress. Non-voting members would include the CBO Director and the Comptroller General. A three-fourths supermajority would be required to submit legislative language to Congress, thus ensuring substantial support from both parties. The SAFE Commission could not adopt a partisan proposal with one or two cross-over votes.
  I intend to focus on tax reform and addressing our long-term fiscal imbalance as top priorities in the 110th Congress. As you move forward on these issues on a bipartisan basis, I hope to work with you toward the common goal of securing America's future economy.
  Sincerely,
   George V. Voinovich
   United States Senator

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES LANDMARK BIENNIAL BUDGET BILL
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""debt hawk,"" today joined other Republican colleagues in introducing landmark legislation, the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act, aimed at converting the annual budget cycle into a biennial - or two year - cycle. This would save Congress valuable time eaten up every year debating appropriations matters and allow it to focus on oversight of the programs being funded which are currently neglected in the one year budget cycle. 
  ""In 25 of the past 30 years, Congress has failed to enact all the appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This irresponsible fiscal policy affects our ability to fight the War on Terror, interferes with our ability to maintain and improve our infrastructure and impedes efforts to enhance our education system. By failing to do our job, we are starving federal agencies and preventing them from doing their job. This is irresponsible management and it has to stop.""  
   Under biennial budgeting, the annual budget, appropriations and authorizing processes would be converted into a two-year cycle: the first year would be reserved for the budget and appropriations process and the second year would be for conducting oversight and passing authorizing legislation. This would leave Congress with more time to examine programs to determine which are wasteful, which should receive more funding and which should be terminated altogether. 
   ""The task is daunting, but now is the time to act,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them.""
   The bill is co-sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Conference Chairman Lamar Alexander, Policy Committee Chairman Kay Bailey Hutchison, Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Pete Domenici, Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss as well as Senators Johnny Isakson, Jeff Sessions and Bob Corker.
  Please find a one-pager on the legislation attached below. 
  BIENNIAL BUDGETING AND APPROPRIATIONS ACT
   * The bill would convert the annual budget, appropriations, and authorizing process to a biennial, or two year cycle. 
   * First Year - Budget and Appropriations: 
   * Requires the President to submit a two-year budget at the beginning of the first session of a Congress 
   * Requires Congress to adopt a two-year budget resolution, a reconciliation bill (if necessary), and two year appropriations bills during the first session of a Congress 
   * Ensures enactment of two year appropriations bills by providing a new majority point of order against consideration of an appropriations bill that fails to cover two years. 
   * Second Year - Authorization Legislation and Enhanced Oversight 
   * Devotes the second session of a Congress to consideration of authorization bills and oversight of federal programs. Provides a majority point of order against consideration of authorization and revenue legislation that covers less than two years 
   * Enhances oversight by incorporating features of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) in the second year of the biennium by requiring 
   * The General Accounting Office (GAO) to give priority to requests for audits and evaluation of programs and activities during the second year of the biennium 
   * Agencies to submit to the authorizing committees at the beginning of the second session of a Congress proposed legislative changes that are needed or will assist agencies' efforts to meet their GPRA mission statements, strategic plans and performance goals; an

VOINOVICH SECURES ADDITIONAL $15 MILLION FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS IN SENATE
  Today, an amendment proposed by Sen. George V. Voinovich requesting an additional $15 million for the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program was unanimously accepted to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, bringing the total funding for the Emergency Management Performance Grant program to $220 million.  
   The EMPG program is designed to provide state and local emergency management agencies with the necessary funds to expand the development, maintenance and improvement of their programs. It is the only source of federal assistance that provides vital emergency management, coordination and planning support to state and local governments, emergency managers, and first responders. 
   ""Since 9/11, the responsibilities of our first responders have increased exponentially. They must now be prepared to respond to natural disasters, man-made disasters and malicious acts of terrorism and we must support them,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""With the enhanced responsibilities, and the tight budget constraints currently faced by state and local governments, the flexibility provided by the EMPG program is vital. It is my strong belief that an additional $15 million for the EMPG program will enhance the effectiveness of every dollar directed toward response and recovery."" 
   Last year the EMPG program was funded at $185 million. In an effort to increase the sound management of homeland security funds, earlier this year Sen. Voinovich asked the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security to increase funding for the EMPG program. The program requires that states match 50 percent of the federal contribution. 
   According to the Department of Homeland Security, EMPG funds are spent rapidly compared to other programs; in other words, if Congress appropriates additional EMPG funding, it will be used expeditiously, efficiently and effectively. A different version of this bill passed in the House and will now be negotiated in Conference. The senator will send a letter to conferees urging them to keep the $220 million in the Senate bill whole.

  LEADING THE FIGHT FOR COMPREHENSIVE PASSPORT REFORM
   As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Voinovich has taken a leading role in numerous efforts to alleviate the recent passport backlog and ensure these problems are not repeated. Recently the senator attended a Foreign Relations Committee hearing during which he questioned State Department officials in an effort to learn why the agency failed to plan for the increased demand due to the advent of summer travel season and increased security requirements. A longtime champion of accountability and responsible management, Sen. Voinovich voiced his concerns with the lack of management focus by State Department leadership that contributed to the backlog. Sen. Voinovich has also worked with Ohioans experiencing passport problems to cut through bureaucratic red tape and expedite the process. In fact, the senator's office has already dealt with 1,200 passport cases in 2007 and helped many families avoid losing money and missing long-planned international travel.
   PROMOTING ETHANOL IN FAYETTE COUNTY  
   Last month, Sen. Voinovich attended a check presentation ceremony celebrating Fayette County's recent economic development grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The $2.4 million Economic Development Administration (EDA) grant will help the Madison Mills Water Supply Project - a new water supply system that will provide 1.5 million gallons of water a day to the ethanol plant being constructed near the Village of Bloomingburg. Sen. Voinovich believes we need a Second Declaration of Independence - independence from foreign sources of energy - in order to strengthen our economic and national security. Ethanol is one of the most successful alternative forms of energy. The project will employ up to 100 local contractors to construct the facility. Once constructed and operational, the ethanol plant will employ approximately 60 highly skilled workers and will generate private investment in excess of $142 million. By providing the water infrastructure, the $7.2 million project will enable the new ASAlliances Biofuels ethanol plant to produce 100 million gallons of ethanol.
   PROVIDING A WAY FORWARD IN IRAQ 
   Sen. Voinovich, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recently sent President Bush a letter expressing his belief that we must begin to develop a comprehensive plan to secure and stabilize Iraq by gradually drawing down our military while ramping up our political and diplomatic efforts and holding Iraqis and their neighbors responsible for Iraq's future. Along with the letter, Sen. Voinovich sent the president a strategy paper titled ""The Way Forward in Iraq."" For a complete version of the letter and the plan, please see the senator's Web site. 
   DEDICATING TOLEDO'S SKYWAY BRIDGE 
   Sen. Voinovich recently attended the Veterans' Glass City Skyway (VGCS) Dedication Ceremony. Sen. Voinovich has been involved in the VGCS project since his time as governor of Ohio. As part of his Good Government Initiative, then-Governor Voinovich ""took the politics"" out of Ohio Department of Transportation's project selection process. Working with the legislature, he created the Transportation Review Advisory Council, which was influential in the project's execution. As governor, he began the process of developing new funding sources for the bridge. The new bridge will relieve congestion in the region and boost the economic prosperity of the entire state. In the past, all vehicular traffic on I-280 was halted whenever the Craig Memorial Bridge opened for ships. The bridge represents the innovative capabilities being implemented in cable-stayed bridge technology.
   COMMEMORATING THE HUNGARIAN COMMUNITY 
   As a longtime champion of Ohio's ethnic heritage, Sen. Voinovich joined the Hungarian Community in Cleveland recently as they dedicated a statue commemorating the 1956 Hungarian Revolution Freedom Fighters. The dedication was sponsored by the Cleveland Hungarian Revolution 50th Anniversary Committee, which held a week of events last year to commemorate the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Sen. Voinovich has a long-standing relationship with the Hungarian Community in Cleveland and was proud to participate in this wonderful event.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO INVIGORATE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL PROCESS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, today introduced legislation to strengthen and improve the federal government's employee performance appraisal system and require regular and appropriate training for individuals in supervisory or managerial positions. The primary goal of Sen. George V. Voinovich's Federal Workforce Performance Appraisal and Management Improvement Act of 2006 is to institutionalize the dialogue between employees and managers in order to foster a culture in the federal government of a high-performing, continually improving organization focused on achieving results for the American people.  
   ""I believe that an effective performance management system is fundamental to building a results-oriented organization,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""By developing a system where employees have regular discussions with their supervisors about expectations for their performance, both employees and supervisors will be more effective in achieving their agency's mission."" 
   While some organizations have taken steps to modernize their performance management systems and tools, there is no comprehensive, governmentwide mandate to do so. Sen. Voinovich's legislation would begin the reform process by layering a modern performance management system over the existing General Schedule system. 
   ""I am introducing this legislation because I believe that employees should receive a rigorous evaluation each year and that their pay should be determined based upon their performance,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""I agree with the observation that has been made repeatedly by Comptroller General David Walker: an employee's pay should be determined by productivity, effectiveness, and contributions of that employee."" 
   Passage of the Federal Workforce Performance Appraisal and Management Improvement Act of 2006 would accomplish the following: 
   Require that every federal employee receive annually a written performance appraisal. That appraisal must align with the agency's strategic goals, be developed with the employee, make meaningful distinctions among employee performance and use the results in making decisions for training, rewarding, promoting, reassigning and removing employees; Require the Office of Personnel Management to provide technical assistance to agencies and approve the system. The government must utilize the Office of Personnel Management's institutional expertise; Require that managers receive the appropriate training to judge the performance of their subordinates, make expectations clear to employees and provide constructive feedback; Would stipulate that if an employee does not achieve a successful rating under the new appraisal system, then that employee would be ineligible for the annual pay increase or a within-grade increase; and Would permit individuals hired as senior level or senior technical to access level II of the Executive Schedule with an OPM certified performance appraisal system, consistent with the statute for the Senior Executive Service. 
   ""This will require a significant commitment of behalf of managers and leaders,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Instead of taking one giant bite at the apple, I believe it will be easier for federal agencies to implement enhanced employee appraisals first. By instituting a more rigorous performance management standard on top of the current general schedule, I am optimistic this will create less anxiety among federal employees.""

  MESSAGE FROM SEN. VOINOVICH 
   Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. Communicating with my constituents has always been a top priority for me, and I look forward to regularly updating you on the work I'm doing to help Ohio and the nation. It has recently been very busy in Washington, but I have had several opportunities to return to Ohio to work on a wide range of issues. I hope you will find the information in this e-newsletter helpful. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to visit my Web site at http://voinovich.senate.gov. And please share this e-newsletter with your friends and family by forwarding it to their email! 
   FIGHTING FOR HOME OWNERS  
   Senator Voinovich believes that owning a home creates a foundation for strong communities and builds a healthier economy. He recently met with several members of the Ohio Home Builders Association. Since joining the Senate, Sen. Voinovich has voted in favor of legislation to assist homebuyers, including the 2003 American Dream Downpayment Act, which promised to aid approximately 40,000 families with down payments and closing costs on their first homes. Additionally, he supported the 2005 federal budget which called for $45 million to support 550,000 families with homeownership counseling while purchasing a home.
   Most recently, Sen. Voinovich introduced the Mortgage Relief Act - legislation to change current law that forces individuals to pay income tax when they have part of their mortgage loan forgiven or are forced to foreclose because of an inability to pay their mortgage. The senator believes that removing this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided. And he strongly believes it's unfair to tax people on their loses when they're already struggling. 
   SCRAPPING THE TAX CODE 
   Senator Voinovich, the Senate's top ""deficit hawk,"" recently co-sponsored the Tax Code Termination Act - legislation that would repeal the U.S. Tax Code by 2010 and force Congress to reauthorize it or replace it with a new system that's fair and easy to understand. Sen. Voinovich believes that while it won't be easy to pass this legislation, it will at least help bring attention to this problem, and force Congress and the administration to deal with these looming issues instead of passing the buck to future generations.
   Also, Sen. Voinovich has re-introduced legislation aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. 
   SUPPORTING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT 
   Dating back to his service as mayor and governor, Senator Voinovich has been an active voice in promoting early education programs. Most recently, the senator was a keynote speaker at the ZERO TO THREE policy conference - a national summit held in Cleveland on early childhood development.
   Sen. Voinovich participated in the summit proceedings, which included listening to policy recommendations from the community. Sen. Voinovich believes it is our moral responsibility to make sure our children are healthy and enter school ready to learn and he is committed to giving every child the chance they deserve in gaining an education. Programs such as ZERO TO THREE at the national level and Cuyahoga County 's Invest In Children do a great job of building coordinated systems of services for young children and their families. 
   PROVIDING RELIEF FROM FUTURE HIGH GAS PRICES 
   In an effort to provide Americans relief from record high gas prices, Senator Voinovich was part of a bipartisan group of Senators that introduced legislation recently to expand consumer access to 85 percent ethanol fuel, or E-85 - an affordable, home-grown alternative to gasoline. The legislation for the Ethanol Education and Expansion Act of 2007 would work to reduce prices at the pump for consumers by providing grants through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to farmer-owned ethanol producers to install additional E-85 pumps at rural gas stations as well as the equipment needed to sell E-85 directly to gas stations.
   The bill aims to dramatically increase the availability of E-85, making it a viable source of fuel for everyday Americans who are committed to the nation's energy independence. Sen. Voinovich has always made what he calls a ""Second Declaration of Independence"" a top priority in his agenda, and this legislation is the next step toward making our nation less reliant on foreign sources on energy. 
   EXPANSION OF NASA CENTER BRINGS NEW JOBS TO OHIO 
   Senator Voinovich recently spoke at a dedication ceremony at NASA's Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio . The facility recently received approval and funding for simulated environmental testing of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) - the spacecraft that will support exploration missions to the International Space Station, the moon and Mars. Sen. Voinovich facilitated a recent meeting with NASA and local officials and directly lobbied the NASA administrator to get this accomplished. 
   Testing of the CEV is part of a new mission for NASA Glenn, which includes designing the CEV as well as overseeing the development of several Crew Launch Vehicle upper stage systems. This new mission will secure NASA Glenn and assist with the growth of the economy and creation of jobs in northern Ohio. 
   Sen. Voinovich has been involved for many years with the programs at NASA Glenn and he is excited about what this new program means for the region. He is pleased that NASA Glenn has obtained an identifiable mission and will work hard to secure the funding it needs to thrive. These developments truly represent the launching of a new chapter in the history of NASA Glenn and northern Ohio.

   Sen. Voinovich also offered this amendment as part of the last year's Budget Resolution and it was accepted by unanimous consent. Unfortunately it was dropped during conference and was not included in the final Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Resolution 
   ""I hope my colleagues will agree to finally fix this loophole,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Experts say the most important step you can take is to first admit you have a problem. Well, we've got a big problem. Let's finally admit it and fix it."" 
   Currently, every time new entitlement spending or tax cuts are enacted - and are financed through additional borrowing - the level of interest payments the government has to make on its debt increases. Those new interest costs represent additional government spending. Yet, CBO cost estimates ignore the effect of these interest payments on spending and the national debt, yet Congress still accepts those inaccurate figures.

VOINOVICH OFFERS TAX AND ENTITLEMENT REFORM AMENDMENT
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""debt hawk,"" today offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution that would provide $1 million towards the establishment of a national commission focused on comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. 
   ""America's fiscal situation is dire. Nothing is off the table when it comes to ensuring our long-term prosperity and increasing our competitiveness in the global marketplace,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This $1 million dollar investment is a pittance compared to the enormous savings potential. Fundamental tax reform could, by some estimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion in costs associated with preparing their taxes alone. That would be a real tax reduction and it would not cost the Treasury a dime. It would be a tax cut that would guarantee people are paying no more than their fair share and would bring more money into the Federal Treasury.""
   The funds would go towards the administrative costs of establishing a national commission such as the Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission, or a similar proposal, like the bipartisan fiscal task force recently proposed by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) and Ranking Member Judd Gregg (R-NH) - which is almost identical to the SAFE Commission. 
   The SAFE Commission would examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. Sen. Voinovich introduced the SAFE Act last year in support of establishing such a commission and forcing Congress to take action on comprehensive tax and entitlement reform. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced a similar bill in the House.
   The reported deficit for FY2007 was $162 billion - and that's not taking into account the funds borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, which brings the total to nearly $344 billion. Also, the national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 1999 to $9.4 trillion today - an increase of 68 percent. 
   ""As a fiscal conservative, I believe we must focus on simplifying the tax code and ensuring the solvency of our entitlement programs,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The task is daunting, but now is the time to act. I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them.""

Currently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency does not hold the authority to conduct the necessary long-term monitoring of health impacts following environmental exposures in the wake of a disaster. 
   ""This issue first came to my attention during a series of hearings in 2002, when my colleagues and I learned of the severe health problems facing the thousands of workers and volunteers who heroically responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""It is extremely important that we take care of these individuals who bravely gave of themselves to help those in need. Whether people will volunteer to be first responders in the future depends on how the first responders on 9/11 and other disaster areas are treated. We must take care of our heroes."" 
   A five-year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders confirmed suspicions about the effects of having worked at the World Trade Center (WTC) site. According to the findings, almost 70 percent of WTC responders had a new or substantially worsened respiratory symptom following their work at the WTC. Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9/11, 61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC. 
   Ohio Task Force One, comprised of Miami Valley-area fire and rescue personnel, was one of the first to respond to the WTC. Sen. Voinovich met with the group in 2003 to discuss their progress in receiving reimbursement from FEMA for 9/11-related health care expenses. After the meeting, he announced a $12 million national program to provide free medical screenings to eligible fire and rescue personnel and other first responders who worked at the WTC following the 9/11 attacks. 
   The Senate passed this bill by Unanimous Consent in the 108th Congress, but it failed to move through the House.

VOINOVICH HELPS SECURE $3 MILLION FOR OHIO TRANSPORTATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
  The United States Senate passed the 2008 Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill (TTHUD) yesterday by a vote of 88 to 7. U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) secured $3 million in funding for several Ohio transportation and economic development projects in the bill. 
   ""A strong infrastructure is vital to the future of our state and the quality of our citizens' lives,"" said Sen. Voinovich. ""These funds will work to improve economic development in Ohio by improving our state's infrastructure, making our roads safer and allowing Ohio's citizens and businesses to travel more efficiently,"" 
   The TTHUD Appropriations Conference Report includes the following Ohio projects:
   Cuyahoga County:
   $500,000 for City of Cleveland's Flats East Bank Road Relocations and Improvements Project: Funds will be used for the relocation of the roads for the construction of the Flats East Bank Project, a $329 million mixed-use residential and commercial waterfront development. These transportation improvements will provide more efficient access to this new regional center of commerce and jobs. 
   $500,000 for the Goodrich-Gannett Neighborhood Center in the City of Cleveland: Funding will assist the Goodrich-Gannett Neighborhood Center, which provides a variety of social services to preschoolers, youth, families and the elderly, with the completion of a new Childcare/Family Services Facility. The new facility will permit Goodrich-Gannett to expand early childhood development opportunities and house a Resource Center for Working for Working Families that will parents become more effective caregivers, workers and community members.
   Franklin County
   $500,000 for the Interstate 70/71 Cap Project in the City of Columbus: Funding will be used for reconstruction of the 70/71 split in downtown Columbus. 
   Hamilton County:
   $500,000 for I-71 Access Improvements in the City of Cincinnati: Funding will be used to study and design modifications to the highways, interchanges, and transit systems to provide improved access to Uptown and other Cincinnati neighborhoods adjacent to I-71. State and local transportation officials have determined that the I-71 Corridor will operate at Level of Service F by the year 2030 if no improvements are implemented to enhance mobility. 
   $1 million for the Brent Spence Bridge Study in the City of Cincinnati: Funding will be used to study and design modifications to the highway, interchanges and transit systems in the I-75 Corridor from the Ohio River to the Western Hills Viaduct in coordination with the redesign of the Brent Spence Bridge.

  Today, the U.S. Senate passed S.2338, legislation aimed at resetting interest rates to refinance without the usual burdens associated with a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, by a vote of 93 to 1. Much of the bill language was taken from the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007 - legislation introduced by U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) last month in order to spur action by the Senate to help ease the foreclosure crisis and increase homeownership opportunities for millions of American first-time home buyers. The House version of this bill passed overwhelmingly last year by a vote a 415-7. This is the second of two bills introduced by the senator aimed at easing this crisis. 
   ""I am pleased that my colleagues have finally taken real action to not only help ease the current foreclosure crisis but also break down the barriers that separate Americans from the dream of homeownership,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""We must continue to do everything in our power to help Americans in immediate need while fighting to create an ownership society."" 
   S. 2338, which was stagnating in the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs prior to the introduction of Sen. Voinovich's bill, will enable FHA to help those facing foreclosure to refinance for lower rates while helping millions of more low- and moderate-income families to buy a first home. Many of these borrowers currently must pay subprime rates because FHA lacks the ability to offer an affordable financing option. 
   FHA was created in 1934 to give homebuyers access to reasonably priced mortgages under fair terms. Since then, it has been able to help more than 34 million families become homeowners. This legislation will modernize FHA and offer Americans a variety of safe homeownership options at a fair price.
   S.2338 will do the following:
   1) Reduces the current statutory 3 percent minimum down payment to 1.5 percent, reducing a significant barrier to homeownership. FHA's existing down payment requirement does not meet the demands of today's marketplace, where most first-time homebuyers put down 3 percent or less.
   2) Increase and simplify FHA's loan limits. FHA's loan limit in high-cost areas would rise from 87 to 100 percent of the GSE conforming loan limit and in lower-cost areas from 48 to 65 percent of the conforming loan limit. This change is crucial in today's housing market. In many areas of the country, the existing FHA limits are lower than the cost of new construction, eliminating FHA financing as an option for buyers of new homes in those markets. FHA has simply been priced out of the market in other areas, such as California, where FHA insured only about 5,000 home mortgages in all of 2005, down 95 percent from 109,000 in 2000.
   3) Creates a new counseling program for troubled homeowners. The bill creates a pre-purchase counseling demonstration to test the effectiveness of a variety of counseling options. The bill also significantly expands eligibility for post-purchase counseling for low- and moderate-income homeowners who are having trouble making their mortgage payments.
   The passage of S.2338 is the first component in Sen. Voinovich's legislative strategy to assist struggling homeowners in avoiding foreclosure. The second component addresses the tax consequences of debt forgiveness. 
   Declining home prices and rising foreclosure rates have forced more and more families - often minorities, the elderly and immigrants - to sell their homes for less than they paid for them, and sometimes for less than the outstanding debt. Others have worked out a deal with their lenders where part of their mortgage debt has been forgiven. The Internal Revenue Service currently taxes any loan forgiveness as ""income."" 
   That's why Sen. Voinovich introduced the Mortgage Relief Act of 2007 in May - legislation which will relieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the mortgage on a principal residence. The Mortgage Relief Act passed the House in October 386-27 but has yet to be voted on in the Senate. He is pushing hard for the Senate to pass the Mortgage Relief Act before Christmas recess and is working with Senate leadership to make that happen.
   ""Clearly it is unfair to tax people on income that doesn't exist,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This is particularly true at a time when they have experienced a substantial economic loss on the most significant asset they own and have no way to pay the tax. This tax is unfair and must end immediately.""

VOINOVICH CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO HELP PROTECT GREAT LAKES FROM INVASIVE SPECIES
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has signed on to co-sponsor legislation introduced today that lists three species of Asian Carp as injurious wildlife under the Lacey Act, ensuring that the species cannot be imported into the United States or across state lines without a permit. The Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act will prevent live Bighead, Black, and Silver carp from invading the Great Lakes. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI), co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, are authoring the Act.  
   ""This pivotal legislation will send a clear message to the Great Lakes states-we are committed to protecting the Lakes from all invasive species, including Asian Carp. We have worked hard to revitalize the Lakes and these foreign species are a serious threat to the native fish population, ecosystem, and boating community. We need to do everything in our power to help guard against them,"" said Senator Voinovich. 
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) received a petition in 2002 to list the Asian Carp under the Lacey Act. There were also 2 letters from the Great Lakes Task Force urging the FWS to administratively list the carp under the Lacey Act. However, the FWS has not acted on the petition. 
   The Lacey Act provides authority to the Secretary of the Interior to designate injurious wildlife and is part of the critical effort to gain control over the importation of such species. 
   The legislation will not interfere with existing state regulations of Asian carp and permits the importation of the carp for scientific, medical, or educational purposes. 
   The three species of Asian Carp-black, bighead, and silver-threaten native fish by quickly consuming large quantities of phytoplankton, which is critical to the stability of the ecosystem. Originally, they were introduced to the United States as a management tool for aqua culture farms and sewage treatment facilities. According to reports, the carp made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River more than 10 years ago. Asian Carp can grow to an average of four feet and 60 pounds, and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day. 
   Since the beginning of his political career, Senator Voinovich has committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the Great Lakes. Thirty-seven years ago, when he was elected to the Ohio State Legislature, he waged what he refers to as the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lakes. 
   Through his efforts in the Senate, Senator Voinovich was influential in providing important funding for the construction of preventive electric barriers located on the Illinois River and in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to help avert Asian Carp from reaching the Great Lakes.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES BROWNFIELD SITE CLEANUP BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today introduced the America's Brownfield Cleanup Act - legislation to provide incentives to clean up abandoned industrial sites, or Brownfields, across the country and put them back into productive use and preserve green space. 
   ""Brownfield sites represent real environmental threats but also vital opportunities for job creation and economic development. Since they're frequently located in distressed areas where jobs are most needed, this legislation is critical,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""As the former mayor of Cleveland, I experienced firsthand the difficulties that cities face in redeveloping these sites for reuse. This bill is a vital step toward putting Brownfield sites back into use for new business creation and expansion.""  
   The legislation provides $1 billion in federal tax credits - called environmental remediation credits - allocated to states according to population. These credits, which are transferable, would cover 50 percent of the qualified remediation expenditures at a qualified contaminated site in an eligible area. Eligible areas are local government areas with at least one census tract with a 20 percent poverty rate and Indian tribal lands. 
   ""This legislation builds upon the success of state programs such as Ohio's voluntary cleanup program which, to date, has successfully cleaned up approximately 185 sites,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""My bill provides even more incentives to clean up Brownfield sites in order to provide better protection for the health and safety of our citizens and the environment. It also provides additional tools to recycle our urban wastelands, prevent urban sprawl and preserve our farmland and green space. We will be able to clean up industrial eyesores in our cities and make them more desirable and economically prosperous places to live."" 
   Qualified remediation expenditures include: 
   Abatement or control of any hazardous substance as defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which was enacted in 1980, including petroleum and petroleum by-products. This is the same definition used in the 2002 Brownfields legislation; Demolition of any structure if any portion of the structure is demolished in the abatement; Removal and disposal of the contaminated property (debris); and Reconstruction of utilities. 
   In order to receive these credits, two approved plans must be in place: a remediation plan and a redevelopment plan. The remediation plan must be approved by the state environmental agency pursuant to a response program contained in CERCLA. As a result, the remediation plan will apply to those sites that are enrolled in state voluntary cleanup plans and are entitled to the liability protections provided by the 2002 Brownfields legislation. The redevelopment plan must be approved by the state development agency and demonstrate how the redevelopment will be beneficial to the state and local economy, as well as the local community. The state is to establish an allocation plan that lists the selection criteria to determine the priorities in providing the credits. 
   The plan shall include the following preferences: 
   Extent of poverty; Whether site is located in an enterprise zone or renewal community; Whether the site is located in the central business district; Extent of environmental remediation; Extent of redevelopment; Extent of financial commitment to the redevelopment; Amount of new employment resulting from the redevelopment; Whether a past owner/polluter is expected to provide at least 25 percent of the remediation expenditures. 
   The state is able to impose other conditions, such as bonding or insurance policies that cover the cost of the environmental remediation. 
   The bill is supported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the International Council of Shopping Centers, Empower America, American Council of Engineering Companies and the National Association of Home Builders.

  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""debt hawk,"" voted early this morning against passage of S. Con. Res. 70, the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Resolution. His vote represents his opposition to Congress continuing to ignore America's dire fiscal problems by using smoke and mirrors to mask long-term challenges.
   ""Neither Republicans nor Democrats have offered a budget that even comes close to re-establishing our fiscal sanity,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The Democrats actually increase the national debt by $2 trillion over five years, which increases the debt owed by every American child by $27,000. We must stop this charade once and for all. Both sides of the aisle have a clear, moral obligation to improve the fiscal health of our nation. And it starts with formulating a fair and honest budget."" 
   The Budget Resolution voted on in the Senate today uses egregious tricks to give the appearance of a responsible budget by:
   * Allowing for unlimited emergency spending, although a great deal of the spending that is currently designated as ""emergency"" is actually quite regular and predictable; 
   * Allowing for a dramatic increase in entitlement spending through the use of more than 37 reserve funds that are not included in the overall budget totals; 
   * Hiding increases in discretionary spending through the use of seven Cap Adjustments - appropriations for seven favored programs and agencies will not count toward the budget limit as if they don't even exist; 
   * Claiming that at least $300 billion in revenue will be collected from ""closing the tax gap,"" or collecting more of the taxes that are currently owed but not paid. The fact is, this is much more difficult than they make it sound. These taxes should be collected, but if it was as easy as the Democrats make it sound, we would have found the money to fix the AMT years ago; 
   * Settling, yet again, for no entitlement reform and instead growing entitlement spending by $488 billion over five years; and 
   * After a decade of Democrats calling for 10-year budgets because five-year budgets hide our long-term problems, Democrats are now settling for a five-year budget that continues to cover up the gathering fiscal storm looming on our horizon. 
   ""Experts say the most important step you can take is to first admit you have a problem. Well, we've got a big problem. Let's finally admit it and fix it,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The question now is, do we have the moral courage to fix it - or, are we too interested in protecting our political hides to do anything?"" 
   Fiscal Reality Check-Startling Statistics:
   * As Baby Boomers begin to retire just over nine months from now, we face a long-term fiscal imbalance of $53 trillion. That translates into $456,000 of future government debt for every American household - or $175,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States. 
   * Forty years ago, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid accounted for 3.5 percent of GDP. Today, they're up to 9 percent. In another 40 years, they'll be up to 18 percent - equal to total federal revenues and crowding out all other spending. 
   * Since 1999, the national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $9.4 trillion today - an increase of more than 68 percent in just eight years. This amounts to $31,000 of debt for every American. 53 percent of the privately owned national debt is held by foreign creditors, including the Chinese government. That is up from 40 percent just five years ago. 
   * These numbers - which represent our past behavior - pale in comparison with the budget problems looming in our future as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire this year.

  ""EPA's analysis confirms that S. 2191 has the potential to seriously disrupt the U.S. economy, while doing little to address global climate change. The analysis predicts that by 2030, losses in gross domestic product (GDP) could be as high as $983 billion. By 2050, those losses could grow as high as $2.8 trillion. What is not explicit in the analysis, however, is that it assumes aggressive growth in nuclear power and other forms of clean energy, including clean coal, at rates that are widely regarded as unachievable for both practical and political reasons.
  ""As EPA's analysis demonstrates, under more constrained assumptions associated with the expansion of these clean energy technologies, the economic costs could be devastating - rising as high as $2.5 trillion by 2030 and $5 trillion by 2050, with electricity rates doubling over the same time period. 
  ""If we want to solve this global problem without seriously disrupting our economy and moving jobs overseas, we've got to get serious about moving forward with clean energy technologies, including clean coal and nuclear power.""
  EPA's Key Findings: 
  * EPA's analysis revealed the Lieberman-Warner bill could potentially cost $191 billion in lost GDP within the next 6 and half years. 
  * EPA's modeling shows a potential 44 percent increase in electricity prices by 2030 caused by the bill. 
  * The U.S. economy will take nearly a trillion dollar hit by 2030.

   SEN. VOINOVICH INTRODUCING SECOND BILL TO EASE FORECLOSURE CRISIS
   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), who last spring introduced the Mortgage Relief Act to help those suffering from foreclosure, today is introducing the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007 - legislation which will allow Americans facing foreclosure or resetting interest rates to refinance without the usual burdens associated with a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. The bill will also increase homeownership opportunities for millions of American first-time home buyers. The House version of this bill passed overwhelmingly last year by a vote a 415-7.

   The Expanding American Homeownership (EAH) Act will enable FHA to help those facing foreclosure to refinance for lower rates while helping millions of more low- and moderate-income families to buy a first home. Many of these borrowers currently must pay subprime rates because FHA lacks the ability to offer an affordable financing option. The companion bill in the House was written by Rep. July Biggert (R-IL) and has nearly 20 cosponsors including Ohio Reps. Steve LaTourette and Deborah Pryce. The late Rep. Paul Gillmor of Ohio was also a cosponsor.
   FHA was created in 1934 to give homebuyers access to reasonably priced mortgages under fair terms. Since then, it has been able to help more than 34 million families become homeowners. This legislation will modernize FHA and offer Americans a variety of safe homeownership options at a fair price.

FHA's existing down payment requirement does not meet the demands of today's marketplace, where most first-time homebuyers put down 3 percent or less. The ""new"" FHA will offer a variety of down payment options.
   2) Create a new, risk-based insurance premium structure for FHA that would match the premium amount with the credit profile of the borrower. It would replace the current structure, in which there is standard premium amount for all borrowers, while still protecting the soundness of its Insurance Fund. FHA would have the flexibility to charge a lower premium for low-risk borrowers, and to charge higher-risk borrowers a slightly higher premium.
   3) Increase and simplify FHA's loan limits. FHA's loan limit in high-cost areas would rise from 87 to 100 percent of the GSE conforming loan limit and in lower-cost areas from 48 to 65 percent of the conforming loan limit.

   The E.A.H. Act is the second component in Sen. Voinovich's legislative strategy to assist struggling homeowners in avoiding foreclosure. The first component addresses the tax consequences of debt forgiveness.
   Declining home prices and rising foreclosure rates have forced more and more families - often minorities, the elderly and immigrants - to sell their homes for less than they paid for them, and sometimes for less than the outstanding debt. Others have worked out a deal with their lenders where part of their mortgage debt has been forgiven. The Internal Revenue Service currently taxes any loan forgiveness as ""income.""
   That's why Sen. Voinovich introduced the Mortgage Relief Act of 2007 in May - legislation which will relieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the mortgage on a principal residence. The Mortgage Relief Act passed the House in October 386-27 but has yet to be voted on in the Senate.
   ""Clearly it is unfair to tax people on income that doesn't exist,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This is particularly true at a time when they have experienced a substantial economic loss on the most significant asset they own and have no way to pay the tax. This tax is unfair and must end immediately.""

It passed by a vote of 72 to 19. Commonly known as the Byrd Amendment, CDSOA assists American companies who have been unfairly harmed by foreign competitors who illegally dump low-cost goods in the Unites States, making it more difficult for American companies to compete. The Act, which has diverted more than $1 billion to U.S. manufacturers who have been negatively affected by this practice, has helped numerous Ohio companies.  
   ""In our fast-paced global marketplace, it is vital what we understand that American companies are no longer competing only against each other. They are competing against the world. The dumping of below-cost goods from abroad into the United States puts Ohio companies, especially Ohio's manufacturers, at an unfair disadvantage in the global marketplace. I commend Senator DeWine for his strong support of this important program and for leading the fight to keep it alive. If we are going to maintain America's edge in this global environment, we cannot shut the world out-but we also have to make sure that American manufacturers are competing on a level playing field with their competitors abroad,"" said Voinovich 
   The motion to instruct conferees was filed by U.S. Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH), a strong supporter of the Act and original co-sponsor in 1999. CDSOA, which has strong bi-partisan support, is a vital tool for protecting U.S. companies and their employees from being injured by unfair trade practices.

VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON DFAS TRANSFORMATION PLAN FOR CLEVELAND, COLUMBUS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) released the following statement today on the release of the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) final transformation plan for Cleveland and Columbus:  
   ""This is a great day for Ohio! The final decision of the BRAC Commission to keep two of Ohio's DFAS sites open is an outstanding victory for our state. Not only will the facilities remain open, they will also gain jobs--500 in Cleveland and up to 800 in Columbus. Our victory speaks to the high quality of our DFAS employees, the Ohio community and the power of the Ohio delegation. This is an example of what can happen when you galvanize all of the resources in the community through a public-private partnership. 
   I am very excited for the future of DFAS in Cleveland and Columbus. Both sites will become Centers of Excellence. DFAS Cleveland will be a Center of Excellence for Retired and Annuitant Pay Garnishments. It will gain several functions and will be covering Vendor Pay, Navy and Marine Corps Pay, Navy Accounting, Disbursing, and Civilian Pay. Not only will Cleveland retain the jobs it has now--but there will be 500 new jobs coming to Cleveland as a result of the decisions made by the BRAC Commission and the DFAS agency. These will be high-paying accounting and other jobs--a great boost for the Cleveland community, which has been suffering from unemployment. 
   DFAS Columbus at the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) will become a Center of Excellence for Acquisition Accounting including Contract Pay. It will cover Vendor Pay, Air Force Accounting, Accounting for Defense Agencies, Disbursing, and other functions. There will be up to 800 new jobs coming to Columbus as a result of these decisions. 
   The transformation of DFAS will begin soon and the BRAC implementation is expected to be completed in 2009. Through my capacity as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, I will follow the transformation carefully and will stay in close touch with DFAS Director Zack Gaddy on various personnel and workforce issues that are very important when a transformation on this scale takes place. 
   Again, I applaud all of the people here and in Ohio for this celebratory day.""

VOINOVICH SUPPORTS RESOLUTION CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) is an original cosponsor of a resolution introduced today condemning the harmful, destructive and anti-Semitic remarks made yesterday by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and demanding an apology for those statements of hate and animosity toward all Jewish and civilized peoples of the world.  
   ""President Ahmadinejad's shocking and disgusting statements are lies and need to be recognized as such. There is a movement underway in the world to deny the Holocaust and there has been an undeniable rise in hate and anti-Semitism, including in the Middle East. It is critical that we take every action possible to stop it and let all international leaders spreading the hate know that their lies will not stand. We are waging the battle not only to protect the Jewish people--although the safety of any one group is intrinsic to the safety of all--but also because we want to ensure that we do not again sink into barbarity. We will win this struggle. This resolution is another step in that direction, and it is critical to promoting tolerance and countering messages of hate,"" said Voinovich. 
   The resolution condemns the recent statement by President Ahmadinejad that denied the occurrence of the Holocaust and supported moving the State of Israel to Europe. It also demands an official apology for the damaging, anti-Semitic statements that ignore history, human suffering, and the loss of life during the Holocaust, condemns the government of Iran, and supports efforts to condemn the leaders of the Iranian government in all appropriate forums. Finally, the resolution supports efforts by the people of Iran to exercise self-determination of the form of government in their country and supports a national referendum in Iran with oversight by international observers and monitors to certify the integrity and fairness of the referendum. 
   This is just the most recent effort by Senator Voinovich in combating anti-Semitism. As a member of the Helsinki Commission during the 107th Congress, Voinovich helped raise awareness of the disturbing rise of anti-Semitism in Europe by participating in annual meetings of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, which is the largest regional security organization in the world, with 55 participating states from Europe, Central Asia and North America. Voinovich was instrumental in efforts to encourage U.S. support for an OSCE conference on anti-Semitism, which took place in Vienna in June 2003. 
   In October 2004, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 (S. 2292)--legislation authored by Voinovich--and sent the bill to the President for his signature. The bill requires the State Department to submit a report to Congress on global anti-Semitism in November 2004. Additionally, the legislation requires the State Department to enhance its reporting on anti-Semitism in two existing annual reports, the International Religious Freedom Report and the Human Rights Report. The bill passed with an amendment offered by Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Congressman Tom Lantos, which requires the State Department to create a new office to monitor and combat anti-Semitism. 
   Most recently, Senator Voinovich was an original cosponsor of a resolution urging action by the United Nations (U.N.) to curb the anti-Semitic bias of some U.N. member states. The resolution coincided with the U.N. World Summit being held in New York.

DEWINE, VOINOVICH SUPPORT BILL TO AWARD CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO JUDGE MOTLEY
  Sens. Mike DeWine (R-OH) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) have co-sponsored S. 2235, which calls on Congress to posthumously award a Congressional Gold Medal to Judge Constance Baker Motley. Judge Motley was the first African-American woman appointed to the federal judiciary and the first African-American woman to serve as Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York, the largest federal trial bench in the country. Before becoming a judge, she was a renowned civil rights lawyer and public servant, and was steadfastly committed to social justice. 
   ""Through one of the most contentious times in U.S. history, Constance Baker Motley's intelligence and determination helped protect for all Americans their rights promised in the Constitution,"" said Senator DeWine. ""We should remember the impact that Constance Baker Motley has had on generations of Americans by awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal. Her memory and achievements will serve as an inspiration for years to come.""  
   ""For nearly 40 years, Judge Constance Baker Motley served her country with honor and distinction. Through her eminent career at the forefront of the civil rights movement, she advocated constructive social change and worked to safeguard the rights of all people. Her commitment to justice stands as a sterling example of the impact one person can have on society, and she should be recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal for her lifetime of significant achievements,"" said Senator Voinovich. 
   Judge Motley's parents immigrated to America from the Caribbean Island of Nevis. After graduating from high school, she took a position with the National Youth Administration. Philanthropist Clarence Blakelee was so impressed by Motley's intelligence and oration that he offered to finance her college education. Judge Motley graduated from New York University in 1943. In 1946, she received her law degree from Columbia University. 
   Judge Motley joined Thurgood Marshall on the legal staff of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund when she was a senior at Columbia Law School. After graduation, she became the NAACP's principal trial attorney. For two decades, Judge Motley worked closely with Marshall and other leading civil rights lawyers to dismantle segregation throughout the country. She was the only female attorney on the legal team that won Brown v. Board of Education. She went on to argue 10 major civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, winning all but one of them, including James Meredith's fight to gain admission to the University of Mississippi. 
   After nearly 20 years with the NAACP, Judge Motley became the first African-American woman elected to the New York State Senate. In February of 1965, she became the first woman elected by the Manhattan members of the New York City Council to serve as President of the Borough of Manhattan. During this time, Judge Motley worked tirelessly to revitalize the inner city and improve urban housing and public schools. 
   Also in the early 1960s, she successfully argued for 1,000 school children to be reinstated in Birmingham, Ala., after the local school board expelled them for demonstrating. She represented ""Freedom Riders"" who rode buses to test the Supreme Court's 1960 ruling prohibiting segregation in interstate transportation. During this time, she represented Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as well, defending his right to march in Birmingham and Albany, GA. 
   When President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Judge Motley to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1966, she became the first African-American woman appointed to the federal judiciary. When Judge Motley became Chief Judge on June 1, 1982, she was the first woman and the first African-American woman to serve as such for the Southern District of New York, the largest federal trial bench in the country. She served as Chief Judge until October 1, 1986, when she assumed senior status. She served with distinction for nearly four decades, until she passed away on September 28, 2005. 
   Congressional Gold Medals are reserved for individuals worthy of the highest level of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions, particularly in the area of civil rights. Judge Motley's life exemplifies such criteria, and she should be honored in the same way as other great leaders, including Rosa Parks (1999), Dr. Dorothy Height (2003), and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King (2004). 
   The bill, which will posthumously award a Congressional Gold Medal to the late Judge Constance Baker Motley, was introduced on February 1, 2006, in recognition of the start of Black History Month.

VOINOVICH SECURES OVER $500,000 FOR LOW-FLOOR BUSES IN AKRON
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $505,178 grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the Metro Regional Transit Authority in Akron. The grant monies will be used to purchase two replacement 40-foot low-floor buses.  
   ""These new low-floor buses are a great advancement for public transportation, as they will ease the boarding process for everyone, especially for passengers with disabilities, who will no longer have to depend on a wheelchair lift to use the bus,"" said Voinovich. ""Public transportation plays a vital role in the city's infrastructure. It allows those who cannot drive to conduct their daily business, and it gives everyone a transportation alternative, which plays a key role in easing the congestion of city traffic."" 
   Low-floor buses have many advantages over regular buses, including faster boarding for the majority of passengers, as well as elimination of the traditional wheelchair lift which has posed a substantial maintenance burden for operators. Also, passengers who have difficulty climbing the stairs of a regular bus will find the low-floor buses, which can be lowered to within one foot of the road surface, much easier to board.

It works to improve cooperation with key allies while strengthening U.S. national security interests and promoting U.S. economic competitiveness. 
  ""This legislation will improve both our national security and economic interests while helping to solidify relationships and improve good will toward the United States for years to come,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""I will work closely with the administration and my colleagues in the Senate as we move forward to show our allies that we appreciate their help in this historic fight.""
   The second amendment, the Homeland Security Management Act of 2007, will elevate the roles and responsibilities of the current Undersecretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security for Management. The new position will oversee the challenges associated with creating a unified identity for the 22 federal agencies and 180,000 employees that make up DHS. 
  ""I am convinced the existing management structure at the department is insufficient and is hampering its ability to be successful,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Through this legislation, the creation of a Deputy Secretary for Management will provide essential expertise necessary for improving the long-term efficiency and effectiveness of the department."".

VOINOVICH, OBAMA SECURE OFFSET FUNDING TO HELP PROTECT GREAT LAKES FROM INVASIVE SPECIES
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) successfully included an amendment in the final Supplemental Appropriations Conference Report to provide $400,000 to keep the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal demonstration barrier operating through the end of Fiscal Year 2006. The funding is offset from existing Army Corps of Engineers dollars and will not add to the deficit. The conference report passed the Senate today by a vote of 98 to 1. It now goes to the president for his signature. 
   The demonstration barrier in the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal was authorized in 1996 under the National Invasive Species Act to prevent non-native species like the Asian carp from moving between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. Since this barrier was designed to be temporary and is close to the end of its expected service life, a second permanent barrier is being constructed. The Army Corps of Engineers indicated that they would be forced to shut down the demonstration barrier without additional funding - putting the region's $4.1 billion sport and commercial fishing industry at great risk.  
   The funding provided by this amendment will keep the demonstration barrier in operation through FY2006, maintaining the protection of the Great Lakes and providing the Corps with the necessary time to ensure that the permanent barrier is fully tested and up and running. Senators Mike DeWine (R-OH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mark Dayton (D-MN), Carl Levin (D-MI) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) co-sponsored the amendment. 
   ""The inclusion of this amendment in the final supplemental is wonderful news for the future of the Great Lakes,"" said Sen. Voinovich. ""This amendment builds on our work in 2004 to fund construction of the permanent barrier. I was shocked when I learned that Asian carp could have unfettered access to this national treasure - especially when so many dedicated people are working tirelessly to restore it. I am very pleased that we were able to join together and fix this serious oversight."" 
   ""If these barriers were turned off and Asian carp were allowed to enter the Great Lakes, they could quickly destroy the native species and forever change the lakes' ecosystems,"" said Sen. Obama. ""This funding will ensure that the efforts of so many people will not have been in vain. I am very pleased that we were able to work together to help preserve one of our most treasured natural resources."" 
   ""The barrier at the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal is an innovative solution to the on-going invasive species problem threatening the health of the Great Lakes--one of the largest surface freshwater systems in the world,"" said Sen. DeWine. ""Invasive species have cost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to Great Lakes fishermen, boaters, manufacturers and shippers. We need to shut the door to all of the pathways that these species can use to enter the Great Lakes. Funding to operate the barrier at the Chicago Canal is a key part of that plan."" 
   ""I commend my colleagues for working together to secure these funds in time,"" said Sen. Durbin. ""The carp approaching the northern section of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan have no natural predators and threaten both the native fish and natural wildlife of the lake, and, in turn, the economy of the entire Great Lakes region. The $400,000 approved this week will ensure that this critical barrier remains in operation, and that we avert a potentially devastating situation."" Asian carp threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem because they quickly consume large quantities of phytoplankton, which is critical to the stability of the ecosystem. Originally, they were introduced to the United States as a management tool for aqua culture farms and sewage treatment facilities. The carp have made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River. Asian carp can grow to an average of four feet and 60 pounds and can consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton per day.

  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) helped secure $503 million for the Army's M1 tank program in the final Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. The M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) tanks, which are produced and tested at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (formerly the Lima Tank Plant), received $300 million in the final conference report. Funding for the M1A1 Abrams Integrated Management (AIM) Program was restored to $103 million and the M1A1 Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK) Program received $100 million in funding. The conference report passed the Senate today and now will be sent to the president for his signature.  
   Pressure to reduce spending led the Department of Defense to reduce its original funding request for the tanks. As a result, the request was below the requirement and below the amount needed to sustain operations at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (JSMC) in Lima. Senator Voinovich worked actively with his colleagues to urge the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and the Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) to restore the funding and address the military's true requirements. 
   ""There is nothing more important than ensuring American soldiers fighting the War on Terror have the right weapons and protection,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The M1A2 SEP tanks are critical to our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The tanks and armor provide vital protection and weaponry to our men and women in the field. The restoration of this funding will help to ensure that our brave warfighters will have what they need to accomplish their mission and come home safely. It will also ensure that Lima has the funding needed to sustain production at the plant, secure important jobs, and continue its contribution to the safety and success of our military.""

  On Friday, June 15, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $300 million for the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program - funding that was requested by Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 
   The EMPG program is considered the backbone of the nation's all-hazards emergency management system and is the only source of federal assistance to state and local governments for emergency management capacity building. EMPG funds are used for personnel, planning, training and exercises at both the state and local levels. They support state and local emergency management personnel who are responsible for writing plans, conducting training, exercises, corrective action and educating the public on disaster readiness.

With the enhanced responsibilities and the tight budget constraints currently facing our state and local governments, the flexibility provided by the EMPG program is vital. Not fully supporting our first responders and emergency managers is unconscionable.""
   Last year the EMPG program was funded at $200 million. In his continued efforts to strengthen national preparedness and response capabilities, Sen. Voinovich this year submitted a letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security requesting $58 million in additional funding for the EMPG program. The letter was co-signed by 39 senators. Ultimately, Sen. Voinovich was able to secure an additional $100 million for the program over last year's allocation through continued lobbying efforts.

VOINOVICH COMMENTS ON ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF NATIONAL SECURITY PERSONNEL SYSTEM
  SPEECH: Opening Remarks for HSGAC Subcommittee Hearing
  A CRITICAL MISSION: ENSURING THE SUCCESS OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY PERSONNEL SYSTEM
   Today, this Subcommittee convenes a hearing entitled ""A Critical Mission: Ensuring the Success of the National Security Personnel System.""  
   The purpose of this hearing is to examine the proposed regulations for the National Security Personnel System and to continue the dialogue over its design. 
   When thinking about the Department of Defense, we often visualize the over two million active duty and reserve men and women of the armed forces. We are grateful to them for their heroic service to our country. 
   But we must not forget that working alongside them are approximately 650,000 civilians, who can be found working across the globe in support of our military. 
   These hard working and dedicated individuals, including the 20,000 in my home state of Ohio, understand that the work they do every day is instrumental to our national security. What responsibility could be more important than that? 
   In April 2003, the Department of Defense presented to Congress a proposal for new personnel flexibilities. In essence, Defense sought similar and additional authorities to what was authorized for the Department of Homeland Security to develop a system that is able to respond to current and future workforce and mission needs. 
   Through the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Congress granted the Department the authority to design the National Security Personnel System, or NSPS. 
   The proposed regulations for NSPS were published in the Federal Register on Monday, February 14. The proposed regulations have a 30 day public comment period; it closes tomorrow. Next, the Department of Defense is required by law to enter into a ""meet and confer"" process with its employee organizations that must last a minimum of 30 days. I understand that the process leading up to publication of the proposed regulations was not always smooth. I encourage both sides to make the most of this process to have a constructive dialogue on what is needed for the new system. 
   As with the Department of Homeland Security, I know many employees and their union representatives at the Department of Defense are concerned about the content of the proposal and the subsequent implementation of NSPS. 
   Several Defense employees in Ohio will transition into NSPS in ""Spiral One-point-One."" Many of my constituents have taken the time to phone or to e-mail me. They are uncertain what changes they will see and are unsure where to go to find answers. 
   For example, a woman who works for DFAS Columbus shared these thoughts with me in an e-mail: 
   ""I understand that pay raises will be based on the discretion of your supervisor. This causes me great concern as we have supervisors in our office who cannot take the time to do quarterly appraisals and awards, let alone write appraisals to give them a raise. Also, we have asked management many questions about NSPS and it appears that nothing has really been settled because they are unable to answer our questions."" 
   To the Administration, I say it is your obligation to continue an open dialogue and maintain a collaborative process with your employees as you refine the proposed regulations for NSPS. 
   It seems to be the consensus of outside observers that the labor-management collaboration process at DoD was not as open as the process at DHS, and I would invite all of today's witnesses to share their thoughts on this point. 
   The Defense Department must recognize that while the new personnel system is intended to assist it in responding to its national security mission, it also must provide employees the tools and structure to encourage, support, and reward them. 
   Defense leaders must recognize that despite the Department's experience with alternative personnel systems the changes put forth in NSPS are new for the majority of the employees at the Department and that it will take time to gain understanding. 
   The regulations impact the most fundamental concerns of any employee: Will my contributions be recognized? What are my opportunities for advancement and promotion? How will I be paid? What recourse do I have if unfairly treated? 
   Employees must see and recognize that they have a valued role in the shaping of NSPS. 
   To employee organizations, it is your duty to roll up your sleeves and work with the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management. It is not enough to say you do not like the system. I ask you to offer constructive suggestions to improve the proposed regulations. 
   I am here to assure you that I am committed to ensuring its success. 
   The NSPS regulations are not yet finalized. The publication of proposed regulations is only one of many milestones leading up to full implementation NSPS. 
   I know there are many interested parties that have suggestions for improvement. 
   I am certain the Comptroller General, who I am pleased to welcome back before this Subcommittee today, has some thoughtful observations. 
   At times I have had my own concerns with aspects of NSPS. 
   For example, I learned about this time last year that the department was rushing to implement the system by October 2004. I thought that was simply unrealistic. 
   I was so concerned that I went over to the Pentagon on March 30, 2004, and met with Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, Secretary of the Navy England, and Principal Deputy Undersecretary Abell, who I am pleased is with us here today. 
   I conveyed to them my concerns that the Department was proceeding much too rapidly, and that the massive change envisioned by NSPS would take years to properly implement. 
   I was pleased to learn that they agreed, and that after a hasty start, implementation was to proceed with much greater deliberation. Secretary England was given a lead role in implementing NSPS, and I had the chance to meet with him yesterday to discuss his progress. For the sake of continuity and in recognition of his efforts, I am pleased he is committed to leading the initial implementation of NSPS. 
   I suspect there is room for improving the regulations and in the days ahead I will make my own recommendations. 
   For example, there are differences between the final regulations for the Department of Homeland Security and the proposed regulations for the Department of Defense in areas such as labor participation. I am interested to learn why DoD has chosen a different path in some instances. 
   I am certain my colleagues here today have similar observations and suggestions. 
   And I know the witnesses here today representing employees of the Department have their own concerns and suggestions for improvement. I look forward to discussing these regulations and their responses with them.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES BILL TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS FROM TAX PENALTY
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), along with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), today introduced the Mortgage Relief Act - legislation to change current law that forces individuals to pay income tax when they have part of their mortgage loan forgiven or are forced to foreclose because of inability to pay their mortgage.  
  ""Removing this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This tax actually penalizes those who are trying to work it out in a responsible manner.""
  Declining home prices and rising foreclosure rates have forced more and more families - often minorities, the elderly and immigrants - to sell their homes for less than they paid for them, and sometimes for less than the outstanding debt. The Internal Revenue Service currently taxes any loan forgiveness as ""income."" The Mortgage Relief Act will relieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the mortgage on a principal residence.
  ""Clearly it is unfair to tax people on income that doesn't exist,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This is particularly true at a time when they have experienced a substantial economic loss on the most significant asset they own and have no way to pay the tax. This tax is unfair and must end immediately.""
  Nationwide, 2006 foreclosure rates were higher than any of the last 13 years. As a state, Ohio has the highest foreclosure rate in the nation at 3.38 percent (compared with the 1.19 percent national average). 2006 Ohio foreclosure filings increased by 24 percent over 2005, with over 79,000 foreclosure filings. Thirty-two counties had an increase in foreclosure filings above 24 percent, including eight major metropolitan counties: Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton, Lucas, Mahoning, Montgomery, Stark and Summit.

  According to new analysis from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), energy costs for consumers and employers will be even more expensive - and burdens on hard-working Americans, the elderly and the poor will be even more severe - if Congress adopts carbon mandates but fails to enact policies to increase domestic energy supplies.
   - According to new analysis from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), energy costs for consumers and employers will be even more expensive - and burdens on hard-working Americans, the elderly and the poor will be even more severe - if Congress adopts carbon mandates but fails to enact policies to increase domestic energy supplies.  
  In response to a request from Senators George V. Voinovich (R-OH), John Barrasso (R-WY) and James Inhofe (R-OK) sent in mid-September, EIA found that cap-and-trade legislation, without new nuclear power plants and rapid deployment of biomass and clean coal technology, will cause huge increases in electricity and natural gas prices.
   ""The energy supply crisis in the United States is sending jobs to China, destroying our manufacturing communities and forcing consumers to pay even higher energy bills,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""If we pass cap-and-trade legislation without increasing energy supplies, our country could face an economic catastrophe, and what's left of our good-paying jobs could vanish.""
   In July of this year, EIA analyzed S. 280, the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 and found that the bill - which was introduced by Senator Lieberman - would have devastating economic consequences if enacted. Notably, S. 280 is less stringent than the Lieberman bill now being considered by the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. 
   EIA's analysis of S. 280 includes many assumptions, including a substantial increase in nuclear power generation. EIA assumed about 150 new nuclear plants (approximately 150,000 megawatts) will be added within 30 years - a figure the nuclear industry would readily admit is a political and practical impossibility because:
   * There has not been a new order to build a nuclear plant in the United States in the last 30 years; 
   * There is no manufacturing infrastructure nor enough skilled workers to build and operate about 150 new nuclear plants within 30 years; and 
   * The nuclear industry has pointed out it will be difficult to even build 30 new nuclear plants in that time period. 
   EIA also assumes an increase in biomass generation and the development of carbon and capture sequestration technology that - due to political, regulatory and financial obstacles - will be extremely difficult to achieve. Even under those optimistic assumptions, the overall costs of the bill would be staggering. 
   By employing more realistic assumptions, EIA found that ""restricting the use of multiple low- or no-emission electricity generation technologies increases the use of natural gas for power generation and raises natural gas prices, electricity prices and CO2 permit prices."" 
   FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ALTERNATIVE CASES EXAMINED:
   * Higher natural gas use means natural gas prices are 41 to 53 percent higher in 2030 than business as usual projections. 
   * Electricity prices in 2030 are between 34 to 40 percent higher than business as usual projections. 
   ""These scenarios paint a much more realistic picture of the supply situation we face in this country, as well as the impact cap-and-trade would have on our economy,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Unless Congress acts to increase domestic supplies of natural gas and nuclear power, these numbers show that consumers - particularly the poor - will endure severe economic hardship.""
   Sen. Voinovich believes we should pursue policies that both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also make energy affordable for all Americans. That can only be done through advancing technology and increasing energy supplies. 
   The senators also requested that EIA model impacts beyond 2030. While EIA is currently unable to process this request, estimating the costs of climate change legislation beyond 2030 is extremely important, as the costs of a mandatory program are likely to be greatest after that point. For example, in testimony before the EPW Committee last week, Dr. Anne Smith of Charles River Associates International said the Lieberman bill would cause welfare losses of $4 to $7 trillion between 2010 and 2050.
   Sen. Voinovich notes that EIA's analysis of the costs of cap-and-trade legislation reinforces the need for comprehensive analysis of the Lieberman bill before it advances to the full committee and the Senate floor. 
   ""How can we vote on this bill unless we know how much it will cost American consumers, what the impact will be on American jobs and what burdens it could impose on the elderly and poor?"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""If we are serious about passing climate change legislation, then we ought to have all the facts before us.""

Individual Assistance includes grants for temporary housing, repairs to damaged homes, and other serious disaster-related expenses, as well as low-interest loans to businesses not fully compensated by insurance. The state has also been granted funding for hazard mitigation projects to prevent or reduce long-term risk to life and property from future natural or technological disasters.

VOINOVICH, JULY 16
  MESSAGE FROM SENATOR VOINOVICH 
   Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. Communicating with my constituents has always been a top priority for me, and I look forward to regularly updating you on the work I'm doing to help Ohio and the nation. It has recently been very busy in Washington, but I have had several opportunities to return to Ohio to work on a wide range of issues. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to visit my Web site at http://voinovich.senate.gov. And please share this e-newsletter with your friends and family by forwarding it to their email!
   PROTECTING THE GREAT LAKES  
   Recently, Sen. Voinovich participated in a special briefing on proposed federal and state efforts to stop destructive exotic species from entering and threatening Lake Erie and the Great Lakes. Sen. Voinovich has a long history of support for the Great Lakes. In 1967, when he was elected to the state legislature with Lake Erie forming the northern border of his district, he saw firsthand the effects of pollution on the lake and the surrounding region. In response, he committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the lake and waging what he calls the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" - his effort to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lake. In January 2007 he was named co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. The bipartisan group, part of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, seeks to protect the environmental and economic health of the Great Lakes region. 
  More than 180 invasive species of algae, fish, invertebrates and plants have become established in the Great Lakes. Once these destructive pests get a toehold, it is virtually impossible to limit their expansion. They quickly spread and out-compete native wildlife for food and habitat. Invasive species can kill fish and other native species and saddle state and local governments with multi-million dollar control and clean-up efforts. The only effective solution is preventing the future introduction of any new invasive species. 
  WORKING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE 
   Sen. Voinovich has long-believed that America's infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient oversight and funding. The tragic collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota made clear that the deterioration of our nation's infrastructure systems are impacting the overall welfare of the American people in addition to the economy and the environment. Sen. Voinovich, along with Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE), introduced the bi-partisan National Infrastructure Improvement Act in 2006 and reintroduced it again in March 2007. This legislation was, coincidentally, passed out of his Environment and Public Works Committee just two days before the Minnesota tragedy and then unanimously passed by the full Senate two days after. The bill gets to the heart of the infrastructure crisis by establishing a commission that will provide concrete recommendations for current and future infrastructure needs. This is an incredibly important and long-overdue first step towards restoring our nation's highways, waterways and infrastructure systems as well as protecting Americans and the economy.
  FIGHTING FOR VETERANS 
   Sen. Voinovich, a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, recently hosted a roundtable discussion in Cleveland with national and state veterans' organizations and representatives from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Government Accountability Office. The roundtable focused on the backlog of veterans' disability claims in Ohio. A longtime advocate for responsible management and government efficiency, Sen. Voinovich is also deeply committed to the needs of veterans. He is concerned about serious management challenges facing the VA and discussed the VA's regional field structure, its human capital management and ways to streamline the processing of disability claims. Sen. Voinovich is working with the VA to improve the guidance provided to veterans applying for benefits and to ensure claims by National Guard members are streamlined. He continues to work with GAO to identify ways to improve claims processing. This is just one example of how Sen. Voinovich is using his role in the Senate to help ensure we keep our promise to our veterans. 
   PRESIDENT HEEDING SEN. VOINOVICH'S CALL FOR TAX REFORM 
   President Bush recently called for reform of the tax code in direct response to a call of action from key lawmakers including Sen. Voinovich. Late last year, Sen. Voinovich sent a letter to the president, pledging his support of tax code reform and he is pleased to see the president shares his concerns.
   Sen. Voinovich, the Senate's top ""deficit hawk,"" and U.S. Representative Frank R. Wolf (R-VA) introduced landmark legislation earlier this year aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. Though the task is daunting, Sen. Voinovich is confident that simplifying the tax code and ensuring the solvency of our entitlement programs can - and should - be done, to ensure long-term prosperity and relieve future generations of unnecessary financial burdens.
  STATE FAIR TRADITIONS LIVE ON 
   For Sen. Voinovich and thousands of Ohioans, August means just one thing: the Ohio State Fair. Beyond the concourse of food and games and fair rides there lies a heritage that runs deep with a broad tradition celebrating all things good in Ohio. Sen. Voinovich has been an integral part of the fair since his days as governor of Ohio, traditionally being a guest conductor for the All Ohio State Fair Youth Choir and Band, and participating in the Heartland Cuisine Cooking demonstration in the Ohio Food Pavilion. In addition to meeting with local and state agricultural leaders, Sen. Voinovich spent two days at the fair this year with his wife Janet, and their children and grandchildren. In keeping with an annual tradition of spending a night in the barn, Sen. Voinovich and three of his granddaughters spent a night in the sheep barn with the High family from Richwood, Ohio.

VOINOVICH TO INTRODUCE LANDMARK TAX, ENTITLEMENT REFORM BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""deficit hawk"", on Tuesday, Jan. 16, will introduced landmark legislation aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. 
  The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced a similar bill in the House. 
  ""Last week I voted against the fiscally irresponsible repeal of the estate tax and called on Congress to heed Americans' demand for fundamental tax and entitlement reform. This legislation shows that I'm serious about that call,"" Sen. Voinovich said. 
  The reported deficit for FY2005 was $318 billion - and that's not taking into account the funds borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, which brings the total to nearly $500 billion. Even more, when utilizing the Department of Treasury's accrual accounting method, the deficit is a disturbing $760 billion. Also, the national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 1999 to $8.4 trillion today - an increase of 50 percent. Full repeal of the estate tax beginning in 2007 through 2016 would cost $368 billion according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
  ""As a fiscal conservative, I believe we must focus on simplifying the tax code and ensuring the solvency of our entitlement programs,"" Sen. Voinovich said.
  The Commission will be comprised of 15 voting members, three of which will be appointed by the president, three by the Senate Majority Leader, three by the Senate Minority Leader, three by the Speaker of the House and three by the House Minority Leader. The director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United States will be appointed as non?voting ex?officio members of the Commission to lend their expertise. The president will have the ability to appoint the chair from among the 15 voting members. 
  The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. A minimum of six public town hall meetings will be held throughout the country within one year to determine the scope of the problem and consider solutions. The Commission may consider all policy options, including:
  * Limiting the growth of entitlement spending to ensure that the programs are fiscally sustainable;
   * Strengthening the safety net functions of entitlement programs to provide assistance to the neediest;
   * Making the tax code more efficient and encouraging economic growth; and
   * Looking at ways to increase private savings. 
  ""America's fiscal situation is dire. Nothing is off the table when it comes to ensuring our long-term prosperity and increasing our competitiveness in the global marketplace,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Especially important is the tackling of fundamental tax reform. It could, by some estimates, save taxpayers over $265 billion just in costs associated with preparing their taxes alone. That would be a real tax reduction and it would not cost the Treasury a dime. It would be a tax cut that would guarantee people are paying no more than their fair share and would bring more money into the Federal Treasury.""
  At the conclusion of the town meetings, the Commission will present a report to Congress detailing the fiscal problems facing future generations as well as a framework of long-term solutions.
  Within 60 days of the presentation of their report to Congress, the Commission will transmit to Congress a legislative proposal designed to: 
   * Address the imbalance between long-term federal spending commitments and projected revenues; 
   * Increase net national savings to spur domestic investment and economic growth; and 
   * Improve the budget process to place greater emphasis on long?term fiscal issues.
  The administration and Congress will each have 60 days to review the proposal and develop equivalent proposals if they deem necessary. Any alternative from the administration or Congress would be considered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Congress will be required to vote on the proposals within a specified time period. The proposal with the greatest number of votes would be the Congressional body's preference going into conference.
  ""The task is daunting, but now is the time to act,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""I am thinking not only about the present, but about our children and grandchildren and the legacy - or burden - we will leave them."".

  Legislation that would provide $6.2 billion to Ohio over the next five years in federal highway funds passed the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee today. Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the EPW Committee, helped write the bill known as the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005.  
   ""A good highway system is critical for good jobs across our country and is one of the best ways to ensure our nation's economic security. This bill would help make our roads safer and improve our infrastructure, which are both critical to our just-in-time-delivery manufacturers,"" said Voinovich. ""This bill is long overdue, and I'm hopeful that the Senate will act on it soon. And as we move forward, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that Ohio's infrastructure needs are met."" 
   The current extension of the highway bill (TEA-21) will expire May 31, 2005. Senate passage of the bill, expected in April, would send it to a Joint House-Senate Conference Committee where the differences between the two bills would be reconciled. 
   For Ohio, the bill provides: 
   * $6.2 billion over five years, a 28.98 percent increase over the 1998 highway authorization bill, known as TEA-21.
   * Increases Ohio's rate of return from 90.5 to 92 cents of every gas tax dollar collected in Ohio and sent to Washington. 
   * When Voinovich took office as governor in 1991, Ohio received back 79 cents. 
   * He lobbied Congress hard and helped win changes in the 1991 highway bill, increasing this to 87 cents. 
   * He worked again to increase this amount to 90.5 percent in the 1998 highway bill. 
   Ohio Highway Facts: 
   * The nation's 10th largest highway network 
   * The 5th highest volume of traffic 
   * The 4th largest interstate highway network 
   * The 2nd largest inventory of bridges.

  An amendment sponsored by Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) that will require the Secretary of the Army to conduct a study of the feasibility, costs and benefits of supplying a second source of tires for the Stryker combat vehicle has been included in the final version of the 2006 Defense Authorization Bill. The amendment passed the Senate on November 9 by unanimous consent. The Voinovich amendment was cosponsored by Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH). The 2006 Defense Authorization Bill passed the Senate today by the unanimous vote of 98 to 0.  
   ""It is vital that our war-fighters have the equipment they need in the right place at the right time. With only one company currently supplying tires for our military's vital Stryker combat vehicle, there is no room for error. We must ensure that the supply chain will not be broken, especially in times of crisis at home,"" said Voinovich. 
   Currently, tires for the Stryker are solely supplied by Michelin. Prior to the war in Iraq, the Army maintained an eight month supply of tires for its wheeled combat vehicles. However, that supply was soon depleted. Michelin had to shift production to focus almost entirely on the needs of the Army. Before the conflict the Army only accounted for 10 percent of their production. 
   The establishment of a second supplier would help ensure that tires would always be available when needed. If it is determined by the report that a second supplier is needed, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company would be a natural domestic source for procurement.. The development of a domestic tire supplier would be beneficial to national security. 
   The report will include: 1. An analysis of the capacity of the industrial base in the United States to meet requirements for a second source for the production and supply of tires for the Stryker combat vehicle; and 2. Recommendations on means, over the short-term and the long-term, to address that inadequacy of the industrial base in the United States, to the extent that it is not adequate to meet requirements.

   The conferees directed that within 60 days of enactment, NASA shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations and the legislative committees of jurisdiction in the House and Senate a plan for how it intends to allocate aeronautics research funds for fiscal year 2006. Included in this plan should be a definition of work that enhances United States competitiveness.

VOINOVICH SECURES $500,000 FOR BOWLING GREEN STATE UNIVERSITY
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today announced that the 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations Conference Report includes $500,000 for the Bowling Green State University (BGSU) Lake Erie Water Quality Monitoring program. The report passed today by a vote of 94-5.  
   ""The restoration and protection of Lake Erie and all of the Great Lakes is one of my top priorities in the Senate. After a historic rebirth following reports of its 'death,' Lake Erie faces new challenges of toxic algal blooms and the reemergence of oxygen-depleted dead zones that often lead to massive fish kills. I am pleased to have been able to help secure this funding so that the researchers at Bowling Green will be able to continue their important work on monitoring and improving Lake Erie's water quality,"" said Voinovich. 
   As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Voinovich conducted a hearing in August 2002 in Cleveland on the recurring dead zone in the central basin of Lake Erie. Hypoxia (low-oxygen areas in bodies of water) has been steadily increasing in Lake Erie since 1995 and is threatening the Lake's stability. 
   To increase funding for the research of dead zones in the Great Lakes, Senator Voinovich introduced legislation to reauthorize and expand the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998. This Act originally focused only on coastal marine waters, but his legislation expanded its focus to include the Great Lakes. Senator Voinovich's Great Lakes provisions were included in the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act of 2004 (Public Law No: 108-456), which was signed into law in December 2004. 
   Requested by Senator Voinovich and authorized by his legislation, this funding will allow BGSU, in conjunction with Heidelberg College, to use a LANDSAT satellite to produce images of the algal blooms. They are also working on developing a detector instrument, which will be able to perform continuous algal measurements (the current satellite technology only produces updated data and images every eight days). This research will allow for further advancements in combating these dead zones and helping restore Lake Erie and all of the Great Lakes.

VOINOVICH SUPPORTED INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS FUNDING INCLUDED IN FINAL COMMERCE, JUSTICE AND SCIENCE BILL
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) helped secure $950,000 in Law Enforcement Technology and Interoperability Grants for three Ohio projects in the 2006 Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Conference Report, which passed today with a vote of 95-4. These projects will work to improve interoperable communications between federal, state and local governments by strengthening federal leadership, providing grants, and enhancing outreach and guidance.  
   ""The recent tragedy of Hurricane Katrina made it painfully evident that our nation's first responders have an immediate need for advanced communications capabilities and the ability to transfer vital information instantaneously. In the 1990s, the state of Ohio began work to tackle this problem head on, and created the Multi-Agency Radio Communications System, known as ""MARCS."" It is a system of interoperable communications that covers all 88 counties and reaches 99 percent of the state. It is my hope that these funds will build on that success and ensure that all of Ohio's citizens are protected,"" said Senator Voinovich. 
   The three projects slated to receive funding are the Ohio State Highway Patrol's Advanced Law Enforcement Integrated Computing and Interoperable Vehicle Technology Program, the Cincinnati Police Department's Records Management System and the City of Toledo's Communications Infrastructure. 
   $500,000 for the Ohio State Highway Patrol's Advanced Law Enforcement Integrated Computing and Interoperable Vehicle Technology Program. These funds will help enable the Ohio State Highway Patrol to equip vehicles in their Central Ohio car fleet with technologies that would provide in-vehicle computing capabilities, including downloading capability. The field-based software reporting allows officers both to access and to report real-time data regarding crashes, traffic citations, and first responder information. 
   $150,000 for the Cincinnati Police Department's Records Management System. These funds will be used to implement a comprehensive Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System and a Records Management System (RMS). These systems are used to collect, store, retrieve, and analyze data for the purpose of more effectively addressing crime and its underlying causes through Community Oriented Policing. This technology will help the Cincinnati Police Department to meet both the Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Justice and the Collaborative Agreement issued by Judge Susan Dlott. 
   $300,000 for the City of Toledo's Communications Infrastructure. These funds will assist the City's Department of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in laying an underground fiber-optic link. The ICT is responsible for all aspects of electronic communications within city government. Currently, the City of Toledo is in the process of building an 802.11 wireless broadband network that is funded through the COPS MORE (2001) grant. The wireless network will expand the information and resources available to emergency service personnel responding to emergencies. The fiber-optic link is needed to maximize the coverage area by linking remote sites that will serve as hubs for the network.

  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and co-sponsor of the bipartisan Warner resolution, on Saturday, Feb. 17, made the following statement after voting to continue debating the House Iraq resolution: 
   ""As a co-sponsor of the bipartisan Warner resolution, I became one of only seven senators to sign a letter to Senate leaders vowing to get a real debate on the resolution that opposes the surge in troops while holding the Iraq government responsible for ending sectarian violence through a diplomatic solution.
   ""The resolution also supports the servicemen and women who are bravely fighting this war by stating: 'this resolution should not be interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in, or withdrawal of, the present level of forces ?'
   ""I am disappointed that the Democrat leadership continues to preclude the Senate from debating and amending the insufficient resolution sent over from the House. This denies the Senate from robustly debating other alternatives including the bipartisan Warner resolution. That's why I voted to continue debating the House resolution. 
   ""The Democrat leadership strategy is to avoid controversial procedures that split the their caucus regarding cutting off funding for the troops and capping the deployment of troops in Iraq . The Warner resolution represents a negotiated agreement that reflects a bipartisan approach to the war and deserves to be debated and voted upon. 
   ""This is the second piece of legislation this week that Democrat leaders have brought to the Senate floor straight from the House with no amendments or debate allowed. This is setting a dangerous precedent and frustrates the role that the Constitution envisions for the Senate.
   ""I will continue to back the minority's right to bring up amendments and participate in a real debate even if I don't agree with those amendments or their ideas. The American people want Congress to play a role in the way this war is being handled. The first step is to demand a better plan, and we owe the people more than the 10 lines in the House resolution. You can't even begin to address a real solution to a complex situation in 10 lines."".

  A resolution introduced by Sen. George V.

The resolution recalls Serbia's historic fight for democracy and its September 2000 ousting of then-President Slobodan Milosevic, and pledges American support of Serbia's commitment to democracy as they move toward Parliamentary elections on January 21, 2007. It is co-sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Chuck Hagel (R-NE).

""This resolution affirms that the U.S. Senate is proud of Serbia's struggle and we support Serbia's commitment to stay on this path, despite the many challenges they continue to face today. We are good friends and we will remain so as the people of Serbia continue their fight for a better future.""
  In the resolution, Sen. Voinovich commends Serbia's advance toward progressive hallmarks-the rule of law, a free-market economy, and human and minority rights-and underscores the nation's current efforts, citing President Boris Tadic's public commitment to integration with Euro-Atlantic institutions and Serbia's inclusion of Albanian parties in elections for the first time in fifteen years.
  ""A strong, stable, and democratic Serbia is critical to the future of the region,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The people of Serbia deserve American support through this critical stage of political maturity."" 
  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should have a strong relationship with Serbia as it pursues its goals of membership in the EU, cooperation with NATO, and increased defense and security cooperation with the Serbian government. It also calls on Serbia to continue its progress on judicial, defense, and civil rights reforms, and to fulfill its obligation to the International Criminal Tribunal by arresting and extraditing known war criminal Ratko Mladic-a crucial condition for its EU and NATO membership.
  After widespread street protests in September 2000, Milosevic conceded power to the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, a broad coalition of parties that claimed he committed fraud in the federal election.

   EXPANDING THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM  
   Sen. Voinovich recently held a roundtable with ethnic leaders in the Warren-Youngstown community to discuss the expansion of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). The VWP - established in 1986 to improve relations with U.S. allies and benefit the U.S. economy - permits nationals from selected countries to enter the United States for tourism or business without a visa for up to 90 days. Currently, 27 countries participate in the program, but the program hasn't been expanded since 1999. 
   Sen. Voinovich recently introduced an amendment, The Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007, which would expand the VWP to countries that support the United States in the Global War on Terror and are prepared to help keep terrorists from crossing our borders. This legislation will improve cooperation with key allies in the Global War on Terror while strengthening U.S. national security interests and promoting U.S. economic competitiveness. In addition, it will enable Americans' relatives living in foreign countries to more readily visit their families here in the United States.

   Agriculture is Ohio's number one industry, and Sen. Voinovich has long held a great appreciation for Ohio's farmers. He is committed to working as a federal partner to help safeguard Ohio's interests and support the backbone of Ohio's economy. Recently, Sen. Voinovich spoke at the Ohio Farm Bureau breakfast in Washington. He addressed some of the leading concerns in the agribusiness industry, including energy policy, infrastructure funding and the fiscal health of the nation. He also received the Friend of Farm Bureau award for his dedication to helping Ohio farmers. In addition, Senator Voinovich held his annual farm forum in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, with state farm leaders to discuss Ohio's agriculture industry. This annual event is an opportunity for the senator to listen to farmers' concerns about the challenges facing the agriculture industry and consider solutions they recommend to assist Ohio farmers. This year, the senator spoke about the need for a strong safety-net for farmers, more investment in energy independence and many other issues of concern.

   Recently, Sen. Voinovich joined his colleague Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, fellow co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, to kick off Great Lakes Day. The purpose of Great Lakes Day was to discuss the policy goals of the Great Lakes Task Force - which works to enhance environmental quality and economic development throughout the Great Lakes basin - and focus on finding ways to make the restoration and protection of the Great Lakes a national priority in Congress. Sen. Voinovich has been fighting what he calls the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" for 40 years, since his days in the Ohio legislature. He has co-authored legislation in the 110th Congress to help protect the Great Lakes from invasive species and aid in the restoration of the Great Lakes.

""Paul had a wonderful knack for being able to work with people to get things done. He led by example and his enthusiasm and dedication always made you want to be on his team. He left an indelible mark on the people he worked with which is a part of his wonderful, lasting legacy. While this small token will never truly show how much we appreciate him, I hope his family will have a sense of how much he was admired and will be missed by so many people."" 
   ""It was my pleasure working with Paul Gillmor for many years in the House,"" Sen. Brown said. ""It is only fitting that the post office in Tiffin should bear his name. Congressman Gillmor was a true public servant, and he will be sorely missed in Northwestern Ohio."" 
   Because of Rep. Gillmor's diligent and devoted service to his country, he truly deserves the honor of having the post office in Tiffin, Ohio, bear his name. Not far from his small home town of Old Fort, Tiffin was chosen in concurrence with the wishes of his wife, Karen Gillmor.

VOINOVICH, OCT. 17
  Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. Communicating with my constituents has always been a top priority for me, and I look forward to regularly updating you on the work I'm doing to help Ohio and the nation. It has recently been very busy in Washington, but I have had several opportunities to return to Ohio to work on a wide range of issues. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to visit my Web site at http://voinovich.senate.gov. And please share this e-newsletter with your friends and family by forwarding it to their email!
   FIGHTING FOR OHIO'S AUTO WORKERS  
   Sen. Voinovich has been meeting with auto industry leaders in Ohio to discuss the potential for catastrophic industry job losses if the costly and restrictive Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) provisions included in the Senate Energy Bill are implemented. Most recently, he visited the General Motors Lordstown Assembly Plant near Youngstown. Sen. Voinovich, Ranking Member on the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air, believes the CAFE standards are extreme, excessive and unattainable. They threaten to destroy the domestic auto industry and devastate the well-being of hardworking Ohioans and their families. They also undermine efforts in the private marketplace to make realistic, achievable and environmentally friendly fuel economy improvements. Since 2000, Ohio has lost more than 42,000 jobs in auto manufacturing. A United Auto Workers (UAW) analysis indicates the implementation of the CAFE standards would directly threaten the jobs of 17,000 American workers who currently assemble vehicles in the United States, plus an additional 50,000 workers who make parts for vehicles. Sen. Voinovich believes that a sound national energy policy must be forged from which the United States can become less reliant on foreign sources, but that it cannot and should not be done on the backs of the domestic auto industry. 
   ADVANCING THE MORTGAGE RELIEF ACT 
   Recently, Sen. Voinovich's Mortgage Relief Act - legislation to change current law that forces individuals to pay income tax when they have part of their mortgage loan forgiven or are forced to foreclose because of inability to pay their mortgage - overwhelmingly passed the House by a vote of 386-27. In response, Sen. Voinovich called on Senate leadership to rush the bill to the floor for speedy passage, saying that homeowners need relief and cannot wait any longer. Declining home prices and rising foreclosure rates have forced more and more families - often minorities, the elderly and immigrants - to sell their homes for less than they paid for them, and sometimes for less than the outstanding debt. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service taxes any loan forgiveness as ""income."" The Mortgage Relief Act will relieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the mortgage on a principal residence, whether as part of a work-out, a short sale or a foreclosure. Removing this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided. Nationwide, 2006 foreclosure rates were higher than any of the last 13 years. As a state, Ohio has the highest foreclosure rate in the nation at 3.6 percent (compared with the 1.4 percent national average). 2006 Ohio foreclosure filings increased by 24 percent over 2005, with over 79,000 foreclosure filings. The House bill has some differences when compared with Sen. Voinovich's version that will need to be addressed, and he is working with the White House and members of the House to move forward as quickly as possible. 
   PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND JOBS 
   Sen. Voinovich recognizes and understands the fierce competition of the global marketplace and the hazardous threat counterfeiting and piracy pose to the economy. With manufacturing under siege, energy and health care costs on the rise and a litigation tornado sweeping through America, the clarion call for powerful leadership is sounding - and Sen. Voinovich is answering the call. He has advanced an aggressive agenda that seeks to protect manufacturing from unfair competition and is working to level the playing field by enforcing trade laws and developing programs to protect Intellectual Property (IP) rights. Most recently, Sen. Voinovich joined Sen. Bayh of Indiana to reintroduce their bipartisan Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act (S. 522) - a bill that is designed to take a number of important actions including the establishment of an international task force of like-minded countries who value IP protection and enforcement - true IP partners - that will work with the United States to reduce the production and flow of counterfeit and pirated goods. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, counterfeiting costs U.S. businesses as much as $250 billion annually and 750,000 American jobs have been lost due to counterfeit merchandise. IP theft also poses a threat to the health and safety of American citizens: counterfeit drugs make up 10 percent of the pharmaceutical market, and $3 billion in phony auto parts are sold in the United States each year. Sen. Voinovich is committed to safeguarding the economic health of the nation by improving the management, coordination and effectiveness of domestic and international intellectual property enforcement. 
   HELPING ENSURE OHIO'S WATER PROJECTS 
   Last month, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) Conference Report passed the U.S. Senate. Sen. Voinovich - a conferee and member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee - fought hard and successfully authorized funding for numerous projects and provisions benefiting Ohio and the Great Lakes. This was the first WRDA bill to be passed by the Senate since 2000, when Sen. Voinovich was Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. Sen. Voinovich strongly believes national investment in water resources has not kept pace with the level of economic expansion in the United States. If the steep decline in federal investment persists, continued economic expansion and environmental improvements will be threatened. Sen. Voinovich called the passing of the WRDA Conference Report a big step forward in addressing the challenges faced by the nation and, more specifically, faced by many of Ohio's communities with regards to water quality. Sen. Voinovich has long been an advocate of better water infrastructure, and he has urged the president to sign this bill into law to get these vital projects funded.
   LEADING THE WAY FOR SAFE NUCLEAR POWER GROWTH 
   As Ranking Member of the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, Sen. Voinovich is committed to the safe and secure growth of nuclear power to help meet our nation's need for a clean, reliable, cost-effective and diverse energy supply. Recently, Sen. Voinovich hosted a roundtable on nuclear energy in Cleveland with area industry and community leaders. During the discussion, Sen. Voinovich shared his strategic plan to help spur new nuclear plant licensing and construction and talked about how Ohio-based businesses and communities can benefit from the resurgence of nuclear power both within the United States and abroad. He encouraged forming a partnership among Ohio-based nuclear plant component manufacturing businesses with key international nuclear vendors, under the leadership of the Ohio Department of Development, to look for business expansion opportunities that will create more high-tech manufacturing jobs in the state. Sen. Voinovich has long called for a Second Declaration of Independence from foreign sources of energy and he looks forward to discussing ways to further develop nuclear energy as one way to reach that goal. In addition to state outreach, Sen. Voinovich has been conducting strong oversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to make NRC's licensing process more efficient while ensuring that NRC has the resources and tools necessary to deal effectively with the pending surge in new license applications.

VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN RULING
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released the following statement in response to the United States Supreme Court ruling upholding the ban on partial birth abortions: 
  ""Today's ruling is one of the most significant of our time. I applaud this decision and hope it leads the way to a renewed respect for human life in our nation. When I was governor, Ohio passed the nation's first partial birth abortion ban. I was disappointed when a federal court struck down that ban. But I was very pleased to continue the fight for life when I came to the Senate. I worked with Senator DeWine to help craft legislation we believed would pass constitutional muster. Thank God we got the job done and the Supreme Court finally agreed. We've now eliminated for good a gruesome practice that is nothing less than infanticide. However, we cannot stop here. Those of us who consider ourselves pro-life need to understand that we also must create an environment that causes expecting mother to choose life and support them once they make that critical decision.""

  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, today announced that South Korea will sign the Memorandum of Understanding outlining the security requirements the country will meet as a condition of future entry into the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Today's action was made possible by last year's passage of Sen. Voinovich's reform of the VWP - the Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007 - that was signed into law by President Bush as part of the 9/11 bill. The signing of this memorandum will take place this afternoon. 
   The president will welcome President Lee Myung-bak of the Republic of Korea at Camp David today. The meeting is an important opportunity to consult with the new president on ways to continue to work together to advance shared values of freedom, security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. The two leaders will also discuss a wide range of common goals, including ratifying the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula through the Six-Party Talks, continuing our cooperation in aiding the new democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan and further strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance.
   Sen. Voinovich's statement on South Korea's VWP participation follows:
   ""I am delighted see South Korea moving forward towards participation in the Visa Waiver Program following the recent enactment of my Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007. The selection of South Korea for this program reflects the close security cooperation our two nations share. Their future participation will have a positive impact upon American tourism, business and overall economic competitiveness and will further strengthen cultural ties between our two nations. I look forward to learning of additional nominations of our allies as they meet the necessary security criteria for participation. I am pleased the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State are exercising the new flexibilities provided by my legislation. Our nation can benefit both in terms of national security and economic stability when we work with our friends around the world.""

VOINOVICH'S MORTGAGE RELIEF ACT TO BECOME LAW
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich's (R-OH) Mortgage Relief Act - legislation to change current law that forces individuals to pay income tax when they have part of their mortgage loan forgiven or are forced to foreclose because of inability to pay their mortgage - today passed the House of Representatives and is on its way to the president's desk to be signed into law. 
  ""This is truly great news, because many homeowners are suffering and cannot wait any longer,"" said Sen. Voinovich, who, along with along Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) wrote and introduced this bill on May 15. ""This will be a much-needed Christmas gift for many Ohioans."" 
  Sen. Voinovich's version of the bill was amended to win passage in both the House and the Senate and to win White House approval before Christmas. The major difference is that the bill is now temporary and expires at the end of 2009, but the relief will be available for the 2007 tax season. 
  Declining home prices and rising foreclosure rates have forced more and more families - often minorities, the elderly and immigrants - to sell their homes for less than they paid for them, and sometimes for less than the outstanding debt. The Internal Revenue Service currently taxes any loan forgiveness as ""income.""

  ""Removing this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This tax actually penalizes those who are trying to work it out in a responsible manner.""
  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association national foreclosure rates are at the highest rate ever- at 1.69 percent of mortgages in foreclosure. Ohio has the highest foreclosure rate in the nation at 3.7 percent. Another 7.4 percent of Ohio mortgages are past due, meaning that more than one in ten are either past due or in foreclosure. Thirty-two counties had an increase in foreclosure filings above 24 percent, including eight major metropolitan counties: Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton, Lucas, Mahoning, Montgomery, Stark and Summit. 
  ""Clearly it is unfair to tax people on income that doesn't exist,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This is particularly true at a time when they have experienced a substantial economic loss on the most significant asset they own and have no way to pay the tax. This tax is unfair and must end immediately.""

I'm puzzled why so many of my colleagues do not recognize this fact or deliberately respond to the forceful lobbying efforts that insist if we do not provide additional federal resources for embryonic stem cell research, we are not striving to cure life-threatening diseases. Unfortunately, many of the individuals who support embryonic stem cell research have been kept in the dark about the advances of umbilical and adult stem cell treatments.  
   ""While embryonic cells have never been successfully used to treat even one disease, to date, adult stem cells have been used to treat 72 diseases such as breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord injuries and many others. I am gravely concerned about the possible implications of spending taxpayer dollars on embryonic stem cell research that divides Americans on moral and ethical grounds. I believe it is my moral responsibility to direct the federal government's dollars toward the areas of research that have the greatest near-term potential to help the largest number of Americans. I applaud President Bush for recently sending Congress the message that he will veto any bill that destroys life in the guise of research."" 
   ** STEM CELL UPDATE ** 
   U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) 
   As the debate over federal funding for stem cell research continues - a number of votes will most likely take place in the Senate on Tuesday, July 18 - I grow increasingly concerned that too many Americans are unaware that many of the most promising advances in medical research and treatment today are not attributed to embryonic stem cells. Rather, a great deal of the progress in the area of stem cell treatment and research is a result of the non-controversial, non-life ending use of adult and umbilical blood cord cells. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to provide an update on the progress scientists have made through the use of non-embryonic stem cells. 
   First, embryonic stems cells, as their name suggests, are derived from human embryos developed from eggs that have been fertilized in an in vitro fertilization clinic. Removing stem cells from these embryos destroys their potential life, making their use very controversial and something I cannot morally support. 
   On the other hand, adult stem cells are unspecialized cells found among specialized cells in mature tissues or organs. These cells can be gathered by scientist without any harm to the individual. Also included in this ethical category of stem cells are those from umbilical cord blood derived from the placenta of a newborn baby. Once considered medical waste and discarded after birth, science has determined that cord blood has the potential to save thousands of lives. 
   To date, adult stem cells have been used to treat 70 diseases such as breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord injuries and many others. For example, a group of physicians have been able to reconstruct the bladders of seven patients with advanced bladder disease with the individual patients' own progenitor cells. Another group of researchers, who discovered the benefit of adult stem cells in the repairing the heart, have treated 10 patients with their own bone marrow adult stem cells along with bypass surgery with extremely positive results. 
   In addition, I am further encouraged by recent reports from our nation's scientists about the potential of obtaining embryonic-like stem cells without creating or harming human life. 
   Some of the most exciting advances in the past several months include: 
   The American Journal of Pathology reported that a group of scientists recently isolated a novel population of multipotent adult stem cells from human hair follicles which, like embryonic stem cells, express neural crest and neuron stem cell markers as well as the embryonic stem cell transcription factors; 
   A study included in the April issue of Stem Cells and Development suggests that human stem cells derived from bone marrow are predisposed to develop into a variety of nerve cell types. This could lead to adult stem cell-based therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; and 
   According to Nursing Home & Elder Business Week, umbilical cord blood stem cells can develop into cells that are very similar to lung cells. In the past, these cells have helped cure cystic fibrosis in some mouse models. 
   What too many Ohioans do not realize is that a great deal of promising research on adult and umbilical cord stem cells is happening right here in our state at Cleveland's National Center for Regenerative Medicine. A partnership between Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals of Cleveland, the Center was established in 2003 to develop new adult stem cell therapies for patients suffering from chronic and debilitating diseases. 
   Currently, the Center has 10 on-going or planned clinic trials to further explore the use of stem cell therapies to reduce the risk of chemotherapy, treat certain heart conditions and improve umbilical stem cell treatment for leukemia. I recently had the privilege to hear two young Ohioans' discuss the successful adult stem cell treatment they received at the Center for an aggressive form of leukemia and severely broken bone that would not heal with traditional treatment. 
   I have the greatest sympathy for patients and their families who continue to struggle with a wide range of painful and, sometimes, life-ending diseases. Yet, too often I fear, proponents of embryonic stem cell research provide those suffering and their loved ones with false or unproven promises of hope in terms of embryonic stem cells while ignoring the real and substantial progress that has been made with adult and blood cord treatments. 
   I am gravely concerned about the possible implications of spending taxpayer dollars on an issue like embryonic stem cell research that divides Americans on moral and ethical grounds. I believe it is my moral responsibility to direct the federal government's dollars toward the areas of research that have the greatest near-term potential to help the largest number of Americans. In the current budget environment in which limited resources are available for federal medical research, I have concerns that increasing funding for embryonic stem cell research will take away opportunities for research in areas like adult and umbilical research - or even for research or treatment for specific diseases like cancer, juvenile diabetes or Parkinson's disease - that have proven their usefulness. 
   Consequently, and in light of all the advances and results science has provided with adult and umbilical blood cord stem cells, I urge my colleagues to continue to direct federal funding towards the non-controversial and proven areas of adult and umbilical cord blood stem cell research. And I applaud President Bush for recently sending Congress the message that he will veto any bill that destroys life in the guise of research.

  The U.S. Senate passed by Unanimous Consent Senate Resolution 533, written by Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) and cosponsored by Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), that commemorates the 60th anniversary of the permanent racial integration of professional football by four pioneering players: William ""Bill"" K. Willis, Marion Motley, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode. This integration, a full year before Jackie Robinson's much-celebrated integration of professional baseball, supported other ongoing efforts to permanently end racial segregation as an accepted practice in the United States. Sen. George Allen (R-VA) is also a cosponsor. The resolution gained the support of all 100 senators. 
   ""My colleagues and I have commemorated an important part of the civil rights movement by recognizing the groundbreaking accomplishments of these great men,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The integration of major professional sports dealt a blow to segregation across the country, causing other racial barriers to fall. The players deserve to be recognized not only for their outstanding contributions on the field but for the vital roles they played in history.""  
   ""These players showed courage and leadership as the broke down racial barriers and became role models for children and football fans of all races,"" said Senator DeWine. ""I am proud that two of these players were Cleveland Browns and helped show the country that sportsmanship and teamwork are what matter, not the color of one's skin."" 
   Thanks to the significant contributions of Bill Willis and Marion Motley, the Cleveland Browns won the National Football League (NFL) Championship in 1950, the first year the Browns played in the NFL. In addition to permanently ending the race barrier, Bill Willis and Marion Motley were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, recognizing their outstanding careers. 
   Willis is the only surviving member of the pioneering foursome. The NFL will commemorate him and the 60th anniversary of the permanent integration during the 2006 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on Sunday, August 6, 2006. Sen.

VOINOVICH RELEASES GAO REPORT SHOWING GOVERNMENT FAILING TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today released a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report showing the federal government is failing to properly protect America's intellectual property (IP) rights. 
  ""IP theft is a serious threat to our nation's economic and homeland security,"" said Sen. Voinovich, Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia. ""Every year U.S. companies lose roughly $250 million to pirated goods as well as 750,000 jobs to date. Even worse, these fake goods can be dangerous or even deadly to consumers.""
  As part of his commitment to protecting U.S. IP rights, Sen. Voinovich asked GAO to undertake this investigation to determine how effectively federal government law enforcement resources were being used to combat counterfeit and pirated goods. With the U.S. as the acknowledged leader in IP creation, Sen. Voinovich knows that protecting our IP rights is critical to the nation's continued prosperity as well as the safety of consumers.  
  GAO's report, titled ""Federal Enforcement Has Generally Increased but Assessing Performance Could Strengthen Law Enforcement Efforts"" (GAO-08-157), focuses on the effectiveness of several government IP enforcement efforts, including the inter-agency law enforcement coordination that is supposed to occur at the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (NIPRCC). GAO noted that improved inter-agency coordination was supposed to bring together the three primary IP law enforcement entities, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) in the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. 
  The purpose of the NIPRCC was to leverage resources and share information in the federal fight against counterfeiting and piracy. Unfortunately, GAO found the NIPRCC has not achieved its mission. While it was intended to collect, analyze and disseminate IP-related complaints from the private sector for investigation, the NIPRCC has focused primarily on educating the private sector about federal IP enforcement efforts. In fact, GAO found that FBI and CBP no longer appear to be allocating staff to the NIPRCC. 
  In addition to the problems identified with the NIPRCC, the GAO found mixed results that reveal a continued need to improve our nation's coordination efforts and focus on fighting counterfeiting and piracy. Specifically, GAO found that while law enforcement activities have generally increased since 2001, agency efforts to assess their achievements and improve upon the existing efforts of each law enforcement agency are limited. The GAO also noted that IP enforcement is frequently not an agency priority and is an issue that often receives fewer resources, making federal coordination all the more critical. 
  Despite a general increase in activity, IP enforcement still suffers from operational deficiencies. The findings of this report are consistent with what Sen. Voinovich has found during a number of oversight hearings and why he teamed with Senator Evan Bayh (D-ID) to introduce S. 522, Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act (IPREA). The IPREA would help to assure that IP received attention at the most senior levels of each department responsible for enforcement and by ensuring that the agencies charged with such enforcement receive the resources they need to stop these international criminals.
  ""In the fierce competition of the 21st-century global marketplace, intellectual property is one of the few areas where America has a clear advantage over foreign competitors. It is vital that we protect that advantage, level the playing field and ensure continued economic growth for Americans,"" Sen. Voinovich said.
  The strategy used by those who would steal intellectual property has evolved, and we must make sure that the government's response for combating intellectual property theft also evolves. The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act will increase cooperation among agencies in charge of IP investigations and add other agencies such as those that specialize in tracking terrorist financing, to the detriment of our national security interests. 
  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act would:
  Create one organized force to combat IP theft that would facilitate the sharing of information; 
  Establish formal processes for consulting with small and medium sized businesses, industry associations and other interested groups and to develop resources to assist such stakeholders in protecting their intellectual property; 
  Establish an international task force of foreign countries to track and identify IP criminals; 
  Encourage reliable trading partners to join the task force; and 
  Require a Strategic Plan to identify the objectives of the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act and the methods for achieving those objectives. 
  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act enjoys support from more than 35 organizations, including the: U.S. Chamber of Commerce; National Association of Manufacturers; Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association; The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; Precision Metalforming Association; National Electrical Manufacturers Association; Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition; Association of Equipment Manufacturers; Aerospace Industries Association; Electronic Industries Alliance; American Apparel & Footwear Association; Intellectual Property Owners Association; Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Products Association; American Electronics Association; Association for Competitive Technology; National Marine Manufacturers Association; Toy Industry Association; Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association; and Specialty Equipment Marketing Association. 
  Please see below for additional information on Sen. Voinovich's bill and additional facts on IP theft's cost to our nation. Also, for a copy of the GAO report, please contact the senator's press office. 
  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act
  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act treats intellectual property (IP) theft with the seriousness it demands, offering a focused, aggressive solution to stop domestic and international counterfeiting. The legislation would safeguard the economic health of the United States, preserve jobs and protect the health and safety of American citizens by increasing the coordination among agencies charged with IP protection and making permanent many of the president's current initiatives to combat IP theft. 
  The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act would:
  Create an Organized Force: 
  To create a more organized force, the legislation would establish an Intellectual Property Enforcement Network (IPEN) to replace the looser, interagency approach currently responsible for coordinating IP enforcement efforts. Under the proposed legislation, federal agencies would coordinate and share information to aid each other in identifying, tracking, arresting and prosecuting IP criminals. Additionally, formal mechanisms would be established for working with state and local law enforcement and the private sector, artists, entertainers, workers and the organizations that represent them.
  Increase Enforcement Team Oversight:
  In recognition of the role of Congress in the protection of IP, the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act requires that IP coordination and enforcement agencies work together to develop a strategic plan, and that appropriate metrics are developed to measure the success of these efforts. Congressional involvement is important to make certain that adequate resources are provided to address this major competitive issue.
  Strengthen International Enforcement:
  To encourage a global effort against IP theft, the legislation calls for the United States to begin setting high standards of enforcement with foreign governments, with the goal of establishing an international task force made up of like-minded countries to track, identify and stop IP thieves. The task force would be modeled on a similar international team that fights money laundering and other black-market crimes. The criteria for admission into the task force would include having effective laws preventing IP theft and demonstrating a track record of enforcing those laws. The President would be encouraged to make cooperation with the global task force a priority among U.S. trading partners.
  Develop a Strategic Plan:
  To bolster current efforts and provide needed direction, the White House and the President's coordinator would be responsible for drafting a strategic plan identifying the objectives of the IPEN, and the methodologies for achieving those objectives. Included would be a detailed explanation showing how relevant agencies are working together to identify, track, arrest and prosecute IP criminals. The strategic plan would also provide an explanation of the resources needed to accomplish the objectives and an estimation of the cost of those resources. Lastly, the strategic plan would detail performance measures to monitor results.

VOINOVICH APPLAUDS BUSH'S NEW COORDINATED GREAT LAKES RESTORATION EFFORT
  Sen. George Voinovich issued the following statement today in response to an executive order signed this morning by President Bush charging US EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt with working with state and local entities to coordinate the Administration's Great Lakes restoration efforts:  
   ""Restoring the Great Lakes could be the greatest legacy any of us leave on this earth. Making progress requires appointing an 'orchestra director' to bring together the work that's going on now in various agencies, but which currently lacks coordination. I've been pushing for this to be done for the past year. I've held hearings on it and written to the President on it and I applaud the President for taking this important step. EPA Administrator Leavitt is a good man who cares about getting the job done and I'm looking forward to working with him on this."" 
   Voinovich is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee which has jurisdiction over Great Lakes restoration. 
   The President's Executive Order calls for Leavitt to partner with state, local, tribal and other interests ""to address nationally significant environmental and natural resource issues involving the Great Lakes"" and ""to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship."" Leavitt will discuss the plan further at an event later today in Chicago. 
   In July 2003 Voinovich held a hearing in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, which he chairs, in which he criticized the lack of a single coordinator for Great Lakes restoration policies and activities. He followed this up with a field hearing of the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which is a member, in Cleveland in August to examine current and future efforts to restore and protect the Great Lakes. Following these hearings he wrote to President Bush in September 2003 urging him to move forward with a coordinated effort to restore the Great Lakes.

MARTINEZ, VOINOVICH INTRODUCE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE ALTERNATIVE
  U.S. Senators Mel Martinez (R-FL) and George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today joined with House Republican Leaders and several members to introduce a bill to reauthorize and expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The measure contains a full reauthorization of SCHIP, a $1,400 per child health care tax credit, and an aggressive outreach program to ensure all children eligible for the program have the opportunity to sign up for insurance. It also allows states to explore various efforts to reduce the number of uninsured and the cost of health care; improve quality and access to care and expand information technology.  
  ""This bill gets the job done. It insures 10 million children and does it in a way that preserves and protects the quality of health care for all on the program,"" said Martinez. ""As Republicans and Democrats, we need to move forward with viable alternatives - this bill will ensure the reauthorization of an SCHIP that covers the intended population and expands private health insurance coverage for families in need.""
  ""We all want to cover more uninsured children but we should not unnecessarily increase a government program beyond its intent when the private sector is already providing coverage,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Our nation already invests $2 trillion in health care each year - it's time to look at how we're currently spending this money. Our bill looks at the big picture and finds ways to increase funding for SCHIP while using the tax code to insure millions of children. It also recognizes that, while health reform proposals are bottled up here at the federal level, states are in a unique position to demonstrate ways to do the job better. Our bill gives states the ability to examine various strategies to reduce the uninsured, lower costs and improve quality of care.""
  It's estimated that between 500,000 and 1.5 million children are currently eligible for SCHIP coverage but are not enrolled simply because the families don't know the program exists. The bill encourages states to find innovative ways to identify and enroll that population.
  Introducing the House version of the bill are Representatives Marilyn Musgrave (CO-4), Tom Price (GA-6), Tom Feeney (FL-24) and Tim Walberg (MI-7). There are currently more than 40 cosponsors including Minority Leader John Boehner (OH), Republican Whip Roy Blunt (MO), and Deputy Republican Whip Eric Cantor (VA).
  Senate cosponsors include Senators Mel Martinez (FL), George Voinovich (OH), Jim DeMint (SC), Lindsey Graham (SC), John Cornyn (TX), John Thune (SD), Jeff Sessions (AL), Jim Inhofe (OK), and Saxby Chambliss (GA).

VOINOVICH-SPONSORED D.C. TUITION ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM PASSES SENATE
  Today, the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant (D.C. TAG) program, legislation U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) introduced in January, passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. The legislation will reauthorize the D.C. TAG program for five additional years. This program targets students living in the District of Columbia who have limited access to a state-supported education system, and provides assistance with the cost of attending college. Scholarships are used to pay the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition at state universities nationwide. Additionally, smaller grants are available to students attending private colleges in Virginia, Maryland and the District and Historically Black Colleges and Universities nationwide. 
   ""I believe that a world-class education is the best way to help our country's citizens make the most of their God-given talents,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""In today's world, it is also our best economic development tool and the best investment we can make in the future. It is vital that we do all we can to help the less-fortunate get the college education they deserve. This program has had a tremendously beneficial impact on promoting higher education for high school graduates and the funds must remain available for students in need. D.C. TAG enables us to help level the playing field for high school graduates in Washington, D.C., and enhance their educational opportunities.""
   Students are awarded up to $10,000 a year, with a cap of $50,000 for the duration of their education, to attend public colleges nationwide. In addition, District students receive $2,500 per student per school year, with a cumulative cap of $12,500 per student to attend private institutions in Maryland and Virginia, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities nationwide.
   Since the first grants were awarded in 2000, the program has dispersed over 26,000 grants, totaling over $141 million, to 9,769 District students. District high schools have seen a 60 percent increase in college attendance, with 75 percent of District students indicating that D.C. TAG has enabled them to choose a college that best suits their educational needs. Ohio has benefited from this program with 74 District students attending eleven Ohio colleges with over $500,000 in TAG funding.

VOINOVICH WORKING ON IRAQ COMPROMISE
  Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, today unveiled legislation he drafted to try and forge a bipartisan compromise on Iraq so we can move forward - with one voice - as a nation. 
   Sen. Voinovich's legislation would:
   * State that a precipitous withdrawal of forces would have dangerous consequences for U.S. national security; 
   * Make clear that we must remain engaged in Iraq for the foreseeable future;
   * Cite the recommendation of General Petraeus that a reduction of forces is imminent;
   * Call for the reduction to commence no later than 120 days after enactment, which would be consistent with the Petraeus recommendation;
   * Call for an increased role for the U.N. and other regional allies;
  Call for a transition of the mission to focus on specific areas that are critical to U.S. objectives;
   * Would not set an arbitrary deadline by Congress for the transition of mission - but would require the Administration, working in conjunction with the generals on the ground, to report back with a comprehensive plan for disengaging responsibly and increasing international cooperation to prevent instability. This would satisfy those who want a timeline for progress as well as those who disagree with a congressionally-mandated deadline on the commander-in-chief;
   * Require the Secretary of Defense to report back in 180 days with a proposed date for completing a transition and a plan for reducing instability in Iraq/the region as forces are reduced, which is consistent with Petraeus's report that he will not be capable of making a decision on future reductions until March.
   Also, see below for some questions and answers about the senator's bill: 
   Q: What is it that makes this proposal new? 
   A: The proposal is based on compromise between the Republican and Democratic positions on Iraq. It includes language from the Levin-Reed proposal, but addresses some serious issues of concern for Republicans, which have been proposed in Republican-sponsored resolutions. It can form the basis of a compromise that a majority can support for the immediate future, for the benefit of America and our national security.
   Q: How is this any different from the President's plan?
   A: It is legally binding, and not open-ended. It requires the President to commence troop reductions that General Petraeus recommends within 120 days and to come back to Congress within 180 days with a timeline for future reductions, based on a responsible plan for our national security. It gets away from a never-ending, open-ended commitment - because it legislates the next steps forward so that we can implement a responsible exit-strategy that will protect our national security interests.
   Q: How does it differ from Levin-Reed? 
   A: This resolution states clearly that we do not support a precipitous withdrawal, which could have dangerous consequences for our national security (massive violence, attacks on remaining troops and personnel, endangered oil and gas supplies, or regional war). While this was not the purpose behind Levin-Reed, it removes any doubt by stating that clearly. This is a real and legitimate concern for many Republicans and Democrats, who do not want to see the economy or region destabilized because of a hasty pull-out. The resolution calls for a ""responsible"" reduction of troops, and includes additional elements that the senator believes makes it clear that we need to do this responsibly.
   It adds some additional language that calls on the President to do more to get the international community involved, to share the responsibility and to prevent instability in Iraq. This will help us to reduce to a more limited presence in a responsible way.
   The resolution also states clearly that we must remain engaged in Iraq for a long time, which sends an important message from Congress to the world and the Iraqi people. They need to know that as we reduce our military presence within Iraq, we are not abandoning them, and we will plan to remain engaged in various ways for the foreseeable future.
   Like Levin-Reed, it calls for a transition to limit the mission of our forces in Iraq, but it is more flexible than the Levin-Reed language because it allows for cooperation on intelligence, support for Provisional Reconstruction Teams, and cooperation with Iraqi Security Forces who need to fight extremist militias that attack U.S. forces and innocent people (the same ones who get help from Iran). These are important areas of cooperation that are currently helping to reduce the violence and defeat al-Qaeda within Iraq.
   Lastly, and most importantly, it would not set an arbitrary deadline by Congress for the transition of mission - but would require the Administration, working in conjunction with the generals on the ground, to report back with a deadline. This approach would be a compromise between those who want a firm deadline and those who oppose the imposition of a congressionally-mandated deadline on the commander-in-chief.
   Q: This resolution proposes ""limited missions,"" but how are they limited? What are troops prevented from doing that they do now?
   A: They will not be prevented from doing several missions important to stability to Iraq - such as protecting U.S. forces, fighting al-Qaeda, conducting counterinsurgency operations, and training the Iraqi police and military. But the legislation would make it clear that it is not our mission to secure the entire country, or ""hold"" Iraqi territory, because this is the responsibility of Iraqis. 
   Right now, according the President's plan, one of our primary missions is to build security in Iraq by ""holding"" Iraqi territory once it has been cleared of terrorists or insurgents. That is a job that could go on forever and could put us in the middle of the country's internal power struggles and sectarian conflicts for a long time. We must continue to help Iraqis, but we need to continue with the Petraeus bottom up approach - giving that job to the Iraqi people and their own government. Therefore, we need to develop a plan to support the Iraqis holding their own territory, so that we can bring U.S. forces home. As forces return, the remaining forces should focus solely on the missions outlined in this resolution.
   Q: Why do you think it will attract Republicans or Democrats? Why would the President agree not to veto this bill?
   A: This is a bipartisan compromise, and we need a bipartisan approach if we are going to be successful as a nation. Republicans and Democrats understand that point. A little compromise can get us somewhere - but if both sides dig in our heels, we won't get anywhere. The President has outlined a plan that could be implemented within the terms of this resolution, but on a more firm timeline. He should agree to listen to the voice of many Americans and explore this avenue as a fair compromise so that we can move forward as a nation with one voice.
   Lastly, and most importantly, it would not set an arbitrary deadline by Congress for the transition of mission - but would require the Administration, working in conjunction with the generals on the ground, to report back with a deadline. This approach would be a compromise between those who want a firm deadline and those who oppose the imposition of a congressionally-mandated deadline on the commander-in-chief.

     Statement of Senator Barack Obama on International Human Rights Day Monday  December 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC    The following statement was submitted by U  S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  in the Congressional Record today on International Human Rights Day      Mr  President  today is Human Rights Day  Fifty nine years ago today  thanks in large measure to the tireless leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt  the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      The principles encompassed in the Declaration are uniquely rooted in the American tradition  beginning with our founding documents  Yet the Declaration also wove together a remarkable variety of political  religious  and cultural perspectives and traditions  The United States and the United Kingdom championed civil liberties  The French representative on the committee helped devise the structure of the Declaration  India added the prohibition on discrimination  China stressed the importance of family and reminded UN delegates that every right carried with it companion duties  Today should be a day of celebration  a day when we hail the universality of these core principles  which are both beacons to guide us and the foundations for building a more just and stable world        The Universal Declaration was a radical document in its time  and its passage required courageous leadership from political leaders  Even though no country could have been said to be in full compliance with its provisions  including the United States where Jim Crow still prevailed  all UN member states committed themselves to promoting  protecting  and respecting fundamental human rights  Although Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not live to see the enactment of the historic Declaration  it enshrined his    four freedoms       freedom from want  freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and freedom from fear  Individuals in the United States and everywhere else were entitled  simply by virtue of being human  to physical and economic security  The Declaration was born of the recognition  in the words of one human rights scholar  that    what is pain and humiliation for you is pain and humiliation for me           Anniversaries are a good time to examine how faithful we have been to our own aspirations     to ask ourselves how well we are measuring up  to assess whether our practice lives up to our promise  We in the United States enjoy tremendous freedoms  but we also carry a special responsibility     the responsibility of being the country so many people in the world look to  just as they did in Mrs  Roosevelt   s day  for human rights leadership        Today  on this anniversary  we must acknowledge both bad news and good news  The bad news is that for nearly seven years  President Bush has ignored Franklin Roosevelt s wise counsel about the corrosive effects of fear  Indeed  instead of urging us to reject fear  he has stoked false fear and undermined our values        Wounded by a horrific terrorist attack  we were warned that Saddam Hussein     a man who had nothing to do with that attack     could unleash mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs  We were told that waterboarding was effective  We were assured that shipping men off to countries that tortured was good for national security  We were led to believe that our military and civilian courts were inadequate  and so we established a network of unaccountable prisons  And the Administration launched secret wiretapping initiatives  scoffed at the rule of law  and flaunted the will of the Congress          Nonetheless  in his second inaugural  President Bush rightly proclaimed     America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one     But  tragically  he has failed to heed his own words   We have not only vacated the perch of moral leader  we have also compounded the threat we face  spurring more people to take up arms against us       The further bad news is that other countries have not stepped up to fill the void left by our lack of moral leadership  The hundreds of thousands killed and two million displaced by the genocide in Darfur  the shell shocked Buddhist monks in Burma  the political opposition in Zimbabwe  the imprisoned independent journalists in Russia  the brave human rights lawyers and judges in Pakistan     they do not know where to turn internationally  Human rights abusers win seats on the UN Human Rights Council  the International Criminal Court issues war crimes indictments  but no country steps up to enforce them  the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations begs in vain for troops  helicopters and police to help stave off humanitarian catastrophes  For all these reasons  the world needs renewed  principled U S  leadership       There is another critical reason why America must again provide moral leadership on human rights  the fate of women around the world  Whether it is in creating wealth  access to capital  and property rights  or receiving quality education  health care  and social services  women still lag far behind men   And of course the lack of full reproductive rights can be a matter of life and death for too many women  Inequality means insecurity for women  especially those who comprise 70 percent of the world   s poorest  There is a clear link between discrimination and violence against women  equality and empowerment of women is the most effective approach to ending violence against women  Today  violent acts against women  in the words of UNICEF     are the most pervasive violation of human rights in the world today           Women   s inequality and the persistent prevalence of honor killings  trafficking  repression  and sexual assault nearly six decades after the Universal Declaration shame us all  One need only look to Saudi Arabia  where a 19 year old woman  who was raped  instead of receiving treatment and support  was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for riding in a car with a non related male   In the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Darfur  rape is routinely used as a weapon of war by militia and government forces   In northern Uganda  young girls are given as    prizes    to older male soldiers to reward performance        In Pakistan  international observers report that one of the largest challenges facing its next election is guaranteeing women enough security so they can leave their homes to vote  In Iraq the militarization and rise of radical Islam has eroded women   s rights  In Afghanistan  while nothing can compare to the day when the Taliban ruled the entire country  women throughout that country complain that their freedoms have been woefully curtailed  The United States alone cannot solve the problem of women s suffering and gender inequality around the world  but with new  principled leadership  the United States can elevate women s economic  political and social development to the top of our international agenda and ensure that women around the world know that they have a reliable friend and partner in America      Let me close by saying that the very depth of the anti Americanism felt around the world today is a testament not to hatred but to disappointment  acute disappointment  The global public expects more from America  They expect our government to embody what they have seen in our people  industriousness  humanity  generosity  and a commitment to equality  We can become that country again                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be

      Obama  Green Applaud House Passage of Bill to Aid Homeless Veterans Thursday  July 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                          CONTACT  Samantha Burch  Green  or Michael Ortiz  Obama                          WASHINGTON  DC   The U S  House of Representatives today passed H R  3329  the Homes for Heroes Act  which will provide shelter for homeless veterans and their families and help prevent very low income veteran families from falling into homelessness   Rep  Al Green  TX 09  worked with Veterans  Affairs Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Michaud  ME 02  to introduce the Homes for Heroes Act in the House in August 2007   This afternoon  the White House issued a  Statement of Administration Policy  stating that the Davis Bacon Act s prevailing wage requirements included in the bill will make H R  3329 subject to a veto by the President    The bill was introduced in the U S  Senate by Sen  Barack Obama  D IL  in April 2007   Today  the House took an important step in honoring our military men and women by passing this critical legislation that will help eliminate homelessness and provide affordable housing opportunities for our nation s heroes   This is the least a grateful nation can do   Rep  Green said    As the House sponsor of the Homes for Heroes Act  I especially thank Senator Barack Obama for championing this bill in the Senate and commend my colleagues in the House for voting to provide those who have sacrificed for our country with the assistance they deserve  I urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto a bill that will ensure a brighter future for all of our veterans    Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country  and we must do everything we can to provide these heroes with housing and job opportunities when they return home   said Senator Obama    Unfortunately  far too many of these brave men and women are living on the streets  and that is unacceptable   I am proud to support this legislation  which will go a long way in meeting our commitment to our veterans   I commend Congressman Al Green for his leadership in moving this widely supported legislation through the House   I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this bill as soon as possible  and I call on the President to sign it into law   On any given night in this country  800 000 persons experience homelessness and  according to the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   nearly 200 000 of these homeless Americans are adult veterans who live on the streets  in shelters or in community based organizations   Nearly 400 000 veterans may experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year   Of these    47 percent of homeless veterans are Vietnam veterans Half have mental illness Two thirds suffer from alcohol or other substance abuse problems 56 percent of all homeless veterans are African American or Latino   This bill not only brings to light the plight of up to 400 000 homeless veterans  it brings them one step closer to being able to say they have achieved the American dream of a home to call their own   Providing our veterans with affordable housing and supportive services is the least we can do for those who fight for us   Rep  Michaud said  The Homes for Heroes Act will   Establish a  200 million assistance program for supportive housing and services for low income veterans  Expand the highly successful Department of Housing and Urban Development   Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  HUD VASH  Program  authorizing 20 000 vouchers annually and making the program permanent  Authorize  1 million in HUD grants to assist housing and service providers with the execution of their housing projects for veterans assisted by HUD  fulfilling the planning and application process  and assisting veterans in obtaining permanent housing or homeless assistance   Establish the position of Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within HUD to coordinate services to homeless veterans and serve as a liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs  state and local officials  and nonprofit service organizations  and Require HUD to submit a comprehensive annual report to Congress on the housing needs of homeless veterans and the steps HUD has taken under the programs provided for in the bill                                Pursuant to

Law  Thursday  July 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT     Brian Fallon  Schumer   Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  DOJ Has Not Consistently Enforced Federal Law Requiring Disclosure of Foreign Influences on U S  Policy Democratic Senators Urge Inspector General to Examine DOJ Decision Making Behind Enforcement of Lobbying Regulations Senators Have Also Proposed Bill To Close Loophole Exempting Lobbyists For Foreign Corporations From Reporting Requirements WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Barack Obama  D IL   today called on the internal watchdog at the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to investigate the agency s spotty enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   a federal law requiring disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign entities such as governments and political parties  The senators believe that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of FARA  allowing certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad  the senators said   Too many lobbyists are skirting the law and operating in the shadows  and in too many cases  the Justice Department is standing at the light switch  refusing to turn it on  We want answers   Schumer said   The public has a right to know when our government is being lobbied by foreign interests and the Department of Justice has a responsibility to uphold and enforce the law in all circumstances    In a place where we need more transparency  not less  lapses in enforcement of lobbying disclosure laws should not be taken lightly   McCaskill said   This is serious matter  and I expect the Inspector General to address it head on to assure the enforcers are truly enforcing the law    It is unacceptable that lobbyists can exploit loopholes to hide their lobbying contacts on behalf of foreign businesses and governments   said Senator Obama    The American people have a right to know who these individuals are representing and which American officials they re lobbying   Abusing the law to hide access and special treatment is exactly the kind of Washington culture that I ve been fighting against   I am proud to stand with Senators Schumer and McCaskill to close these loopholes  and I call on the Justice Department to immediately investigate this abuse of the law   The intent of FARA  passed by Congress in 1938  was to bring transparency to the work of lobbyists representing foreign clients by requiring the lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice  But in recent months  multiple cases have surfaced where lobbyists acting as foreign agents have either registered with the DOJ late or not at all  Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless   Senators Schumer  McCaskill and Obama today asked the DOJ Inspector General for a report on the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law  The Senators have also called on the Inspector General to take appropriate steps within the Department to look at the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General with suggestions as to how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  In June  Senators Schumer  McCaskill  and Obama unveiled legislation that would close two loopholes allowing U S  lobbyists to influence government officials on behalf of foreign clients without having to disclose their activities  The Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  would require all lobbyists representing foreign clients to register under FARA  even if they have already registered under Lobbying Disclosure Act  LDA   Under current law  lobbyists registered under LDA are exempt from also registering under the more rigorous FARA  The bill would also require that any lobbying contacts with U S  officials on behalf of foreign clients be disclosed even when they occur outside of the United States  Currently  the law only covers contacts that occur  within the United States    A copy of the Senators  letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine is below     July 9  2008 Mr  Glenn A  Fine  United States Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Mr  Fine  It has come to our attention that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA    We would like to know more about the decision making process behind FARA enforcement and whether or not enforcement has been uneven or lax over time   As you are well aware  FARA was passed in 1938 and requires disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign governments  individuals  political parties  and corporations   Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad   Recently  we introduced the Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  in order to close two loopholes in the law that allow certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  We believe that the requirements under FARA are clear and should be enforced in all circumstances   Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless  We know that you share our commitment to maintaining the public s trust in government   We believe that allowing individuals to break the law and operate in the dark on behalf of foreign entities will erode this trust we hold so dear   Therefore  we request an examination of the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law    We hope that you take appropriate steps within your Department to look into the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General or his appropriate subordinate with suggestions on how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  We also request that you transmit to us  and the appropriate congressional committees of jurisdiction  a report on your findings  We look forward to hearing from you on this matter     Charles E  Schumer    United States Senator                                                      Claire

                                  Durbin  Murray  Obama Introduce Bill to Update Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury for Military Thursday  May 10  2007   WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation  yesterday evening  to improve the care of veterans and service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries  TBI    The bipartisan Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act would establish a program within the Departments of Defense  DOD  and Veteran Affairs  VA  that would provide individualized services  improve coordination between the two agencies  require routine brain injury screening tests for military personnel  increase TBI patient benefits  improve case oversight and expand TBI research in the Defense Department and the VA      Too many of our brave service men and women are coming home from war with serious injuries that may be overlooked because they don   t bear any visible wounds or scars     Durbin said     We owe them the best treatment and support  while learning more about these injuries and their treatment   With that knowledge  we can moderate the impact TBI has on the lives of our veterans and their families       Last year  Senator Durbin introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that allocated an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007  That authorization was included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill this January  at Senator Durbin   s urging  That amendment as well as this bill has been endorsed by Veterans for America    Joining Durbin as cosponsors of the bill are Senators John Warner  R VA   Patty Murray  D WA   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Barack Obama  D IL   James Webb  D VA  and Maria Cantwell  D WA    Senator Patty Murray  D WA   an original cosponsor of the bill said    TBI has clearly emerged as the signature injury of the War in Iraq  Unfortunately  the response to treating and understanding it has lagged  leaving our veterans and their families searching for answers  This bill makes TBI research  benefits  and coordination top priorities at the DOD and VA  It also requires routine screening   a critical step toward ensuring that service members with TBI don   t slip through the cracks          Troubling recent reports have made clear that a high percentage of service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from mental health problems and traumatic brain injuries  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling through the cracks     said Senator Obama      As we prepare our nation to assist the generation of service members returning home from war  we must implement comprehensive reforms that provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those with traumatic brain injuries   Providing the best treatment for our service members is one thing about this war we can still get right     Durbin   s bill addresses the following issues  Standard of Care   The act will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Program  run by DOD and the VA  to provide treatment and rehabilitation to service members and veterans who have suffered a service connected traumatic brain injury   It will provide a clear standard ensuring that every service member and veteran suffering a traumatic brain injury will receive the services that best meet their individual needs   Screening   DOD will be required to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre test to be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and upon return from deployment to determine if possible brain injury exists   The act will also require DOD and the VA to conduct outreach to advise service members and veterans about the TBI Program  their rights and responsibilities  treatment and rehabilitation options and the availability of screening   Case Management and Health Care Services   Inefficiencies in case management as well as the complex nature of care required by TBI patients has led to patient and family confusion  contradictory guidance and treatment  and a number of instances in which patients did not receive proper care   This act directs DOD and the VA to assign each patient a lead case manager to ease the stress on patient and family  facilitate navigation through the DoD and VA systems  ensure adequate care is being provided  prevent duplication of efforts  and avoid contradictory guidance   Additionally  DOD and the VA must assign each patient a lead primary care physician to coordinate and oversee the care provided to the participant  including all treatment  rehabilitation  and medications   Overlap of Benefits   To ensure members receive the best care and rehabilitation available  all participants enrolled in the program shall  for the first two years  receive any of the benefits available to veterans and to active duty members  regardless of their active duty status   Patients    Rights     DOD and the VA must also make available an appeals process to challenge any failure to provide the standard of care required in the TBI Program  They must also provide a referral to a medical professional outside of the DOD and VA when requested by a TBI patient   Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war  The widespread use of improvised explosive devices  IED   s  has created thousands of TBI victims  sometimes with no other visible signs of injury  The concussions from IED explosion cause sudden  violent head movements which often lead to a TBI  With symptoms similar to that of shaken baby syndrome  TBI   s are difficult to diagnose  Injured service members may suffer from headaches  confusion  dizziness and lightheadedness in mild cases  to mood changes  loss of memory  convulsions  weakness or numbness in the extremities  and loss of coordination in more severe cases

  Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans Tuesday  April 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt Homes for Heroes Act would provide support to nation   s 200 000 veterans in need WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  was today joined by Senators Charles Schumer  D NY   Robert Menendez  D NJ   and Sherrod Brown  D OH  in introducing the Homes for Heroes Act  a bill that would expand housing and rental assistance for homeless veterans   The Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  estimates that approximately 200 000 adult veterans live on the streets or in shelters on any given day  and nearly twice as many are homeless at some point during the year       As we work to end the war in Iraq  we must also prepare to deal with the generation of service members returning home from war     said Senator Obama      As long as there are veterans or veteran family members searching for shelter on the streets  and as long as there are wounded service members receiving substandard medical care  we have failed in our duty to honor the commitment of the brave men and women who chose to serve   We must provide our returning heroes and their families with every resource they need to rebuild their lives          As we   ve seen at Walter Reed and elsewhere  our veterans returning from war have not received the help and resources they deserve     said Senator Schumer      The thousands of homeless veterans are just another stark example of how the Administration has let our veterans down  This bill will right this wrong by providing the men and women who have served our country with housing assistance   Too many veterans need a roof over their heads and it   s time we provide it now      Senator Robert Menendez said     A grateful nation should work to ensure that the men and women who risked their lives serving their country are not left stranded when they fall on hard times back home  Just as we have acted to improve health care for injured veterans  we should act to make sure veterans can put a roof over their heads          There are more than 2 000 homeless veterans in Ohio  They fought for us  We should fight for them  That s what this bill is about  and I am proud to support it     Senator Brown said   The    Homes for Heroes Act    will address these concerns by   I  Establishing Permanent Housing and Services for Low Income Veterans   Families The bill would expand the supply of permanent affordable housing for low income veteran families  This would not only provide shelter for homeless veteran families  but also help prevent low income families from falling into homelessness   The bill establishes a  225 million assistance program for community and nonprofit organizations to purchase  build or rehabilitate housing for low income veterans    The organizations would also coordinate with the VA and HUD to provide supportive services including substance abuse and mental health counseling  vocational and employment training  transportation  child care and other services to help veterans live independently   Tenants would pay a certain percentage of their income as rent   II  Expanding Rental Assistance The legislation would expand the highly successful HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  HUD VASH  Program  authorizing 20 000 vouchers annually and making the program permanent   The current authorization expires at the end of 2011 and only provides a small fraction of the vouchers needed to meet demand  currently  only 2 500 are authorized in FY 2011    This program provides permanent housing subsidies and case management services to homeless veterans with mental and addictive disorders   The VA and HUD coordinate to screen and provide services for recipients  III  Focusing Government Resources on Homeless Veterans The bill would establish the position of Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within the Department of Housing and Urban Development to coordinate services to homeless veterans and serve as a liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs  state and local officials and nonprofit service organizations  The bill also places additional priority on veterans by requiring all local public housing agencies to come up with plans to address the needs of homeless veterans as part of their five year comprehensive housing affordability strategy submitted to HUD    The bill also calls for comprehensive reports to Congress on the housing needs of homeless veterans and the steps the government is taking to address them   IV  Exclusion of Veterans Benefits from Rent Considerations The bill would prohibit benefits received by any member of a family from the VA from being included as income for the purposes of determining the amount of rent paid by a family for occupancy of a dwelling unit assisted under a federally assisted housing program  or in housing assisted under a federally assisted housing program  V  Assistance to Housing Service Providers The bill authorizes  1 million in grants for assistance to service providers during the application process and to assist with the execution of their projects  Senator Obama has also sponsored the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  S  713  and the Lane Evans Mental Health Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act  S  117  to reform medical treatment for soldiers and veterans                                    ,Obama

have introduced the Global Poverty Act  S 2433   which requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs   Representatives Adam Smith  D WA  and Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House in September       Eliminating global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges we face  with billions of people around the world forced to live on just dollars a day     said Senator Obama      We can     and must     make it a priority of our foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water   As we strive to rebuild America   s standing in the world  this legislation will not only commit to reducing global poverty  but will also demonstrate our promise and support to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy has to extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere        Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century     Senator Hagel said      This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world      America needs to do more to help the 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day by helping promote sustainable economic growth and development   said Senator Cantwell   We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries  The U S  needs to implement a real plan to combat poverty on a global scale while also addressing the national security risks extreme poverty creates      Arguably no greater problem faces the world than global poverty  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion people live on less than  1 a day   We have a moral obligation to craft an overall U S  strategy to decrease global poverty and eliminate extreme global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I was pleased to see it pass this year with overwhelming bipartisan support   This bill   s Senate introduction is a significant step toward it becoming law     Representative Adam Smith said  For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world   s poorest people   In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015   We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act  Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015  Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President   s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables   Requires the President to report back to Congress on progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy  This legislation is supported by a broad range of groups  including Bread for the World  CARE  Oxfam America  Habitat

         WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today wrote to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing his concerns about the growing number of systematic sexual assaults against women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago  Obama asked Secretary Rice to answer a series of questions about the situation in the DRC and what the United States government is doing to help curb this violence against women  In December of 2005  Obama introduced The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo  The legislation was signed into law on December 22  2006    Below is a copy of the letter  October 10  2007    The Honorable Condoleezza Rice   Secretary of State  Department of State  Washington  D C  20520   Dear Secretary Rice     I am writing to express my concern about the escalation of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago      The violence has been marked  in particular  by systematic sexual assaults against women   In 2004  Amnesty International estimated that at least 40 000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the DRC since 1998   In 2006  the United Nations reported 27 000 sexual assaults against women and girls in South Kivu province alone   Human Rights Watch has documented cases of rape victims as young as three years old   The New York Times recently reported that  in one town in the DRC  70 percent of Congolese women reported being sexually brutalized   The perpetrators     including disgruntled government soldiers  homegrown militia groups  and former Hutu militiamen who fled into Congo s forests after participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide     have sustained their armed conflicts by exploiting the country s natural resources  raiding villages and committing violent atrocities    The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which I introduced in December 2005 and which was signed into law by President Bush on December 22  2006  identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo   That law states  in part  that U S  policy shall be to     urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces  hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations  particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war  accountable and bring such individuals to justice        help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health  education  and psycho social support programs        work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  MONUC  to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards  promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions  and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo       In that regard  I ask that you provide responses to the following questions     1     Do you have reason to believe that any DRC armed forces have been involved in mass rapes in the eastern DRC during the recent violence      2     What mechanisms exist to investigate and report on allegations of such violence     3     What  if any  investigations have been undertaken  and what have been the results of such investigations      4     To date  have any individuals been held accountable for such violence     5     What is the nature of U S  support for efforts to build the new Congolese armed forces and what elements of that support  if any  raise awareness about the importance of this issue of sexual violence      6     Is any U S  support contingent on the DRC government taking steps to address this issue     7     What steps  if any  is the U S  taking diplomatically to develop a consensus position among all donors contributing to the rebuilding of the Congolese armed force about the importance of addressing sexual violence     8     What resources has the United States government dedicated to victims of sexual violence over the course of the last six years     9     How is the U S  ensuring that the UN  and all countries that contribute troops to MONUC  are abiding by codes of conduct for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking     I thank you in advance for the consideration of these questions  and I look forward to your prompt reply    Sincerely     Barack Obama   United States Senator                                  ,Obama

               Obama Calls for Investigation into Violations by Private Medicare Insurers Wednesday  October 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511  Requests additional oversight  answers from GAO   WASHINGTON  DC     Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to open an investigation into Medicare Advantage programs    Recent reports have exposed cases of private insurers exploiting America s seniors by denying access to needed health care services and medications  improperly denying claims  engaging in deceptive sales practices  and providing poor customer service    Below is the text of Senator Obama s letter    October 8  2007   The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office   441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548    Dear Mr  Walker    I am writing to request that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  immediately open an investigation into the exploitation of senior citizens by private insurers participating in the Medicare Advantage program     According to an analysis by the New York Times  tens of thousands of Medicare recipients have been the victims of deceptive sales practices by these private insurance companies  had claims improperly denied or denied without explanation  and received poor customer service in trying to get their questions answered   In some cases  the practices of these companies were found to have affected the health of patients by delaying access to urgently needed health care services and medications      Medicare has been a successful program for four decades  in part because it has been free of such practices   And if this is the price of introducing private insurers into the system  the cost for America and our senior citizens is too high    Among the examples of problems identified by these audits were    UnitedHealth and Humana denied claims without giving any explanation to beneficiaries   WellPoint had a backlog of 354 000 claims  its call center required an average of 27 minutes to answer phone calls from beneficiaries and 16 minutes to answer calls from providers  and more than half of the callers hung up without speaking to a customer service representative   Sierra Health Services stopped drug coverage for 2 300 beneficiaries with HIV AIDS when the company mistakenly thought that the beneficiaries had not paid their premiums   and  Humana had so many complaints about its marketing practices that it could not investigate all of them     Other news stories in recent months have detailed how insurance companies aggressively market private Medicare plans to seniors   in some cases even forging their signatures and providing false information   What is particularly egregious is that these private plans receive higher subsidies for services than under traditional Medicare   The Medicare Payment Admission Commission recently reported that on average the government pays 12 percent more to private Medicare plans than it costs to treat comparable beneficiaries through traditional Medicare   These excessive subsidies cost the government billions of dollars every year    Given the popularity of Medicare Advantage plans     enrollment has increased to 8 7 million from 5 3 million in 2003     it is important to ensure these companies are providing the services for which they are reimbursed   This year  the federal government will pay private insurers  76 3 billion for participating in the Medicare Advantage program   I am pleased that GAO has already started this oversight process as evidenced by a July 2007 report finding that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was not complying with a requirement that it audit the financial records of one third of participating companies      However  I believe that GAO needs to conduct additional oversight into how America  s senior citizens are treated by these private companies   Specifically  I believe that GAO should open an investigation into the following    The extent of deceptive practices in the marketing of Medicare Advantage programs   Whether beneficiaries are wrongly being denied needed health care services and medications   Whether the claims of beneficiaries are being improperly denied or denied without sufficient explanation  The speed with which appeals of claims denials are considered   Whether customer service representatives are responsive to the questions and concerns of beneficiaries  and  Whether additional safeguards are necessary to protect beneficiaries     Given the seriousness of this issue and its effect on America  s senior citizens  I appreciate your prompt attention to this request   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,Obama

Example of Cooperation on Noreiga   s  Extradition and Extradite Hans Peterson Immediately Tuesday  September 11  2007  For Immediate Release Contact   Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging her to consider  in light of the State Department   s support for France   s extradition request for Manuel Noriega  to publicly request that the Government of France extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago     In today   s letter  the Senators note that     The State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States  We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet          Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and reportedly confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson   s extradition     On August 23  France announced its decision not to extradite Peterson  While the extradition treaty between the United States and France says that there is    no obligation upon the requested state to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the requested state     this treaty does not preclude France from exercising its discretion to extradite one of its nationals to the U S       Last week  Durbin met with the newly appointed French Ambassador  Pierre Vimont  and the French Charg   d   Affaires  Fran  ois Rivasseau  to urge France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson   On August 27  Durbin and Senator Obama sent a letter to the French Foreign Minister  Bernard Kouchner  urging France to reconsider its decision    On August 20  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States    request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter on August 20 to Secretary of State Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case    text of the letter is below    September 11  2007 Dr  Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State  2201 C Street NW  Washington  DC 20520 Madam Secretary   We write to seek your urgent assistance with regard to the pending extradition request in the case of murdered Illinois doctor David Cornbleet   This letter follows up on our letter to you of August 20  to which we have not yet received a response   In light of the time  sensitive nature of this matter  we request that you respond to this letter as soon as possible and no later than one week from today      Dr  Cornbleet  a respected and beloved doctor from Chicago  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   In August 2007  Hans Peterson  an American citizen with dual French nationality  turned himself in to French authorities in the French West Indies and confessed to Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder  and we have contacted you and the French government to express our strong support for that request    However  the French government has said that France will not extradite Peterson  and that Peterson will be tried under the French justice system    We note that the State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States   We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet    We believe the specific facts of this case justify Peterson   s extradition to the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s murder was unspeakable in its brutality  and Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Dr  Cornbleet   s confessed murderer face trial in the United States   Hans Peterson was born in Oregon in 1978  and for the first 28 years of his life he lived in the United States and availed himself of the rights and privileges of U S  citizenship   Only after allegedly committing a heinous crime did Peterson flee the United States for French territory and seek the rights and privileges of French nationality in an attempt to escape criminal prosecution in the United States   There is legitimate concern that Peterson  if found guilty of murder in France  would serve a lesser sentence than he might be expected to serve if tried and convicted in the United States       The French ambassador has verbally indicated to us that Peterson cannot be extradited because French law prohibits the extradition of its nationals   However  Article 3 of the recent Extradition Treaty between the United States and France does not preclude France from extraditing one of its nationals to the United States   Moreover  the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France states that it was concluded in order    to provide for more effective cooperation between the two States in the suppression of crime and to facilitate relations between the two States in the area of extradition         That cooperation appears imminent in the case of Manuel Noriega  and would also be appropriate in the case of Hans Peterson   We have asked the Government of France to provide us with a written analysis reconciling its legal position with the plain language of the Extradition Treaty   To date  we have not received that written analysis    To the extent the Government of France has any discretion available under French law and international treaties to extradite Hans Peterson to the United States  we ask that the Government of the United States  through the State Department  urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition    We thank you in advance for the consideration of this request  and we again request that you reply to this letter as soon as possible  and in no case later than September 18     Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin                                                            United States Senator

Renews Support for Embryonic Stem Cell Research Wednesday  April 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Says proposed alternatives are not substitutes WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement during the debate on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  I stand in full support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act as I did when this bill was introduced and sent to the President   s desk in the 109th Congress   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill   I am frustrated by the opposition this bill has generated and saddened that we are preventing the advancement of important science that could potentially impact millions of suffering Americans   The study of stem cells holds enormous promise for the treatment of debilitating and life threatening diseases   However  in order to reach this level of medical achievement  much more research is necessary to understand  and eventually harness  the amazing potential of stem cells   Instead of creating roadblocks  we must all work together to expand federal funding of stem cell research and continue moving forward in our fight against disease by advancing our knowledge through science and medicine   Each year  100 000 Americans will develop Alzheimer   s disease  with impaired memory  ability to understand  and judgment    Over 1 million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year  and risk complications that include blindness  damaged nerves and loss of kidney function   We all know or have met individuals with spinal cord injuries  including national celebrities  local war heroes and loved ones from our own families and circles of friends  who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence   For most of our history  medicine has offered little hope of recovery to the 100 million individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries   Until now   Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments  if not cures  for those affected by Alzheimer s disease  diabetes  spinal cord injury and countless other conditions   Many men  women  and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the life saving applications of adult stem cell research   Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants  a type of stem cell transplant  which can significantly prolong life  or permanently get rid of the cancer   This therapy has been used successfully for decades  and is saving lives everyday   Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations  Adult stem cells  such as those used in bone marrow transplants  can only be collected in small quantities  may not be a match for the patient  which can lead to rejection  and have limited ability to differentiate  or transform into specialized cells   Similarly  the promising advances of stem cell use from a patient   s own cord blood  as illustrated by the success stories of Dr  Joanne Kurtzberg from Duke University  also have their limitations   If  for example  a young cord blood recipient   s condition should deteriorate after his or her initial treatment  or should develop another illness  there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use    The few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future treatment  or stem cells would have to be obtained from another source   Two of my constituents  Mary Schneider and her son Ryan  are well aware of the potential of cord blood treatments   Her son  diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 2 years of age  has made what appears to be a full recovery after treatment with his own cord blood   Despite the compelling results witnessed by the Schneider family  they also firmly believe and support expanded research of embryonic stem cells to combat disease   A recent scientific paper about stem cells derived from amniotic fluid has drawn much attention   While this offers an exciting alternative to regenerative medicine therapies  the author of that report  Dr  Anthony Atala  has himself urged that his work on amniotic stem cells will not replace the continued need for investigation into treatments with stem cells derived from embryos   All of these alternative treatments are just that  alternatives  and are not substitutes for embryonic stem cell research   Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources  including in vitro fertilization   At this very moment  there are over 400 000 embryos being stored in over 400 facilities throughout the United States  The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples  However  many of these embryos will go unused  destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal    We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos  just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use  cord blood use  and amniotic fluid use   The promise of embryonic stem cells has come to light in a recent achievement by researchers at Johns Hopkins   They were able to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats through embryonic stem cells   One can   t help but wonder when  not if  this research will be translated into techniques that will help human patients who have lost the ability to walk   Of course any work in this area must have appropriate oversight  Embryonic stem cell research demands comprehensive  thoughtful and carefully crafted ethical and scientific guidelines  We must not only look to guidance from the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration but also to our reason  our morals and our compassion   The President   s veto of the stem cell bill proposed in the last Congress prevents government funding beyond 78 previously established stem cell lines   However  recent estimates on the number of viable cell lines bring the numbers down closer to 20   Clearly  we are moving backwards in our efforts with these current restrictions   Stymieing embryonic stem cell research is a step in the wrong direction   It closes the door on many Americans awaiting new treatments that could potentially provide a better quality of life  or  perhaps  even save their life   My hope  and the hope of so many in this country  is to provide our researchers with the means to explore the uses of embryonic stem cells so that we can begin to turn the tide on the devastating diseases affecting our nation and the world                                   ,Obama

Review for Poor Performance  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt  calling on him to immediately release a list of 128 nursing homes that are being scrutinized for providing poor care   According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  identified these facilities because of their history of consistent violations of health and safety regulations  such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  serious neglect  and physical abuse   To date  the Department has identified only 54 of these facilities  refusing to disclose the names of the other 74 facilities  thereby potentially endangering the health and safety of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens   Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   Evan Bayh  D IN   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Ron Wyden  D OR  also signed the letter    In the letter  the nine senators also called on Leavitt to provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies as to whether they are permitted to release such information to the public   Last week  Obama sent a similar letter to Leavitt  vowing to pursue legislative action if this information is not released  Obama has not yet received a response to that letter  The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Leavitt  We are writing to express our serious objections to the withholding of critical information about nursing home conditions from America   s senior citizens  An estimated 1 5 million residents live in approximately 16 000 nursing homes in the United States   This year  federal  state  and local governments will spend  82 billion on nursing home care  of which  56 5 billion will come from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid   All nursing homes that receive federal funding are subject to federal regulation and annual inspections   Under federal law  these inspections are a matter of public record and are made available to nursing home residents and their family members  and summaries of the inspection reports are posted on your department   s Nursing Home Compare website  www medicare gov NHCompare   These federal inspection and public disclosure requirements ensure that nursing home residents are receiving the high quality of care that they deserve   Given the importance of protecting one of our nation   s most vulnerable populations  we were disturbed to learn that your department is withholding information about some of the worst performing nursing homes in the country    According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has compiled a list of 128    special focus facilities    that are among the worst performing nursing homes in the country   These facilities are ones that have consistently been cited for serious violations of health and safety regulations     violations such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  pressure sores  serious neglect  and physical abuse   If these violations are not corrected  the facility could be subject to penalties and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs    However  of the 128 worst performing facilities  only 54 of these nursing homes have been publicly identified   The remaining 74 facilities have not been disclosed to the public  even though this information would be invaluable not only to current residents of those facilities but also to potential residents and their family members   It is incomprehensible why the complete list of 128 facilities     which is determined on the basis of publicly available inspection reports     would not be made public  Although the names of the 128    special focus facilities    have not been made available to the public  press accounts suggest that the complete list has been provided to the American Health Care Association  the main lobbying organization for the nursing home industry   Providing information about poorly performing nursing homes to the lobbyists who represent those facilities  and not to the senior citizens who would most benefit from this information  is outrageous  There is also some uncertainty among state inspection agencies as to whether states have the right to release the names of the previously undisclosed    special focus facilities      Following recent press stories  the Iowa inspection agency released the names of the five Iowa facilities on the list  yet Texas officials have said they cannot release this information without permission from CMS    Accordingly  we call on you to immediately release the names of all 128    special focus facilities    or at the very least  provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies that they are permitted to release such information to the public   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack

state     said Senator Obama      Metra is the largest commuter rail system in the country  and this will help to make up for the funding shortfalls which have threatened to limit service around Chicago   This bill will also fund a frontline health care program that will bring treatment directly to children in underserved communities who suffer from asthma   I am also pleased to have secured funding to modernize Rock Island   s Martin Luther King Jr  Community Center to expand peer counseling and educational programs  which will give children in the Quad Cities an extra boost on their

the Grand Avenue Underpass allows for the constant flow of traffic under the new combined rail line    3 000 000 to the Illinois Department of Transportation to improve trails across Illinois   Senator Obama worked with Senator Durbin to provide  3 000 000 to the Illinois Department of Transportation to improve trails across the state of Illinois   This funding will be used to improve bike

Thursday  July 12  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation calls for moratorium until comprehensive review of personality disorder discharge procedures WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Christopher Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Patty Murray  D WA  today introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and an establishment of an independent discharge review board   Recent reports suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately and inconsistently used personality disorder discharges to swiftly discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs     Such discharges can result in the loss of needed healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt     Given the thousands of American service members currently suffering from service connected psychological injuries  reports that the Department of Defense may be improperly diagnosing service members with personality disorders are deeply troubling     said Senator Obama      Given the lasting consequences of a personality disorder discharge  even one misdiagnosis is one too many   This amendment will force the Department of Defense to suspend its use of this discharge procedure until Secretary Gates can conduct a comprehensive review of these policies and establish a review board to ensure our service members have recourse when their cases are in doubt   It is our moral obligation to ensure that our service members receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve   That   s one thing about this war we can still get right         Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This amendment will put a stop to these discharges until we can fix the system     said Senator Bond      The men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom have earned a debt of gratitude from all Americans that we will never be able to pay in full   The very least we can do is take care of their battle wounds  whether physical or mental  and ensure they receive the treatment and benefits they deserve     Senator Boxer said   It is unconscionable that some of our brave servicemen and women  including those suffering from PTSD and other mental health problems  may be receiving improper discharges for personality disorders and  in turn  denied disability benefits and guaranteed care from the Department of Veterans Affairs   This amendment halts these discharges until measures are put in place to ensure they are handled properly   We owe our brave service men and women nothing less      We have no greater obligation to those who serve our country in the Armed Services than to ensure they get the care they   ve been promised     McCaskill said     We cannot stand tall and proud as Americans if we allow one single service member to go without the benefits they deserve due to a misdiagnosis  Far too many combat troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are returning with mental health injuries that bear the potential for misdiagnosis  and we need to do all we can to prevent that from occurring        We need to take a    time out    on these discharges and get the facts  We need ensure these discharges are medically accurate and that service members are not being denied the treatment or benefits they deserve     Senator Murray said  This amendment mandates a temporary moratorium on personality disorder discharges until the Department of Defense conducts a proper review and revision of its current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis   It also gives the DOD flexibility by granting an exception to the moratorium in those cases in which a service member provides false or misleading information  or omits information about past criminal behavior during the recruitment or enlistment process   The moratorium would be lifted after the DOD reviews its current policies  ensures it is following standard clinical diagnostic practices  and has established an independent review board to ensure that service members who have received this diagnosis may seek a review  On June 21  2007  Senators Bond  Boxer  Obama  Lieberman  McCaskill  Murray  and twenty five other Democratic and Republican senators wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly  Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time                                   ,Obama

Papas Call on Indiana Governor  US EPA  and Regional EPA to work with US Steel to protect Lake Michigan  WASHINGTON  D C      Continuing their effort to fight for the environmental health and protection of Lake Michigan  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Rahm Emanuel  D IL  today  along with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and members of the Chicago delegation  sent a letter to U S  Steel Corporation  calling for a meeting with the Chairman and CEO to discuss Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s  IDEM  proposal to give U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana a wastewater permit that would allow them to operate for five more years without complying with current clean water standards      Durbin and Emanuel also sent letters to both the EPA Administrator  and the Region 5 EPA office commending them for coming out in opposition to the permit and asking them to work with IDEM and U S  Steel to right the situation   They sent a fourth letter to the Governor of Indiana asking for his cooperation    In today s letter to U S  Steel the members wrote     Lake Michigan is our Grand Canyon  our Yellowstone  and we hope that you will join us in working to protect the lake   It is our understanding that US Steel has been working to come into compliance with clean water requirements at the Gary  Indiana facility for over a decade   We strongly oppose any efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan      According to an article in today   s Chicago Tribune  Gary Works  located about 15 miles southeast of Chicago  is the largest source of water pollution in the Lake Michigan basin  dumping more than 1 7 million pounds in 2005   The facility has been operating under an expired permit that has been extended by state officials since 1994   The proposed permit would allow Gary Works to increase its discharge of pollutants  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  and nitrates  into the Grand Calumet River  which flows directly into Lake Michigan   Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional 5 years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  Senator Durbin and Congressman Emanuel sent four letters regarding the proposed IDEM permit   In a letter to the EPA Administrator  Stephen Johnson  both Illinois members applauded EPA for rejecting the proposed IDEM permit and urged them to review all proposed permits in order to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act   Further  in their letter to the EPA Region 5 Administrator  Mary Gade  Durbin and Emanuel questioned U S  Steel   s compliance with the Clean Water Act  In their letter to the Governor of Indiana  Mitch Daniels  Durbin and Emanuel stressed that economic development and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   Finally  in a letter to the Chairman and

express our strong concern and request a meeting with you to discuss the potential effects of this permit on the health of Lake Michigan and all of the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes account for 95  of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures

efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan   Due to a public dialogue and the involvement of concerned local citizens  BP reconsidered their decision to increase their permitted discharge levels and is now working to expand their Whiting refinery without discharging more ammonia and other pollutants into Lake Michigan   We urge you to reconsider your company   s decision to seek a permit that threatens water quality in Lake Michigan and invite you to meet with us to discuss this important issue   Please contact Jen Waller in Congressman Emanuel   s office at 202 225 4061 or Michael Kolenc in Senator Durbin   s office at 202 224 9447 to set up a meeting  and we look forward to

makes significant strides towards minimizing pollutants      Following this latest news about IDEM   s proposed U S  Steel permit and the recent controversy over BP   s NPDES permit for their Whiting refinery  we are concerned about additional permits under consideration in Indiana   We urge you to undertake a detailed review of any additional  state approved permits to ensure compliance with the

1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington  DC 20460  Dear Administrator Johnson   We are writing to express our strong concern over the Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s proposed wastewater permit for U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana   According to many experts  the permit would allow the Gary Works to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  nitrates and more    Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional five years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  As such  we are relieved to hear that the EPA has formally objected to this permit  particularly with regard to the discharge limits and five year compliance schedules   A mere three months ago  we wrote to express our concern regarding IDEM   s permit for BP   s Whiting  Indiana facility   There are still unanswered questions regarding that permit and EPA   s oversight of its issuance  and we hope that the EPA will work with Indiana to make sure that permits issued by IDEM do not threaten the health of the Great Lakes   We all want to work together to protect Lake Michigan    It has come to our attention that there may be additional permits being reviewed by IDEM and we urge you to undertake a detailed review of all proposed permits to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and the standards of the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative  GLI    It   s time to improve rather than threaten the health of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes  As you are well aware  President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in order to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      We agree with the President that the Great Lakes are among our nation   s greatest treasures  and we need to take action to protect them   We thank you for objecting to the proposed permit allowing U S  Steel to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River and hope that we can work with you as you revise the permit with the state of Indiana to draft a permit consistent with the Clean Water Act  the GLI  and the goal of improving the health of the Great Lakes   Sincerely    Rahm Emanuel

Honorable Mitch Daniels  Governor   Dear Governor Daniels  After reading this morning   s Chicago Tribune article regarding the proposed wastewater permit for US Steel   s Gary  Indiana  facility  we write to express our strong concern about the potential impact of this proposal and others like it on the health of Lake Michigan   President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      The permit currently under review by the State of Indiana appears to move in the opposite direction   You sit in a unique position  with the potential to make a positive  lasting impact on the Lake   The State of Indiana can and should work with industry in the state to encourage compliance with the Clean Water Act goals and to participate as stewards of Lake Michigan     We all know how important Lake Michigan is for our states and for the country   The Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90 percent of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes need greater environmental stewardship  not greater levels of pollution    We believe that economic infrastructure and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   U S  Steel   s Gary Works is one of the region   s biggest employers and contributes to the supply of domestic steel   Our hope is that as U S  Steel serves these functions for our region  it also will recognize its obligation to more aggressively mitigate pollutants discharged into the public waterways   We urge the State of Indiana to reevaluate this permit  and work with the EPA and U S  Steel to protect the Lake      Sincerely   Rahm Emanuel                                        Member of Congress                                           Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator                                  ,Obama

VA Oversight Thursday  October 11  2007  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama  Inadequate background check may have put veterans at risk WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Gordon Mansfield asking questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez who has been linked to some extent to the recent spike in deaths at the Marion VA Medical Center   A cursory check of publicly available information by staff members from both Senate offices uncovered questionable information that should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation by the VA      It appears the VA   s efforts to discover the truth about Dr  Veizaga Mendez  his past professional history  and the circumstances surrounding his license forfeiture were far from adequate and may have put the veterans seeking care at Marion in danger     the Illinois Senators wrote      This is an extremely alarming revelation that calls into question the adequacy of the oversight exercised by the VA as it evaluates and monitors those who provide care to our veterans      On September 14  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths   Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed   During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  In an October 3 meeting with Senator Durbin  Dr  Michael Kussman  Under Secretary of VA for Health and Dr  Gerald Cross  Principal Deputy Under Secretary insisted that the VA could not have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed     Both Senators Durbin and Obama have actively pressed the VA for information on the situation at the Marion VA Medical Center   Last month  they sent a letter to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  asking specific questions about the VA   s response to the increase in deaths at the center   They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August    This followed a September 17 letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation   In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated   text of letter below and attached October 11  2007 The Honorable Gordon Mansfield  Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Mansfield  We are writing to follow up on two previous letters we sent to Secretary Nicholson last month with regard to the situation at the Marion  IL  Veterans Administration Medical Center  VAMC  and specifically on the hiring and employment of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez   Continued revelations about Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s record both before and during his employment at the Marion VAMC have raised serious concerns about the adequacy of the VA   s credentialing and quality control systems  In our letter to Secretary Nicholson of September 24  we asked him to explain the background check process that is conducted by the VA before hiring medical staff   Additionally  specific concerns regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s employment were raised directly with Undersecretary Kussman and Deputy Undersecretary Cross in a meeting last week   Dr  Kussman and Dr  Cross both insisted that the VA had conducted due diligence when it became aware that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his medical license in Massachusetts   They asserted that there was no way the VA could have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed   However  a cursory check by our staff of publicly available information has cast doubt on the validity of that claim   Although our staff did not have access to the full range of information that hospitals and state medical boards have  we were still able to uncover questionable information about Dr  Veizaga Mendez of sufficient magnitude that it should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation before the VA continued to entrust the lives of our veterans to his care  It appears the VA   s efforts to discover the truth about Dr  Veizaga Mendez  his past professional history  and the circumstances surrounding his license forfeiture were far from adequate and may have put the veterans seeking care at Marion in danger   This is an extremely alarming revelation that calls into question the adequacy of the oversight exercised by the VA as it evaluates and monitors those who provide care to our veterans   We have specific questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Veizaga Mendez and on the oversight of care givers throughout the VA Medical System      1  An October 5  2007  Associated Press article cites Pete McBrady  acting director of the Marion VAMC  as saying that the VAMC    has a board consisting of a group of practicing physicians at the hospital who vet each candidate for hire    and that    there was no evidence that would set off any alarms about Veizaga Mendez with the Marion panel when they reviewed the doctor      Prior to hiring Dr  Veizaga Mendez  what inquiries did the VAMC make to public or private sources concerning his qualifications   What specific evidence did the VAMC obtain when it reviewed Dr  Veizaga Mendez prior to his hiring   2  Did the VAMC contact the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine  Massachusetts Board  regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s qualifications prior to his hiring   3  We have been informed by the Massachusetts Board that the Board operates a publicly accessible internet site featuring profiles of physicians licensed in Massachusetts   We also have been informed that when he was hired by the Marion VAMC in January 2006  Dr  Veizaga Mendez had a profile on the Massachusetts Board   s internet site that would have disclosed  at minimum  that he had been the subject of a hospital disciplinary action in 2004  and that he made two medical malpractice payments  one in 2004 and one in 2005    Did the VAMC access the Massachusetts Board   s internet profile of Dr  Veizaga Mendez before hiring him   If so  what was the VA   s response to the information contained in the profile   4  Dr  Veizaga Mendez voluntarily surrendered his Massachusetts license in July 2006   How was the VA notified he had surrendered his license  What investigation was undertaken by the VA to determine the cause and circumstances   Was the VA informed about allegations of professional misconduct against Dr  Veizaga Mendez that were made by the Massachusetts Board   5  Did Dr  Veizaga Mendez provide any written representations regarding the surrender of his Massachusetts license   If so  what were those representations   6  We have been informed that Dr  Veizaga Mendez has filed an appeal before the Massachusetts Division of Administrative Law Appeals in response to allegations raised by the Massachusetts Board   Was the VA aware of any such appeal    7  According to regulations governing the Massachusetts Board  the VA is not explicitly included on a list of    designated agencies    that are entitled to request and view non public information from the Massachusetts Board   Why is the VA not included on this list   Are there other states in which the VA is not entitled to request and review non public information from state medical licensing boards   What steps  if any  has the VA taken to address this flaw in the VA   s access to information about physicians   8  What assurances can you provide us that there are not other cases of similar circumstances at the Marion VAMC and at other VA hospitals   9  What steps are you taking to ensure that troubling information about VA physicians is not overlooked in the future   Due to the seriousness of this issue  we would appreciate a prompt response    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin

                                    Obama Addresses Foreign Relations Committee Hearing with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker Tuesday  September 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511   WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing with General David H  Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C  Crocker  Below is Senator Obama   s statement as prepared for delivery     Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing and for giving us an opportunity to gather more information about the situation in Iraq   I also appreciate the willingness of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to provide an update on the situation from their perspectives  I look forward to their assessment of the situation on the ground in Iraq  a situation that can only be described as grave        We ve heard from the Administration and from many of our Senate colleagues this summer that we need to give the President s surge strategy more time before we can make a decision to redeploy our troops   However  two reports issued over the past week paint a bleak picture of the prospects of the current strategy   These reports reinforce the conclusion that there is no military solution in Iraq  that we need to get our troops out of the middle of Iraq s civil war  and that this war must be brought to a responsible conclusion      The U S  Government Accountability Office concluded that the Iraqi government has failed to meet 11 of its 18 benchmarks   Another 4 benchmarks have been only partially met    In particular  GAO cited the failure of the Iraqi government to enact legislation on de Baathification  oil revenue sharing  provincial elections  amnesty  and militia disarmament    Moreover  according to GAO  the Iraqi government has not eliminated militia control of local security  it has not eliminated political intervention in military operations  it has not ensured even handed enforcement of the law  and it has not increased the number of army units capable of independent operations   The effect of this failure to act has been a high level of sectarian violence that can only be seen as having abated when it is measured against the explosion of violence late last year and early this year        And last week  an independent commission chaired by General James Jones offered a similarly bleak assessment   The Jones Commission found that the Iraqi Security Forces will not be able to carry out their essential security responsibilities without assistance for at least 12 to 18 months    The Commission also found that the Iraqi Police Service is incapable of providing adequate security to protect Iraqis from insurgents and sectarian violence and that the National Police is so infiltrated by sectarian militias that it should be disbanded and reorganized      These independent assessments     and the stunningly bleak NIE released at the end of last month     make clear that there has been zero national political progress   The consensus from the NIE  GAO  and General Jones is that the Iraqi Security Forces have made little progress        Rather than identify the very limited tactical gains that have been made at great cost and using them to justify the maintenance of a failing strategy  I believe it is time to change course   Over 3 700 American servicemen and women have died in this war and over 27 000 have been seriously wounded   Each month  this misguided war costs us a staggering  10 billion  and when all is said and done  this will have cost us  1 trillion      Changing the definition of success to stay the course with the wrong policy is the wrong course for our troops and our national security   The time to end the surge and to start bringing our troops home is now     not six months from now   The Iraqi government is not achieving the political progress that was the stated purpose of the surge  and in key areas has gone backwards      Our military cannot sustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to respond to contingencies around the world   It s time for a change of direction that brings our troops home  applies real pressure on the Iraqis to act  surges our diplomacy  and addresses Iraq s urgent humanitarian crisis   I can only support a policy that begins an immediate removal of our troops from Iraq s civil war  and initiates a sustained drawdown of our military presence        It is long past time to turn the page in Iraq  where each day we see the consequences of fighting a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged    We in Congress must take action to change the President s failed policy                                        ,Obama

Obama  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Congressman Adam Smith  D WA  today hailed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee s passage of the Global Poverty Act  S 2433   which requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs  This legislation was introduced in December   Smith and Congressman Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House last September    With billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world  global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces   said Senator Obama   It must be a priority of American foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water  As we strive to rebuild America s standing in the world  this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere  I commend Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar for supporting this bill and moving it forward quickly    Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century   Senator Hagel said    This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world    Global poverty directly impacts our national security  We must rally private sector and government resources to eliminate extreme global poverty and to fight global disease   said Senator Cantwell    With more than 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day  it is of the utmost importance to make sure these people get the help they need and push for sustainable economic growth  We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries and extend our hand to people in need      Global poverty is one of the greatest moral and security challenges facing the world today  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion live on less than  1 a day   This bill represents a major advance in our effort to address global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I am pleased to see the Senate Foreign Relations Committee take significant steps toward its final passage   Congressman Smith said   For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world s poorest people  In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015  We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act   Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015   Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables     Requires the President to report back to Congress on progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy    The legislation is supported by a broad range of groups  including Bread for the World  the United States Conference

2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACTS  Liz Richardson Kerry   Michael Ortiz Obama   Liz Farrar  Ellsworth   or Kathleen Connery  Emanuel   Reform Closes Offshore Tax Loopholes that Government Contractors Use To Dodge Social Security Taxes  WASHINGTON  DC   Sens  John Kerry  D Mass   and Barack Obama  D Ill   are introducing the  Fair Share Act of 2008   today with Reps  Brad Ellsworth  IN  and Rahm Emanuel  D Ill   The reform will close the loophole that recently has allowed the defense contractor KBR Inc  to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year   It was discovered that KBR has avoided paying its fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Setting up sham companies in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying Social Security taxes for workers turns the idea of patriotism on its head  No wonder Americans are disgusted with Washington when big corporations profit from no bid contracts for the war in Iraq  then hide money and costs offshore to avoid paying taxes while hard working Americans get stuck with the bill   said Sen  Kerry    KBR is abusing the public trust at the taxpayer s expense  and our reform will close the loophole that enables big corporations to take advantage of the American people     American companies have a responsibility to pay taxes  and guarantee that their employees will receive the Medicare and Social Security benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Sen  Obama    It s unacceptable for Federal contractors to use foreign affiliates or tax shelters in order to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes and to shirk on their basic obligations to American workers   This critical legislation will increase accountability and transparency of our tax system  and ensure that Federal contractors who are working on behalf of the American taxpayer do not abuse the tax system    These government contractors have been receiving millions  sometimes billions  in taxpayer dollars  Yet they still have the audacity to circumvent our tax system and cheat their workers  the taxpayers  and our government   said Rep  Ellsworth   It s clear Congress cannot stand by and hope these companies will do the right thing  The Fair Share Act restores some needed accountability to the government contracting process  protecting American workers and ensuring all companies compete on an equal playing field    Honest middle class American taxpayers who pay their taxes deserve a tax system where companies cannot use every trick in the book to rig the system to avoid paying their fair share   said Rep  Emanuel   Known best this week as the company who gave our troops tainted water  KBR is taking advantage of a tax loophole that hurts Social Security and Medicare and prevents their own U S  employees working abroad from being able to qualify for these vital programs  And just like we did in 2004 when we closed the Bermuda loophole that allowed companies to lower their taxes by setting up a mailing address in Bermuda  we are going to shut down this egregious loophole   Summary of the Legislation The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes   The legislation will apply to foreign subsidiaries of a U S  parent   The degree of common ownership applied by the legislation is 50 percent  meaning that the U S  parent would have to at least own 50 percent of the subsidiary  In addition  the legislation addresses the situation in which a U S  subsidiary of a foreign corporation subcontracts with a foreign subsidiary to perform a contract with the U S government   In this situation  the legislation would apply to wages paid by the foreign subsidiary to its U S  employees  The legislation does not address the situation in which the foreign parent contracts directly with the U S  government   Present law will continue to apply to totalization agreements   Effective Date of Legislation  This legislation applies to services performed after the date of enactment

Suspicious Katrina Contracts Highlight Need for CFO Oversight   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today issued the following statement in the wake of reports of waste  mismanagement and fraud in the handling Hurricane Katrina rebuilding effort    Just a few weeks into the most expensive rebuilding effort of all time  we re already hearing reports of overcharges  underperformance  and mismanagement   said Obama and Coburn    Finding out after the fact that we re spending taxpayer money on no bid contracts and sweetheart deals for cruise lines is no way to run a recovery effort   We re already seeing examples that highlight the need for an independent CFO who will be in charge of every penny that goes out the door  The American public and the people of the Gulf Coast deserve no less       The Senate Federal Financial Management Subcommittee s investigation into a six month  192 million FEMA contract with Carnival Cruise Lines has discovered that taxpayers are paying  per evacuee  four times the amount a vacation cruise passenger would have to pay   Three Carnival ships are only half full and mostly occupied by relief workers   Carnival s overhead costs in the FEMA operation are far lower than during normal cruises   The Carnival ships are docked   No fuel is being used and no entertainment is being provided to the relief workers   Yet  taxpayers are paying  2 550 per guest per week  which is four times the cost of a  599 per person  7 Day Western Caribbean  Cruise from Galveston  TX   When the federal government would actually save millions of dollars by forgoing the status quo and actually sending evacuees on a luxurious six month cruise it is time to rethink how we are conducting oversight   A short term temporary solution has turned into a long term  grossly overpriced sweetheart deal for a cruise line   Obama and Coburn said    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    Richard Skinner  the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security said that FEMA officials awarding contracts  took a lot of shortcuts that may have resulted in a lot of waste    said Obama and Coburn   We should appoint a CFO immediately to ensure that rebuilding and reconstruction money gets to the people who need it the most   SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina   Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse   The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President   The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies and the president   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers                                     ,Obama

Obama and Coburn s letter       August 14  2006    The Honorable R  David Paulison  Director  Federal Emergency Management Agency  500 C Street S W   Washington  D C  20472 Dear Mr  Paulison  We are writing to express our grave concern about the contracting practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  that were highlighted August 9th in the Washington Post   According to the Post  four no bid contracts awarded to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees have ballooned in value from  400 million to about  3 4 billion    In private meetings with us on December 15  2005 and May 17  2006  you expressed similar concerns about the use of no bid contracts and promised that FEMA would employ non competitive procedures rarely and only when absolutely necessary to avoid unacceptable disruption to critical services     You also have made similar public statements to our Senate colleagues   In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6  2005  you stated  I ve been a public servant for a long time  and I ve never been a fan of no bid contracts   Sometimes you have to do them because of the expediency of getting things done   And I can assure that you we are going to look at all of those contracts very carefully   All of those no bid contracts  we are going to go back and re bid  Given your strong statements in opposition to no bid contracts  we were greatly troubled to learn that FEMA is continuing to extend these contracts to the point that their value is now more than eight times the original contract value   Since we are nearing the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  we question whether any emergency remains that would justify a continued reliance on no bid procedures  Indeed  just last week  we learned that the four contractors   Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw   who received the original no bid contracts were awarded new contracts to provide temporary housing   Each of these new awards has a contract ceiling of  250 million   And while the congressional advisory announcing the awards indicates that these contracts were awarded  through a full and open process   concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the competitive process  We cannot express to you in strong enough terms how serious this issue is to us and our Senate colleagues   On four separate occasions over the past year  the Senate has unanimously approved amendments to limit the use of non competitive procedures in contracting  The American people deserve the benefits of competition in government contracts   Competition is good for American business  and it s good for the government   It helps to ensure high quality and low costs   Competition is what the American people have a right to expect  and that s what we intend to achieve   In order for us to assess whether additional Senate action is necessary  we request that you respond to the following questions by August 31  2006 What efforts  if any  have you made to stop the use of no bid procedures  What procedures were used for the latest  250 million contracts awarded to Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw  What  if any  additional resources or authority do you need to stop the use of no bid procedures      Sincerely  Tom Coburn  M D   United States Senator Barack Obama

  Senators Concerned Service Members Suffering from Mental Illness are Not Receiving Impartial Reviews   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Senators Concerned Service Members Suffering from Mental Illness are Not Receiving Impartial Reviews Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Contact  Natalie Ravitz  Boxer   Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Liz Richardson  Kerry   Case of Lt  Whiteside illustrates the need to review DoD policy Washington  D C    U S  Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Barack Obama   D IL  and John Kerry  D MA  today sent the following letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates    December 14  2007 The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   We are concerned over reports that members of our Armed Forces with underlying mental health conditions are not receiving balanced  fair  and impartial reviews when facing judicial punishment and administrative discharge for engaging in misconduct that could be related to their conditions   We understand and support the necessity of maintaining good order and discipline in the military  At the same time  we are concerned that the decision to prosecute a service member with serious mental health issues may  in some cases  be carried out without appropriate consideration of recommendations made by uniformed mental health providers  As such  we ask you to promptly review guidelines for the administrative handling of such complex cases    On December 2  2007  The Washington Post ran a story entitled    A Soldier   s Officer    that clearly illustrates our concerns  The piece details the ordeal of Army First Lieutenant Elizabeth Whiteside  who according to available reports  served honorably at both Water Reed Army Medical Center  WRAMC  and in Iraq before experiencing severe mental health symptoms and attempting suicide  During her apparent suicide attempt  Lt  Whiteside threatened a number of her fellow service members  and as a result  we understand the Army is currently deciding whether to pursue a court martial against her    What we find particularly troubling about this case is that military commanders with no medical training derided the documented medical opinions as to Lt  Whiteside   s mental condition and their bearing on the case  Colonel Terrence J  McKenrick  commander of the Warrior Transition Brigade at Walter Reed  charged that even though medical professionals had determined Lt  Whiteside had a    severe mental disease or defect  she knowingly assaulted and threatened others and injured herself     Another commander wrote that Lt  Whiteside   s    defense that she suffers from a mental disease excusing her actions is just that   an excuse  an excuse to distract from choices and decisions made by Lt  Whiteside     These statements are contrary to the apparent recommendations of Lt  Whiteside   s battalion commander in Iraq that disciplinary actions not be taken  and show a callous disregard for the diagnosis of qualified psychiatrists at WRAMC  who found that Lt  Whiteside suffered from a    severe major depressive disorder and a personality disorder    and    disassociation with reality      We believe that service members should be held accountable for their actions  and we recognize that the Manual for Courts Martial provides procedures for handling mental health issues in judicial proceedings  However  this case highlights the need for the Department to review its administrative procedures and training programs to ensure that commanders give full and fair consideration of the recommendations made by trained mental health providers before initiating disciplinary actions against soldiers suffering from mental diseases   Additionally  as Senators who have worked extensively to improve mental health care services for our armed forces  we find it unacceptable that officers with no medical training   who are required by law to protect the impartiality of the military justice process   would make dismissive statements regarding Lt  Whiteside   s mental health condition  These comments only undermine respect for the mental health profession and increase the stigma associated with seeking mental health care   According to the Congressionally mandated report of the Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health     every military leader bears responsibility for addressing stigma  leaders who fail to do so reduce the effectiveness of the service members they lead     The Department is best served by ending policies that discriminate against service members who suffer from mental health problems and working to eliminate the stigma that prevents too many from seeking care  That is why we strongly urge you to ensure that the recommendations of qualified medical professionals play a clearly defined and important role in proceedings to discharge or punish any service member with an underlying mental health condition    Thank you for your consideration of this important request     Sincerely    Barbara Boxer                                             United States Senator                                    Christopher S  Bond  United States Senator

Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jesse Broder Van Dyke  Akaka   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Aaron Murphy  Tester    Washington  DC     U S  Senators Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Barack Obama  D IL   and Jon Tester  D MT  today sent letters to the Attorney General  and the Inspector Generals of the Defense and State Departments  seeking information about their apparent failure to investigate allegations made by former Halliburton KBR administrative assistant Jamie Leigh Jones that she was drugged and raped by several co workers while employed at Camp Hope in Baghdad  Iraq     The alleged assault occurred in July 2005  three days after KBR had transferred Ms  Jones to work in Iraq   Ms  Jones was treated at a U S  Army Hospital in Iraq after reporting that she was raped   According to recent news reports  no criminal charges have been filed in the matter and reporters have been unable to confirm that any federal agency is investigating       With tens of thousands of American contractors operating in Iraq  we will not tolerate abuse and misconduct  and these contractors must be held accountable to American criminal law     said Senator Obama      I first introduced legislation nearly 10 months ago to hold contractors accountable  and I will continue to work to develop a solution that closes the legal loopholes  protects our troops and civilians  and promotes America   s values     Senator Akaka said     It has been more than two years since Ms  Jones reported that she was drugged and raped   Ms  Jones    allegations are extremely disturbing  yet it seems that KBR  the Defense Department  and the State Department may have ignored the matter rather than seeking the truth   Some media accounts have suggested that security contractors have blanket legal immunity for what they do in Iraq   That is untrue   But the existing legal loopholes for U S  government contractors working abroad     and the widespread perception that these contractors operate completely free of legal constraints     must be addressed   Congress should make this an urgent priority     Akaka noted that jurisdiction for any future criminal charges brought in the case could come under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 or section 804 of the USA PATRIOT Act      We must ensure that security contractors are subject to real oversight   I will push for a full  fair  and transparent investigation of Jamie Leigh Jones    allegations  and I will continue to support legislation to ensure that security contractors are held to high standards     Akaka stated       I don   t care if it   s in rural Montana  inner city Washington  or military bases in Baghdad   no one is above the law     Senator Tester said      We   ve got some serious questions about this case and it   s not acceptable to sit around waiting for answers     Senator Akaka is Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management  the Federal Workforce  and the District of Columbia  as well as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness   Senators Obama and Tester are

misconduct allegedly committed against Ms  Jamie Leigh Jones while working for Halliburton KBR in Baghdad  Iraq   As you may know  Ms  Jones has filed a civil complaint alleging that she was drugged

transported to the area U S  Army hospital where a rape kit was administered  and KBR informed the State Department of the incident  2    To date  the Justice Department has not filed any charges against anyone in connection with this incident    Please answer the following questions no later than Thursday  December 20  2007    1  When and by whom was your office informed of the alleged attack

   and Barack Obama  D Ill   asked Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin to delay a vote on media ownership until the FCC has followed the will of Congress and established a commission to look into minority and women media ownership  Kerry and Obama made clear that if Martin once again bucked the Congress  they would ask the Appropriations Committee to deny funding for implementation of the rule produced by the forced vote     This is a show down with an FCC Chairman who is letting the FCC do the bidding of big corporate conglomerates without giving smaller media outlets a chance to fight back     said Senator John Kerry     I want to thank Sen  Obama for joining with me to help hold the FCC accountable  and ensuring that it promotes a more diverse  independent media in America          We must ensure that we have an open media market that represents all of the voices in our diverse nation  and allows them to be heard     said Senator Obama      The FCC must meet its obligations to our country   s minority communities and not special interests by ensuring that broadcasters are doing right by the communities they operate in before it considers loosening media ownership regulations   I reiterate my call to the FCC to conduct its rules changes in a transparent and inclusive process  respect minority interests  and delay its upcoming vote until further evaluations are completed      Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules   By moving forward with Tuesday   s vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Senators Kerry and Obama sent a similar letter urging the FCC to act on this issue in July  2006  Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules   By moving forward with Tuesday   s vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Below is the text of the letter  December 14  2007 The Honorable Kevin J  Martin  Chairman  Federal Communications Commission  445 12th Street SW  Washington  DC 20554 Dear Chairman Martin  Your testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee on December 13  2007 restates your intention to move forward aggressively with a proposal that would relax media ownership rules with respect to the Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule   We reiterate our call from July of last year and in various forums over the last two months for you to delay this vote for a period of time sufficient for the Commission to examine the status of minority and women media ownership in the United States  and to establish a policy to effectively address the need to promote greater diversity in media markets       With respect to this issue  the intent of the Senate Commerce Committee was made clear with its decision to unanimously report S  2332  the Media Ownership Act of 2007   Section 2 of this bill would require the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to establish and convene an independent panel to make recommendations for specific rules to increase the representation of women and minorities in the ownership of broadcast media   The bill further states that the FCC must act on the panel s recommendations before voting on any changes to its broadcast and newspaper ownership rules  We recognize the widespread animosity aimed at the direction of the Commission regarding Tuesday   s scheduled vote   We understand that for a variety of reasons you are being asked to postpone the vote to permit more time for the Commission to fully understand how a relaxation in the Cross Ownership Rule will impact other important issues such as localism   It is our hope that the sum of these objections will convince you to delay this vote until a time following the Commission   s consideration of other pressing matters   Specifically  we believe that moving forward with this change will have a direct and detrimental impact on the state of media diversity   Should you decide to move forward with this vote against the expressed bipartisan  bicameral intent of Congress  we will approach Appropriations Chairman Byrd with a request that funds be denied for the implementation of this rule    Thank you for your consideration   Should you have any questions regarding this request  please do not hesitate to contact any of us at any time  Sincerely  Sen  John Kerry                                 Sen  Barack Obama  Kerry and Obama co sponsored a bill that would require the FCC to have a 90 day comment period on any proposed media ownership rule changes and to conduct a separate proceeding on localism with another 90 day comment period   The bill also requires the FCC to convene an independent panel to make recommendations regarding specific rules to increase women and minority ownership of broadcast media   The FCC would be required to act on the panel   s recommendations prior to voting on changes to broadcast ownership regulations   The bill was sponsored by

WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  
   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. 
   ""Stem cell research gives hope to Lila and millions of Americans challenged by osteosarcoma, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and a myriad of diseases and conditions this research might help or even cure,"" Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse also praised the efforts of Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin (D), a champion of stem cell legislation nationally and in Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts. Roberts today released a statewide report on stem cells, a first step toward developing a comprehensive plan for research initiatives in Rhode Island. 
   The Stem Cell Enhancement Act (S. 5) expands the number of human embryonic stem cells eligible for federally-funded research beyond the arbitrary limits imposed by President Bush in August 2001. The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research on stem cells derived from embryos currently stored in fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed. 
   Last year, 63 senators voted to pass the Stem Cell Enhancement Act (H.R. 810), legislation similar to S. 5. President Bush issued the first veto of his presidency to block the bipartisan measure.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BEGIN BRINGING TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ
  President Bush's refusal to say when American troops will come home from Iraq leaves America less safe and adds to the already-immense burdens facing service members and their families, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who traveled to Iraq a year ago, reiterated his belief that an announcement that the United States plans to redeploy its forces is the strongest weapon at our disposal to bring about political progress in Iraq:
   ""It's time for President Bush to listen to the American people and take action to bring our troops home from Iraq. Today, again, the President made clear that he has no intention of doing that.
   ""Iraq is embroiled in a sectarian civil war. It's clear the violence will not stop until the Iraqis take responsibility for the security and governance of their nation. To hasten that day of reconciliation, America can do one thing and one thing only: we must announce that we will redeploy our troops.
   ""Instead, President Bush has chosen to leave our servicemen and women in harm's way indefinitely, with no assurance of when, or under what conditions, they will come home. America's military has been strained almost to the breaking point, taking a serious toll on the health and welfare of our service members and their families, and leaving us ill-prepared to face gathering threats around the world.
   ""With more than 4,000 American lives lost and hundreds of billions of American tax dollars spent, the most important question for our nation is this: when can our troops return? President Bush's refusal to answer that question fails our troops, repudiates the will of the American people, and mortgages our country's security and our future.""

WHITEHOUSE TELLS NOMINEE
  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must undertake a thorough, comprehensive review of the process by which the agency makes decisions to determine whether Bush administration officials have put political considerations above science and the law, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today at a confirmation hearing for the nominee to be EPA's general counsel. 
   ""The fact that the courts of the United States have felt compelled to characterize the positions EPA has taken in recent litigation by referring to Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland is embarrassing both to the agency and to the American people,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the EPW Committee. ""I'm deeply concerned that this Administration appears to be making legal decisions that impact our environment and public health not on their merits or their likelihood of success, but to advance a political agenda that risks lasting harm to our country.""
   At today's confirmation hearing, the EPW Committee heard testimony from David Hill, President Bush's nominee to be General Counsel of the EPA. Whitehouse closely questioned Hill on his commitment to helping EPA regain the stature and independence it has lost during the Bush Administration.
   There have been numerous signs that the decision-making process at EPA in recent years, and particularly under current Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, has been compromised by political considerations that disregard the demands of federal law and scientific evidence. Since 2001, federal courts have reversed a significant number of EPA's rules, including decisions relating to mercury emissions, water pollution discharges, new source review, and restrictions on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks.
   In New York v. EPA, decided in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said EPA's legal argument supporting its decision to weaken new source review requirements belonged ""in a Humpty Dumpty world."" In New Jersey v. EPA, decided two years later, the same court said EPA's position employs ""the logic of the Queen of Hearts."" Hill acknowledged during today's hearing that he had reviewed those cases.
   Yesterday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) subpoenaed Administrator Johnson for the third time this year to compel the release of documents related to the EPA's denial of a request by California, Rhode Island, and other states to set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Documents reviewed by staff members of the EPW Committee showed that EPA's professional staff pushed Johnson to approve the California waiver, and demonstrated concerns among EPA staff that a denial of the waiver request would not survive a challenge in court. The documents also showed that Johnson consulted with White House officials on the waiver issue.
   On January 2, 2008, California, Rhode Island, and several other states and environmental organizations sued EPA to overturn Johnson's decision. The suit is now pending in the D.C. Circuit Court.

  A year after President Bush's speech to the nation announcing that he would significantly increase U.S. troop levels in Iraq, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) criticized the administration's continued failure to change course and begin bringing our troops home: 
  ""In 2006, the American people sent a clear message to Washington that it was time to seek a new direction in Iraq. Instead, a year ago today President Bush escalated the war, sending tens of thousands more troops into harm's way with assurances that the leaders of Iraq would step forward and work towards political reconciliation. Today, one year later, our troops have performed their duties as directed with skill and bravery - but the Iraqis have not done their part, and the Bush administration has not in its own conduct measured up to their sacrifice. 
  ""Iraq will never stand up until we prepare to stand down. I have told President Bush personally that the prospect of an American redeployment is our best pressure on Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for the security and governance of their country. America cannot continue pouring billions of dollars and thousands of lives and limbs into the sands and marshes of Iraq. The Bush Administration cannot shirk the tough choices it must make. We must announce the process of bringing our troops home.""

  ""It's time to send a clear signal to Iraq and the rest of the world that we are bringing our troops home. We're facing a simple question: is it in our country's best interests for our troops to remain in Iraq? From everything I've seen and heard, the answer is no - and for that reason, it's time to begin a rapid, responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.
  ""In today's report by General Petraeus, the Bush administration argues that security in Iraq is improving - but with 160,000 American troops on the ground and more than $700 billion spent, we should expect some progress of some kind. What has not improved is the political environment necessary for Iraq to begin to stabilize and move forward. Nothing fundamental will change in Iraq unless its leaders have the will to work together.
  ""Our troops need to come home. Then, we can return our focus to issues here at home - from better health care to more affordable education to renewable sources of energy - that will challenge our nation's strength and security for years to come, and where we are losing ground because of this war.""

WHITEHOUSE URGES BUSH FOR NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with President Bush on Wednesday, April 11, to share firsthand the concerns of thousands of Rhode Islanders who believe we need a change of course in Iraq. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently traveled to Iraq as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  
   ""Rhode Islanders, and people throughout the country, have sent a clear message to this administration: it's time for a new direction in Iraq,"" Whitehouse said. ""Today, I had the chance to deliver that message to the President in person. I told him that we want to bring our troops home, and urged him to consider that the strongest force he has at his disposal for a resolution in Iraq is to announce a redeployment and a change of course."" 
   Whitehouse also gave President Bush several letters sent to him by Rhode Islanders concerned about the Bush administration's misguided policy in Iraq. 
   A Cumberland woman whose nephew is serving in Iraq wrote to the President: ""I am proud to be an American! Please, please on behalf of my family and the families of all US troops - bring them home now!"" 
   A woman from Harrisville wrote as her family member was waiting to be deployed: ""Our enemies want us to be mired in a pointless war, wasting our resources and our young people. They want us hurting. Withdrawing from Iraq is the smart thing to do, and that is what our enemies fear most."" 
   A Johnston man whose son is serving in Iraq wrote: ""We the majority of the American people oppose this war and the escalation of troops, even our Generals both active and retired say the escalation of our troops will not help. It is time to bring our men home!"" 
   Several members of Congress were invited to meet with the President following recent official visits to Iraq. Whitehouse traveled there in mid-March on an official congressional delegation visit to meet with American troops and assess the situation on the ground. While in country, he talked with American military commanders, including General David Petraeus, as well as several high-ranking Iraqi officials and members of the U.S. embassy and intelligence staffs. Whitehouse also spoke with Marines from Rhode Island now serving in Fallujah. 
   Whitehouse joined a majority of the Senate to pass war funding legislation that would compel President Bush to begin redeploying American troops from Iraq within four months, with a goal of having all combat troops out of the country by March 31, 2008. Whitehouse also is a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that will limit funding for the war after April 2008 to counter-terrorism, training, and force protection.

   Eng. Jose Socrates Sousa 
  Primeiro Ministro 
  Rue de Imprensa a Estrela 4 
  1200-888 Lisboa PORTUGAL 
   Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
   We write regarding the potential closing of the Portuguese consulate in Rhode Island. 
   As United States Senators, we fully understand the financial pressures which require your decision to cut back on some foreign consulates. However, we would like to highlight the invaluable services the Providence consulate provides to the thousands of citizens of Portuguese descent in New England and how the consulate strengthens the bond between our two nations. 
   The Portuguese consulate in Providence has proved critical in informing residents of the state and the nation about Portugal's policies and concerns and its view of U.S. policy. The consulate offers regular communication with official representatives of the Portuguese government and enhances the ability of the Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island to act together on behalf of these concerns. We and our staffs, as well as our constituents, have also found it useful to work with consular officials on a whole range of subjects. 
   The Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island are dedicated, loyal Americans who contribute to our economy, while they continue to be proud of their Portuguese heritage, which is celebrated so vibrantly in Rhode Island. They rely on the Consulate for innumerable services. Many have contacted me to express their great concern about the potential loss of this valuable resource. While there is consular service in Boston, it is not necessarily easy for those in my state who are in need of consular services to travel there. In addition, the Providence Consulate has proved extremely valuable to my office, including on immigration issues. With Congress poised to consider potential changes in the U.S. immigration system, we foresee even more utilization of the consulate in the future. There is no substitute, even in the day of modern communications, for easy direct personal access among people who share important official concerns. 
   We understand this is a difficult decision that you must make together with your colleagues. However, we hope you will consider all that the Providence consulate provides to the state of Rhode Island and a significant Portuguese-American population. 
   Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have, and thank you for your consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   Jack Reed 
  United States Senator

  President Bush's irresponsible fiscal policies have cost America a staggering $7.7 trillion, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today in remarks delivered on the Senate floor during debate on the Senate's budget resolution. Whitehouse said that the ""Bush Debt,"" a comprehensive account of the impact of surpluses squandered and new debt accumulated over the seven years under President Bush, demonstrates the need for new priorities and fiscal discipline as Congress considers the last budget resolution it will pass under the Bush presidency. 
   ""Instead of keeping our nation on the path to economic security and prosperity, to new investments in our health care system, our students, our seniors, and our veterans, the President who called for 'responsibility' squandered away the surpluses he inherited, mortgaged our children and grandchildren's futures, and compromised the quality of working Americans' lives,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. ""This President will leave behind millions of Americans who, had this Administration merely stayed the course of fiscal responsibility charted by President Clinton, would be far better off than they are today.""
   The ""Bush Debt"" was derived from a calculation of the difference between projections of the nation's fiscal outlook had policies in place under President Clinton been allowed to continue, and the reality under President Bush today. Whitehouse found that Bush's misguided policies, from the war in Iraq to tax breaks for the wealthy, have cost America $7.7 trillion in foregone surpluses and new debt.
   The President's budget for fiscal year 2009 also includes $260 billion in interest payments on the debt next year alone, or $857 for every woman, man, and child in the United States. These massive interest payments take away federal funds that could otherwise be used to benefit the American people. If that $260 billion were available to be spent for other purposes, Whitehouse said, we could provide health insurance to every uninsured American, double the maximum Pell Grant award, cover all remaining children eligible for Head Start, and fix virtually all the nation's bridges in need of repair.
   This week, the Senate is debating a budget resolution that would chart a very different course. This proposal, passed Thursday by the Senate Budget Committee, increases funding for veterans, schools, and transportation infrastructure and provides for a second economic stimulus package to help working families facing continued financial hardship. It would also lower taxes for the middle class and create jobs.

WHITEHOUSE BACKS SENATE EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN HATE CRIME STATUTE
  Citing the need to give local law enforcement stronger tools to prosecute hate crimes, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Thursday, April 12, added his support to new legislation that will include sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability status as part of the federal hate crimes statute.  
   ""Crimes of hate are unacceptable and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Whitehouse. ""I'm proud to support legislation that aims to end these crimes of bias forever."" 
   Currently, only 27 states and Washington, D.C. classify gender-based crimes as hate crimes; 31 states and Washington, D.C. include sexual-orientation based crimes; and only 31 states and Washington, D.C. include disability-based crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has documented more than 114,000 hate crimes since 1991. 
   The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2007, introduced today by Senators Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), will give local law enforcement officials important tools, like training or direct assistance, to combat crimes that show evidence of prejudice based on sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability status. 
   The bill also would encourage Americans to report hate crimes, through increased public education and awareness, and would allow local prosecutors to pursue bias-motivated crime under federal law in areas in which state statutes are inadequate. 
   A similar version of the measure, which had broad, bipartisan support, was passed by both the House and Senate in the 109th Congress, but was scuttled in a conference committee and ultimately did not become law.

WHITEHOUSE MEASURE SAFEGUARDING PRIVACY AGAINST GOVERNMENT SPYING
  During its consideration of reforms to a federal law that sets restrictions on when the government can spy on Americans, the U.S. Senate today passed an amendment sponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) that significantly strengthens judicial oversight and safeguards the privacy rights of innocent Americans who are not targeted for surveillance.  
  ""The Bush administration unilaterally assumed extraordinary authority to tap Americans' phones and to invade Americans' privacy - with seemingly no regard for individual rights,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We need to assure that rules protecting Americans' rights are being followed, and because this administration fears and rejects judicial oversight, that is precisely what is most needed.""
  In 2005, the New York Times reported on a Bush administration program to wiretap electronic communications by Americans inside the country without first obtaining warrants, in an apparent attempt to sidestep the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978, which sets strict limits on domestic government spying. In August of last year, under pressure from the administration to revise the existing law, Congress passed the Protect America Act (P.L. 110-55), which authorized expanded surveillance, but did not authorize the court that oversees the FISA program to ensure that any privacy protections were being implemented.
  The Senate is now considering new legislation to repair the problems of the Protect America Act, an effort in which Whitehouse has been deeply involved. Whitehouse's amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 2248) focuses on protections for Americans who are not the target of surveillance, but whose information or conversations may be incidentally intercepted during surveillance of a targeted person. In domestic law enforcement, there are clear, established procedures for ""minimizing"" the collection or retention of this information, to ensure that the privacy of innocent Americans is protected, and the prospect of judicial review is an important part of this protection. 
  S. 2248 gives the FISA Court the authority to approve minimization procedures, but says nothing about the Court's corresponding inherent authority, common to all courts, to review whether the procedures it has approved are being followed, and to order compliance. The Whitehouse amendment would repair that flaw by making clear that nothing in S. 2248 reduces or contravenes the FISA Court's inherent authority to enforce compliance with the Court-approved minimization procedures. 
  ""As a former U.S. attorney and Rhode Island attorney general who oversaw wiretaps and other surveillance procedures, I've seen that law enforcement officials are more likely to follow the rules when there is a strong prospect of judicial oversight,"" Whitehouse said. ""It makes no sense to limit the court's inherent authority to see whether rules it has approved are being followed, and to enforce compliance with these approved rules. It is not up to the executive branch to grade its own exams. That is a job for the courts.""

WHITEHOUSE, DURBIN CALL FOR WATERBOARDING INVESTIGATION
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in a letter to two Justice Department watchdog offices today to request an investigation into the role of Justice Department officials in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both senators are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
  ""Despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal, certain Justice Department officials, operating behind a veil of secrecy, concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful,"" the senators wrote. ""The Justice Department's continued refusal to repudiate waterboarding does tremendous damage to America's values and image in the world and places Americans at risk of being subjected to waterboarding by enemy forces. We believe it merits investigation to determine if these grievous results were the product of legal theories violating the Department's professional standards, or improper influence violating the Department's standards for independent legal advice."" 
  Last year, Whitehouse asked Judge Michael B. Mukasey, then the Bush administration's nominee to be Attorney General, whether the practice of waterboarding is torture or is constitutional. Mukasey's failure to state definitively that waterboarding is torture led Whitehouse to vote against his nomination, and Whitehouse has since joined a series of efforts by Senator Durbin and other Judiciary Committee Democrats to press the Attorney General to reassess its conclusion that the practice is legal. In a hearing last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Whitehouse is a member, General Michael Hayden, director of the CIA, publicly acknowledged for the first time that the U.S. government had used waterboarding during interrogations of several detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed.

  Washington, D.C. 20530
   Dear Inspector General Fine and Counsel Jarrett:
  We request that you investigate the role of Justice Department officials in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Attorney General Michael Mukasey refuses to investigate the Administration's authorization and use of waterboarding. CIA Director Michael Hayden has testified that the CIA waterboarded three detainees, and Attorney General Mukasey has testified that, ""There are circumstances where waterboarding is clearly unlawful."" Nonetheless, the Attorney General refused Senator Durbin's request to investigate because he does ""not believe such an investigation is necessary, appropriate, or legally sustainable."" 
   Attorney General Mukasey admitted that, ""the CIA sought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department informed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the circumstances and within the limits and the safeguards of the program."" The Attorney General's justification for refusing to open an investigation is that, ""no one who relied in good faith on the Department's past advice should be subject to criminal investigation for actions taken in reliance on that advice."" However, this does not address Senator Durbin's request that ""a Justice Department investigation should explore whether waterboarding was authorized and whether those who authorized it violated the law"" (our emphasis).
   Waterboarding has a sordid history in the annals of torture by repressive regimes, from the Spanish Inquisition to the Khmer Rouge. The United States has always repudiated waterboarding as a form of torture and prosecuted it as a war crime. The Judge Advocates General, the highest-ranking attorneys in each of the four military services, have stated unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal and violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
   Yet, despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal, certain Justice Department officials, operating behind a veil of secrecy, concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful. We believe it is appropriate for you to investigate the conduct of these Justice Department officials. As you know, a similar investigation is underway regarding Justice Department officials who advised the National Security Agency that its warrantless surveillance program is lawful.
   To restore the faith of our intelligence professionals and the American people in the Justice Department's ability to provide accurate and honest legal advice, we request that you make your findings public. 
   We ask that you explore, among other things:
   Did Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful perform legal work that meets applicable standards of professional responsibility and internal Justice Department policies and standards? For example, did these officials consider all relevant legal precedents, including those that appear to contradict directly their conclusion that waterboarding is lawful? Did these officials consult with government attorneys who are experts in the relevant legal standards, e.g. Judge Advocates General who are experts in the Geneva Conventions? Was it reasonable to rely on standards found in areas such as health care reimbursement law in evaluating interrogation techniques? 
   Were Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful insulated from outside pressure to reach a particular conclusion? What role did White House and/or CIA officials play in deliberations about the lawfulness of waterboarding? 
  We agree with Attorney General Mukasey that our intelligence professionals should be able to rely in good faith on the Justice Department's legal advice. However, if CIA agents or contractors have been put in jeopardy by misguided counsel from the Justice Department, including legal opinions that the Administration has been forced to repudiate, and as a result they risk war crimes prosecution overseas, this is a serious matter. It also places CIA agents at risk of receiving similarly flawed advice in the future. Moreover, the Justice Department's continued refusal to repudiate waterboarding does tremendous damage to America's values and image in the world and places Americans at risk of being subjected to waterboarding by enemy forces. We believe it merits investigation to determine if these grievous results were the product of legal theories violating the Department's professional standards, or improper influence violating the Department's standards for independent legal advice. 
  We respectfully request that you inform us whether you plan to initiate a review as soon as possible, and no later than February 19, 2008. We also request that you inform us whether the results of your review will be provided to Congress and made public. Thank you for your time and consideration.
   Sincerely,
   Richard J. Durbin 
  Sheldon Whitehouse

WHITEHOUSE: AMERICA HAS CALLED ON PRESIDENT TO BRING TROOPS HOME
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made the following remarks on the Senate floor this morning. The following is as delivered:
   Mr. President, the American people have demanded a new direction in Iraq, and the momentum building toward that change is strong. It is not difficult to understand why. 
   More than 3,600 brave American troops have lost their lives. Tens of thousands have returned home gravely injured - gravely injured. The war now costs Americans $10 billion every month in Iraq, with total spending now exceeding that of the Vietnam war. It has ruined our international standing. 
   Despite all this, little has changed on the ground. Violence has worsened. Sectarian fighting goes on virtually unabated, with deadly attacks taking a severe and relentless toll. While courageous Americans die, Iraqi politicians argue and stall.  
   Leaving U.S. troops caught in the morass of Iraq has not made that country more secure and, more important, it does not make our country more secure. To stay President Bush's course will continue to cost our men and women in uniform their lives and their physical and mental health. It will continue to drain our national Treasury and further erode what little good will remains for America around the world. It will leave our military with overstrained troops, overstressed families, and equipment and resources in disrepair. We are breaking our military in Iraq. 
   It is time for a change. The American people know this. Democrats and, to their credit, many Republicans in this Congress know this. Anyone who is listening or looking with clear eyes knows this. Yet after years of misjudgments, years of misleading slogans, years of misplaced priorities, and years of failure, this President still refuses to do what he must do: Change course in Iraq and bring our courageous American troops home. 
   Just the other day, the President reasserted his intention to stay the course, to continue this war indefinitely, an open-ended commitment, a blank check, with no prospects for redeployment or a new direction. Again, President Bush has failed to listen to the millions of Americans who have called on him and who have called on us to bring the war to an end. Enough is enough. It is time for a change. 
   Mr. President, a Member of this body recently said this about our Nation's course in Iraq: 
   In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved. Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long-term. 
   I happen to agree with those words spoken by the very distinguished Senator, Richard Lugar of Indiana, but what I like the most about them is the voice of reason and thoughtfulness they impart to this debate. There has been too little of that to date. The questions we face over this war in Iraq are serious questions, and they demand seriousness and reason from those who would grapple with them. Senator Lugar's statement reflects that thoughtfulness, reflects that reason, in the midst of a debate which has all too often been characterized by a lack of those characteristics. 
   Look at this administration, which too often communicates not with reason but with slogans and sound bites: ""Stay the course."" ""Global war on terror."" ""Cut and run."" ""Precipitous withdrawal."" People watching this continuing debate, mark when you hear the phrase ""precipitous withdrawal."" You are hearing the end of reason, and sloganeering. This is no service to the people of our country, not when serious and difficult problems must be solved. Just look where this slogan leadership has gotten us so far. It is a dishonor roll of failure: weapons of mass destruction, nonexistent; occupation planning, incompetence; reconstruction efforts, failed; the strain on our troops and their families, disabling; the treatment of our wounded troops, disgraceful; expenditures, massive; fraud, run rampant; the confidence of the American people, forfeited after cascades of false optimism and phony good news. 
   It is time, as Senator Lugar's words exemplify, to pursue intelligent, thoughtful, and realistic decisions about our course in Iraq, decisions that will protect our national interest. It is time to put the slogans away and thoughtfully extricate ourselves from a disastrous mess. 
   I hope we can take these steps forward in the Senate together. I am encouraged that several Republican friends have stated clearly that they cannot support the President's failed course in Iraq and are seeking real change. 
   As I have said many times in this Chamber, our strategy to effect change in Iraq requires the rapid and responsible redeployment of our troops. As I told the President directly when I met with him several months ago, I see the prospect of U.S. redeployment as the most powerful force at our disposal in this conflict now. That prospect of redeployment of American troops will eliminate the insurgents' argument that America is an occupying army, taking away from them a powerful recruiting tool for militant extremists. It will spur Iraq's political leaders to step forward, to quit slow-walking us through their own civil war and take responsibility for the security and governance of their own country. It will confront neighboring nations with a real impetus to assume more positive roles in assuring the region's stability. It will help restore the faith of the world in the leadership, the integrity, the good judgment, and the good will of our great country. 
   The President's surge plan is not the new direction Americans are calling for. It is a tactic - a tactic that can only be effective as part of a larger coherent strategy. And strategy, in turn, largely depends on whether the overarching dynamic works in America's favor. In this regard, America is presently on the worst possible footing. 
   A redeployment of our troops creates the potential to change this overarching dynamic for the better, freeing us to focus on more effective strategies to counter al-Qaida and to stabilize the region. Iraqi leaders will have to reach compromises with each other because their vision for their country's future will no longer be drawn with a major U.S. military presence in it. In the time it will take to bring our massive deployment of troops home, we can send a clear signal to Iraqi leaders and to Iraq's neighbors that America is standing down and it is time for them to stand up. We can help them do that. 
   This is a critical step, and thoughtful, reasoned, political, and diplomatic leadership will be essential to take advantage of the new dynamic a redeployment offers. I will confess that I am deeply troubled that this administration may not have the credibility it needs to accomplish this difficult task, even if it were of a mind to try. 
   This Congress can help set favorable conditions for executive action. We cannot legislate diligence, we cannot legislate thoughtfulness, we cannot legislate competence, and it is not clear that this administration is viewed as capable of those qualities any longer. It may take new faces and new voices to represent our country credibly in this process. Fortunately, there are many talented and accomplished people in this country whose perspectives and experience can help build America's credibility and prestige around the world. It will be a significant diplomatic challenge, but it presents a significant - perhaps historic - diplomatic opportunity. 
   That executive responsibility - the need to put ourselves in that diplomatic arena -- does not relieve us in the Senate of our duty to continue to press forcefully on behalf of the millions of Americans who demanded a change in Iraq, to apply reason, thought, and our best care and judgment to a problem that has not yielded to sloganeering. We will keep the pressure on this President and his administration, whose inability to admit failure is leading our precious Nation deeper and deeper into disaster in Iraq. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE: BUSH ADMINISTRATION STONEWALLING ON NEGOTIATING POWER FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today sharply questioned a senior Bush administration official over the administration's opposition to negotiating for lower prescription drug prices under the Medicare Part D program.  
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Michael O. Leavitt appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, on which Whitehouse sits, to discuss the administration's fiscal year 2008 budget request for federal health care programs. 
   ""As seniors confront skyrocketing prescription drug costs, it's extraordinarily frustrating that the Bush administration is unwilling to pursue the obvious remedy: lower drug prices through negotiation,"" Whitehouse said. 
   A vocal advocate for health care reform, Whitehouse has repeatedly called for Medicare to have the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices. Today, he cited a January report by Families USA showing that prices for the top drugs prescribed for seniors are 58 percent higher in Medicare drug plans than when offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). While the VA is permitted to negotiate with drug companies to get the best price for their beneficiaries, Medicare is prohibited by law from negotiating for lower drug prices under the current Part D program. 
   Whitehouse has heard from many Rhode Island seniors who were confused and frustrated by problems they experienced with Medicare Part D. As of last month, 38,400 seniors in Rhode Island who are eligible for prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D had not yet enrolled, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

WHITEHOUSE URGES SENATE TO PROHIBIT TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged the Senate to pass legislation banning torture. Below are Whitehouse's remarks as delivered.
  Mr. President, today's debate goes to the heart of what our country is, and what we wish it to be. By asking this: will the United States of America condone torture? Is there, at America's heart, a heart of darkness? 
  This authorization bill for America's intelligence community, offers us the opportunity to answer that question decisively. It contains a provision for which I have fought, for my initial amendment in Committee, and which I am proud to support today, that would prohibit members of the intelligence community from using any interrogation technique beyond those authorized in the Army Field Manual.
  By adopting this amendment, the two Intelligence Committees - Congress's experts on these matters - have sent a clear signal to America and to the world: that in this country the rule of law is our strongest bulwark against those who would do us harm. I hope that today, the Senate will have the confidence in our national values to reaffirm that signal, and pass this legislation with the Army Field Manual provision included. 
  Over the past several months, the American people have become all too familiar with the issue of torture. I want to discuss one technique in particular today:
  Waterboarding - or water torture, or the water cure - which dates back to the Spanish Inquisition of the 14th century. Waterboarding was a favorite of torturers, because its' terrible effects could be generated without the visible damage accompanying the rack, the screw, the iron, the whip or the gouge. It could be done over and over and over and over. 
  In the 20th century, waterboarding was done in the Philippines, where colonizers wielded it against indigenous peoples. It's been used in Sri Lanka, in Tunisia, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia - we are in the tradition of Pol Pot - by the French in Algeria, by the Japanese in World War II, and by military dictatorships in Latin America.
  The technique ordinarily involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, heels above head, putting a cloth over his face and pouring water over the cloth to simulate, to create, the feeling of suffocation and drowning. As I said, it leaves no marks on the body, but causes extreme physical and psychological suffering. 
  A French journalist, Henri Alleg, was subjected to this method of interrogation during the struggle for Algerian independence, and he wrote in his 1958 book The Question:
  I tried, by contracting my throat, to take in as little water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in my lungs for as long as I could. But I couldn't hold on for more than a few moments. I had the impression of drowning, and a terrible agony, that of death, took possession of me.
  Waterboarding is associated with criminal, tyrant, and repressive regimes, with rulers who sought from their captives not information but propaganda, meant for broadcast to friends or enemies whether true or false. Regimes that employed the technique of waterboarding generally did not do so to obtain information - rather, to obtain compliance. But no matter the purpose or the reason, its use was, and is, indefensible. 
  Water torture was not unknown to Americans. A 1953 article in the New York Times quotes Lt. Col. William Harrison of the U.S. Air Force, who said he was ""tortured with the 'water treatment' by Communist North Koreans."" In testimony before a U.S. military tribunal, Capt. Chase Jay Nielsen described being waterboarded by his Japanese captors following the 1942 Doolittle raid by U.S. aviators. 
  From all this, America's military knew there was a chance our servicemen and servicewomen could be subjected to water torture. The Defense Department established the SERE program: Survive, Evade, Resist, and Escape, to train select military personnel, who are at high risk of capture by enemy forces or isolation within enemy territory. 
  The program has also subjected certain service personnel to extreme interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, in an effort to prepare them for the worst: the possibility of capture and torture at the hands of a depraved or tyrannical enemy. According to Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor and chief of training at the U.S. Navy SERE school in San Diego: ""[O]ur training was designed to show how an evil totalitarian enemy would use torture at the slightest whim."" 
  Those who have experienced this technique, even at the hands of their own brothers in arms, are unequivocal about its effect. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who underwent waterboarding during SERE training, said this: ""As a human being, fear and helplessness are pretty overwhelming. ... this is not a discussion that Americans should ever be having. It is torture."" And our colleague in this body, Senator John McCain, has said the same.
  Yet it was to this relic of the dungeons of the Inquisition, of the Cambodian Killing Fields, and of the juntas of the southern hemisphere, that the Bush administration turned for guidance. I will speak later of how our Department of Justice came to approve this. But for now, we know just last week, in a stunning public admission, CIA Director General Michael Hayden admitted that the United States waterboarded three detainees following the September 11th attacks. The virus of waterboarding had traveled from tyrant regimes, through the SERE program, and infected America's body politic.
  Retired Brigadier General David Irvin of the U.S. Army Reserve, a former intelligence officer and instructor in interrogation, and Joe Navarro, an interrogator with the FBI, have recently written this:
  [T]here is considerable evidence that the CIA had to scramble after 9/11 to develop an interrogation program and turned to individuals with no professional experience in the field. ... Given the crisis atmosphere of the day, it is all too easy to believe the comment of an intelligence insider who said of the secret program to detain and interrogate al Qaeda suspects that ""quality control went out the window.""
  Don't let us jump out the window after it.
  America's military is expressly prohibited from using torture - because intelligence experts in our armed forces know that torture is an ineffective method of obtaining actionable intelligence. 
  Again I will speak later about the false assertion that this program was designed for eighteen year old novices. Some of the most sophisticated intelligence interrogations are done by our military after intense training. And, our military adheres to the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. At a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which I serve, I asked Col. Steven Kleinman, a 22-year veteran of interrogations, a senior intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserves and a veteran interrogator with plenty of experience overseas in the Middle East, about his experience conducting interrogations using the Army Field Manual. He said this: 
  I am not at all limited by the Army Field Manual in terms of what I need to do to generate useful information. ... I've never felt any necessity or operational requirement to bring physical, psychological or emotional pressure on a source to win their cooperation.
  A significant number of retired military leaders have written to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee saying:
  Interrogation methods authorized by the Field Manual have proven effective in eliciting vital intelligence from dangerous enemy prisoners. ... And the principles reflected in the Field Manual are values that no, no U.S. agency should violate.
  And General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces serving in Iraq, reiterated this point when he wrote last year to every soldier serving in the Iraq theater:
  Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. ...our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual, [section] (2-22.3) on Human Intelligence Collector Operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.
  That is the end of General Petraeus's quote.
  The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission emphatically agree. On Monday the chairmen, together with two former Secretaries of State, three former National Security Advisors and other national security experts, wrote that ""[c]ruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners under American control makes us less safe, violates our nation's values, and damages America's reputation in the world.""
  Torture is ineffective, it's wrong, and it's dangerous to all those who serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever be used by any person who represents the United States of America, or any agency that flies the American flag. 
  I was proud, last July, to introduce an amendment in the Intelligence Committee that would write this rule into law, and when that effort did not succeed, I was proud again, last winter, to support Senator Feinstein's amendment in conference. 
  I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation. We can journey no longer down Winston Churchill's ""stairway which leads to a dark gulf."" As Winston Churchill said, ""It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet.""
  The United States of America - the city on a hill, the light of the world, the promise of generations - must not ever condone torture. Torture breaks that promise, torture extinguishes that light, torture darkens that city. I hope that by our actions today, we in the Senate will help turn this country back toward our centuries-old promise. I hope we will turn towards the light. 
  I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE CRITICIZES JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ADVICE CONDONING TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse yesterday decried a decision by the Department of Justice to advise the CIA that the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" is legal, despite significant precedent in U.S. law showing the government had long considered the practice to be illegal.Below are Whitehouse's remarks as delivered.
   Mr. President, I want to follow the lead of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and my friend, the Senator from Illinois, and continue on this question with the determination the Government has made that waterboarding is legal.
   It is a question that matters so much to wary and watchful nations, disheartened and distrustful in the wake of 7 years of failed leadership and broken promises. It is also a question that matters immensely to the billions of men, women, and children around the globe who look to this country, the United States of America, as a beacon of light that shows the way nations ought to act and the way the world ought to be. It is a question that matters to the American people who are sick of asking: Is it wrong? and being told: Well, it depends. 
   The people of America still do not know how this came about-in particular, how the Department of Justice came to approve this sordid technique. I believe we are in a position where the concerns we have about torture overlap with some of the concerns we have had in this Chamber about the independence and integrity of the Department of Justice. Here is what we know.
   We know that Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said that ""the CIA sought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department informed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the circumstances and within the limits and safeguards of the program."" We know in 2002, John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel drafted a memo, later approved by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, which reads, in part:
   There is a significant range of acts that, though they might constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, failed to rise to the level of torture.
   As Evan Wallach of the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law has written:
   None of the Memo's analysis explains why waterboarding does not cause physical or psychological pain sufficient to meet the criminalization standards it enunciates.
   We have asked for further clarification, but in a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Mukasey refused to comment on the legality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in use and because of what he described as ""the absence of concrete facts and circumstances."" Even though the Department of Justice is now conducting an investigation into whether tape recordings of alleged waterboarding sessions were improperly destroyed, they would not look into whether the conduct on the tape was in and of itself improper.
   The argument is that no one who relies in good faith on the Department's past advice should be subject to criminal investigations for actions taken in reliance on that advice, which raises the question within the question: How did that advice come to be given in the first place?
   How did the best and brightest of the Department of Justice overlook the facts of the history of waterboarding prosecutions in which the United States was directly involved, and why was such guidance approved when contravening precedents appear clearly to be in evidence?
   Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the article written by Evan Wallach, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, entitled ""Drop by Drop: Forgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts."" The full cite is 45 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 468 (2007).
   Mr. President, the U.S. Government long considered waterboarding a form of torture, prosecutable as a war crime and punishable accordingly. This history includes war crimes prosecutions against Japanese soldiers who water boarded American aviators in World War II, the use of water torture by U.S. soldiers in the Philippines, and even an incident of waterboarding by a local sheriff prosecuted by the Department of Justice itself. Let me start with that.
   I am reading from the Wallach law review article in which it reports:
   In 1983, the Department of Justice affirmed that the use of water torture techniques was indeed criminal conduct under U.S. law.
   A sheriff in a Texas county waterboarded prisoners in order to extract confessions. Count one of the indictment asserted that the defendants conspired to-and this is a quote from the Department's own indictment - ""subject prisoners to a suffocating 'water torture' ordeal in order to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise indicate he was suffocating and/or drowning.""
   The sheriff and his deputies were all convicted by a jury under count one. It didn't end there. The case then went up on appeal, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a decision. I have in my hands United States of America v. Lee, 744 F.2d 1124, decided in 1984, in which they gave appellate review of these convictions.
   Finally, at sentencing, U.S. District Judge James DeAnda's comments, according to the article, were ""He told the former Sheriff that he had allowed law enforcement to fall into 'the hands of a bunch of thugs. The operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country.'"" That is the opinion of a U.S. district court judge at a sentencing on waterboarding.
   How is it that when the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel, were asked for their opinion, they were able to write this opinion? I have it in my hand. This is the unclassified version. It has been substantially redacted. Even so, it is 50 pages long - 50 pages long. They did 50 pages of legal research and could not find a U.S. Court of Appeals case in which the Department of Justice itself had brought the charges? Here is the case, United States v. Lee. It describes the facts:
   Lee was indicted along with two other deputies, Floyd Baker and James Glover, and the County Sheriff James Parker, based on a number of incidents in which prisoners were subjected to a ""water torture"" in order to prompt confessions to various crimes. 
  Throughout the rest of the opinion, these are referred to as ""torture"" and ""torture incidents.""
   All one has to have is Lexus or Westlaw and plug in the words ""water torture"" and find this case. How is it possible that the Office of Legal Counsel could not have found this? How is it possible that they could have also missed what the Columbia Law School was able to find - a telegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the Japanese Government objecting to the mistreatment of American prisoners, which included specifically waterboarding and describing the ""brutal and bestial methods of extorting alleged confessions""? That is our Secretary of State in an official communication to the Japanese Government describing, among other tortures, water tortures as brutal and bestial methods to extort alleged confessions. How could they not have found that? How could they not have found the charges the Senator from North Dakota referred to in which Japanese soldiers were brought up on charges in front of military tribunals-military tribunals staffed with American judges, military tribunals staffed with American prosecutors - for waterboarding American prisoners?
   Here are some examples. One of the Japanese officers was named Hata and the article describes the charges and specifications against Officer Hata, which included this:
   ... Hata did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils.
   Similarly, Hata did willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O. Cash and Monroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. .....
   The charge and specifications against Officer Asano were:
   Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils. .....
   Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O Cash and Munroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. .....
   The charge and specifications against Officer Kita were again, ""willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture John Henry Burton, an American Prisoner of War, by beating him and by forcing water into his nose.""
   Over and over the testimony describes exactly what we know as waterboarding. The charges and specifications by this tribunal staffed by American officers describe that they did willfully and unlawfully commit cruel, inhuman, and brutal acts and atrocities and other offenses, including strapping them to a stretcher and pouring water down their nostrils, by holding the prisoner's head back and forcing him to swallow a bucketful of sea water over and over and over.
   How could they have missed it? How could they have missed it? How could they miss the decision on point by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit?
   What else do we know about the Office of Legal Counsel? We know that the conditions there were pretty ripe for abuse. We know they were doing this in secret, protected from public scrutiny, protected from peer review, protected from critical analysis under the veil of secrecy, deep secrecy in which they were operating, coming up with the theories as they pleased, thinking they would never see the light of day. So they did not have to do their homework. Somebody might have done a little research and found the Fifth Circuit decision on point, but, no, they did not need to.
   It is part of a pattern because, as the Presiding Officer will recall, when I was offered the chance to read the secret Office of Legal Counsel opinions related to the warrantless wiretapping program, I went and took some notes, and when I got back here, I eventually was able to get them declassified. They described other interesting theories that grew in that hothouse of legal ideology, protected from the glare of public scrutiny, ideas such as the President is not obliged to follow Executive orders. He is not obliged to give anybody notice that he is violating Executive orders. He can live in a parallel universe in constant violation of his own Executive orders and nothing is wrong with that, other than, of course, the fact that it completely degrades and destroys the entire structure of Executive orders as a law function of the United States of America.
   Another argument is that under article II, the President's power as Commander in Chief, he has the authority to determine what his powers are. Think about that for a moment. They assert article II gives them the authority to decide what the scope of his article II powers are. I seem to remember a decision called Marbury v. Madison saying it is ""emphatically the province of the judicial department to decide what the law is.""
   The last one, my personal favorite, is that the Department of Justice is bound by the legal determinations of the President. It is a good thing that was not the case when President Nixon was the President and made the legal determination if the President does it, it doesn't violate the law.
   So what on Earth has been going on at the Office of Legal Counsel, an office that used to be distinguished for its probity, for its analysis, for its scholarship, an office on which the Department of Justice relies?
   Just as Americans rely on the Department of Justice to provide guidance in our Government, to provide a moral compass within the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be the place where they try to get it right. How could they try to get it right when they cannot even find a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on water torture when you are looking up whether it is illegal? If I were a partner in a law firm and a junior associate came to me with a memo such as this that had missed the case on point, do you think he would have much of a career? I don't think so. It is a fatal failure of legal analysis. And yet, where there is supposed to be the very best at the legal counsel of the Department of Justice, they missed all of it. If there has been a systematic breakdown in this institution of Government long known for probity and scholarship, if it has been captured and behind a veil of secrecy rendered a political ideological tool, that is a matter of very legitimate public concern.
   I am pleased to say Senator Durbin and myself have written to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice and to the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice to look into exactly that matter.
   I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience with me. I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for his patience.
   I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE
  The U.S. Senate today passed legislation banning the use of torture by U.S. interrogators, a measure cosponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, fought to include the provision in the House-Senate conference report, and praised today's vote as a clear sign that ""the strength of America is the force of its ideals."" 
  ""Torture is ineffective, unnecessary, andwrong, and it's dangerous to all those who serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever be used by any person who represents this country, or any agency that flies our flag, and this vote should ensure that it never will be,"" Whitehouse said. ""Now, President Bush must stand with us, and not with the torturers of the Khmer Rouge or the Inquisitors of Spain. I hope the President will sign this legislation and commit his administration to follow it.""
  Last week, General Michael Hayden, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), publicly admitted for the first time that the CIA had waterboarded three detainees while in U.S. custody. Waterboarding, or water torture, involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, putting a cloth over his face and pouring water over the cloth to create the feeling of suffocation and drowning. The technique causes extreme physical and psychological suffering and has been recognized as illegal torture by a number of U.S. courts and military tribunals, as well as under international law. 
  Despite this precedent, Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said the Department of Justice provided legal guidance to the CIA indicating that the use of waterboarding would be lawful. Mukasey has refused to comment on the legality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in use, and because of what he described as ""the absence of concrete facts and circumstances."" 
  Whitehouse was the principal sponsor of an amendment prohibiting torture in July, as part of legislation authorizing funding and setting policy for the CIA and other branches of the intelligence community. When that amendment failed in the Senate Intelligence Committee, Whitehouse joined Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and several others to try to add the amendment during House-Senate conference negotiations on the bill last December. That time, it passed, with the support of Congressman Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate voted today to approve the conference report; the House took a similar vote late last year.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement today on economic stimulus legislation that will provide $300-$600 in rebates to most households, including seniors living on Social Security. President Bush signed the bill into law this afternoon. 
  ""The economic stimulus bill signed by the President today will provide badly-needed help to hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders - people who, in tough economic times, have stretched their budgets to pay for gas, for home heating oil, for groceries, or for mortgage or rent payments. I'm pleased that this bill also includes assistance for the many seniors in our state who live on Social Security, and who were excluded from President Bush's original proposal.
  ""I'm going to monitor this process closely to help make sure seniors in our state have all the information they need to take advantage of this badly-needed help. Because for the thousands of Rhode Island seniors struggling every day just to get by, a little breathing room can make an enormous difference.""
  Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, wrote Senate leaders in January to push for the inclusion of seniors who rely on Social Security benefits in the stimulus package. Congress passed the measure last week.

  Rhode Island families at risk of high mortgage payments or foreclosure got some much-needed help in Washington today as the Senate approved legislation strengthening federal homeowners' insurance aimed at middle- and low-income homebuyers. With the security of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance, lenders can give reasonable mortgage rates to homebuyers who otherwise might be pushed into the subprime market.  
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) applauded the passage of the FHA Modernization Act of 2007 (S. 2338), which will help more working families afford to purchase or stay in their homes.
  ""For the millions of Americans working hard and saving to purchase a home, a risky sub-prime mortgage shouldn't be their only option,"" Whitehouse said. ""Expanding federal loan insurance will help bring their dream of homeownership closer to reality and will give existing homeowners more flexibility to refinance.""
  For months, declines in the housing market nationwide have led to a dramatic increase in foreclosures rates, particularly among low- and middle-income homeowners with subprime mortgage loans. A June 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that as the market for subprime loans has grown, FHA's market share has fallen, particularly among minority borrowers - meaning that fewer and fewer homeowners are benefiting from stable, secure federal homeowners insurance. In Rhode Island, the number of FHA-backed loans dropped from 3,085 in 2001 to just 481 in 2005 - an 85 percent decline. 
  S. 2338, which passed 93 to 1, will expand both minimum and maximum loan levels and simplify downpayment requirements to make Federal Housing Administration loan insurance available to more working families. The bill will also increase access to post-purchase homeownership counseling for low- and moderate-income homeowners having difficulty making their mortgage payments; remove caps on certain ""reverse mortgages,"" which allow seniors to convert the equity in their homes into cash; and create a pilot program aimed at broadening access to credit for borrowers without sufficient credit histories at traditional credit bureaus.
  Whitehouse is a cosponsor of several other measures to address the mortgage crisis, including: the Mortgage Disclosure Act of 2007 (S. 2153), introduced by Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.), which would strengthen mortgage disclosure standards for consumer mortgages to ensure subprime borrowers know their payments could increase substantially; the Home Ownership Preservation and Protection Act of 2007 (S. 2452), introduced by Senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), which would prohibit a number of unscrupulous lending practices and give homeowners in default of their mortgages new tools to stave off foreclosure; and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act (S. 2136), introduced by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), which would give homeowners new leverage in staving off foreclosure and keeping their homes in the event of bankruptcy.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) congratulated the Island Moving Company of Newport, Rhode Island, on a $10,000 federal grant to support its 2008 Open for Dancing festival. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) issued the award as part of its ""Challenge America: Reaching Every Community Fast-Track Review Grants"" program.  
  ""While many school districts have been struggling to protect arts programming from budget cuts, the Company has worked extensively in schools, teaching creative movement annually to 2,000 Rhode Island students, some of whom are low-income and may not otherwise have access to arts enrichment programs,"" Whitehouse, a member of the NEA's Council on the Arts, wrote in a letter in support of the program's grant proposal in July. 
  The Island Moving Company, the only professional performing troupe based in Newport, works extensively with young people in schools in the area, where 47% of the school-aged population is classified as low-income. The Open for Dancing festival provides students and other area residents interested in dancing the opportunity to take part in a unique performance that highlights not only the art of dance, but also historic Newport landmarks. 
  Open for Dancing 2008 will take place September 17-21, 2008, at Newport locations to be determined by guest choreographers in May. Sites all over historic Newport have hosted performances in the past, including the Preservation Society of Newport, Doris Duke's Rough Point, Fort Adams, Ballard Park, Trinity Church, the Newport Art Museum, the Newport Historical Society and the Navy Base. Truly a local event, festival partners include the City of Newport, the Visitors Bureau and Salve Regina University. 
  ""Artistic Director Miki Ohlsen and I are thrilled to gain this recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts and to have the Senator's strong support,"" said Dominique Alfandre, Executive Director of the IMC. ""Open for Dancing is an event for the whole community, involving both students and community participants in the creation of original dance works for stunning Newport sites. It is a celebration of Newport's historic landscapes and its lively cultural life.""

  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Wednesday, March 14, called on the Senate to pass a budget resolution that funds America's true priorities, from health care for children to assistance with home energy costs to higher education to care for veterans. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse spoke at a hearing to begin consideration of the resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008, announced on Wednesday by Chairman Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).

""I look forward to working to pass a budget that restores fairness to the process and puts America's working families first."" 
   The full text of Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.  
   Statement of Sheldon Whitehouse 
   Opening Statement: Senate Budget Committee Markup 
   March 14, 2006 
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to address the budget resolution, and for your unyielding commitment to a budget that funds America's true priorities. 
   Over the past two years, I've traveled across Rhode Island talking with middle-class families, people who work hard and play by the rules... but still, too often, struggle just to get by. I will never forget their voices, or their stories - because in this Committee and in this Congress, they are the ones we should be fighting for. They are the ones Chairman Conrad is fighting for, in the budget he will present to us today. 
   But too often this President ignores the struggles of everyday people. Instead of heeding the voices of working Americans and sending this Committee a budget that puts their priorities first, the President's budget once again serves the wealthiest Americans - at the expense of those who need our help the most. 
   I've met families in Rhode Island who were struggling to pay for health care. We have programs like SCHIP, to help make sure low-income children and others can get the health care coverage they need. SCHIP is vital to our state, as well as many others, and I join my senior senator, Jack Reed - a true leader on this issue - in the fight to make sure this initiative has the funding it needs. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, inadequate funding for SCHIP in the President's proposed budget would cause 1.4 million children and pregnant women to lose their health care coverage over the next five years. 1.4 million children and pregnant women would lose their health care coverage over the next five years under this President's budget. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   There are families in Rhode Island who can barely afford to heat their homes in winter. Again, Senator Jack Reed has been a champion for the LIHEAP program, which helps lower-income families pay for home energy costs, and it is a key priority for me as well. The President's budget would cut the LIHEAP program by $420 million, compared to the 2007 level adjusted for inflation. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   Too many seniors in my state can't afford prescription drugs. We know giving Medicare the power to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices, just as the VA does, can save money - lots of money - but the President won't consider it. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   Many young people in the Ocean State are already having difficulty paying for college. Rhode Island's great Senator Claiborne Pell believed the federal government should do more to bring higher education within reach for more Americans. The President pays lip service to this vital program, but refuses to fully fund it - while at the same time proposing cuts to other initiatives that also help young people afford the high cost of a college education. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better.  
   I've met veterans in Rhode Island, at American Legion posts, at senior centers, at Fourth of July and Memorial Day parades, and at our many community dinners in towns all over the state. They served in our nation's wars from World War II to Vietnam to Iraq, and they wanted us to hear the infuriating truth: that we are failing to support our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The President wants veterans to pay billions of dollars in fees for the health care they depend on, without a significant increase in funding for veterans' health programs. That's the wrong priority for America. We can do better. 
   And we can do better as we work to repair our broken and dysfunctional health care system, which despite the best doctors, the best nurses, and the best technology, produces some of the worst health care outcomes due to bureaucratic inefficiency and avoidable medical errors. I believe we can expand health coverage to more Americans, improve quality, and save money, through the use of health information technology and quality reform, and Senator Stabenow and I will have more to say about that tomorrow. 
   Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the aisle share so many common values. We believe access to affordable health care should be a right for everyone, not a privilege for the few. We believe in upholding America's promise of retirement security for our seniors. We believe it's more important to guarantee our children a great education for their futures than to guarantee the wealthiest Americans bigger and bigger tax cuts today. And we believe our veterans deserve the care and benefits they've earned - not lost paperwork and mold-infested rooms. 
   But this President's inept management and poor choices have submerged our nation in fiscal quicksand - and now threaten our values and priorities. This latest budget, like the President's budgets of the past six years, present a disgraceful consignment of debt to our children and grandchildren. This leaves America with few good options, and many tough choices. 
   The budget we pass this week will not do everything we want to do. It will not solve every challenge, or meet every need. But let me be clear: it was this President who put tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans before health care coverage for every American. It was this President who chose deepening deficits and, in the words of our chairman, a ""wall of debt,"" over fiscal discipline. It is this President who wants to send tens of thousands more Americans to Iraq rather than care for them when they return home. We cannot repair all this damage in a day, or in a year, or even in a Congress. But we can begin. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, let us begin. I am so thankful for your leadership. Your expertise is second to none. Your courtesy to the minority side is lost on no one, least of all this new senator. And your commitment to an America disciplined in its finances and strong in its values is the right example to set for your colleagues, and the right message to send to the world. I look forward to working with you in the days ahead to pass a budget that restores fairness to the process and puts America's working families first.

WHITEHOUSE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT PASSES IN BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
  The Senate Budget Committee on Thursday, March 15, unanimously adopted a bipartisan measure proposed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) supporting the adoption of modern health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wisc.), Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), and Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) cosponsored the measure, which was reported to the full Senate this afternoon as part of the Senate budget resolution.  
   ""America has the best doctors, nurses, and technology in the world, but too often, the poorest health outcomes due to bureaucratic inefficiencies and avoidable medical errors,"" said Whitehouse. ""We need to invest more in health IT, and this is a good first step."" As Attorney General of Rhode Island, Whitehouse founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a collaborative effort between health care providers, insurers, and government to lower costs and find innovative solutions to our health care crisis. 
   A 2001 Institute of Medicine report found that health ""information technology can contribute to a reduction in avoidable medical errors by standardizing and automating certain decisions, and by aiding in the identification of possible errors, such as potential adverse drug interactions, before they occur."" Many public health technology applications ""are within technical reach at a relatively low cost, but are not widely used because of a lack of targeted public-sector funding."" 
   According to a study published in Health Affairs, only 15-20% of physician offices, and 20-25% of hospitals, had electronic medical record systems as of 2005. By even the most conservative estimate, effective electronic medical record implementation and networking could eventually save more than $81 billion annually, $23 billion of which would accrue annually to the Medicare program. 
   The Whitehouse-Stabenow amendment creates a reserve fund to accommodate legislation that provides incentives or other support for adoption of modern information technology to improve quality and protect privacy in health care, or for payments that are based on adherence to accepted clinical protocols identified as best practices. 
   Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the bill. The Whitehouse-Stabenow measure is deficit-neutral, specifying that health IT or best-practices legislation could not increase the deficit over a five-year period.

REED, WHITEHOUSE SEEK PERMANENT BLOCK ON LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TERMINAL FUNDING
  Rhode Island's Senators have asked appropriators to permanently block funding for a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility that would risk serious damage to Rhode Island's waterways and coastal communities, the senators announced today. 
   In a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Senators Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D) asked that the Energy and Water appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 include language stipulating that ""[n]o funds made available by this or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used to take any action to approve or allow the construction of any liquefied natural gas facility to be located within the City of Fall River, Massachusetts."" Senators Edward Kennedy (D) and John Kerry (D), both of Massachusetts, also signed the letter.  
   ""LNG tankers serving Weaver's Cove would pass by several Rhode Island towns and cities and along miles of populated coastline, putting thousands of Rhode Islanders at risk,"" stated Reed. ""It is essential that we take into consideration the safety of citizens while balancing the long-term, regional energy needs of New England. I am pleased that the Coast Guard voiced its concern last week over the Weaver's Cove proposal. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that plans to build this LNG facility are put on hold."" 
   ""Tankers full of liquid natural gas running through Narragansett Bay pose an immense security, environmental, and safety risk that Rhode Islanders just can't afford,"" Whitehouse said. ""I am dedicated to fighting to prevent this facility from harming Rhode Island's precious marine economy and environment."" 
   The proposed LNG facility would be located on a 73-acre site within Fall River, a dense urban area with a population estimated by the Census Bureau at nearly 100,000 people. To reach the proposed facility, tankers would be required to navigate 21 nautical miles through Narragansett Bay and other navigationally-challenging, inland waterways. 
   In a May 9 letter to Weaver's Cove Energy, Roy A. Nash, captain of the Coast Guard's port for Southern New England, wrote that the company's proposal failed to verify that ""smaller LNG tankers can be safely navigated through this waterway on a consistent, repeatable basis.""

   Dear Chairman Dorgan and Senator Domenici: 
   Thank you for your consideration of our Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water Development appropriations requests. We respectfully request you consider this additional priority to include bill language within the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) account to prevent the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Fall River, Massachusetts. 
   The proposed facility would be located in a densely populated urban area and would receive LNG in large vessels after those ships make their way through 21 nautical miles of navigationally challenging inland waterways, including through the Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island), Mount Hope Bay, and the Taunton River. This route will require several complex navigational maneuvers in order to pass under the bridges in the area. In fact, the Coast Guard has already concluded that ""extraordinary maneuvers"" would be required, leaving no margin for navigational error, and the company's transit plan appears unsuitable in its current state. 
   The project has strong bipartisan opposition including former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, current Governor Deval Patrick, and Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri. Unfortunately, FERC did not take these concerns into consideration during the Federal LNG siting process. Therefore, we respectfully request you include the following language that is narrowly drafted to prevent only this facility from being constructed: 
   No funds made available by this or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used to take any action to approve or allow the construction of any liquefied natural gas facility to be located within the City of Fall River, Massachusetts. 
   If your staff have any questions or need any additional information, please call Jay McCarthy of Senator Kennedy's staff (4-2379) or John Phillips of Senator Kerry's staff (4-3095). 
   Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today congratulated Brown University on its receipt of a $10 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to conduct research on the quality of long-term health care in this country.  
  ""Long-term care is a critical part of our health care infrastructure, improving the lives of millions of Americans every day. This grant represents not only an awareness of the importance of long-term care services in our aging society, but also a strong commitment to improving these services moving forward,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Aging Committee. ""I'm proud that Brown University will have the chance to continue Rhode Island's leading role in improving the quality of health care across the country."" 
  The $10 million award, allocated over five years, will support a research project by Brown's Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research to collect data on insurance reimbursement claims, hospitalizations, the health of long-term care facility residents, relevant state policies and a myriad of other topics from nursing homes all over America. When completed, Brown's comprehensive database will be a powerful tool to assist policymakers as they assess ways to improve the quality of Americans' health care.
  Whitehouse has worked to improve the quality of health care through his career in public service. As Rhode Island's Attorney General, he founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a collaborative effort between health care providers, insurers, and government that has spearheaded initiatives to expand the use of electronic health records and promote evidence-based reforms. 
  In the Senate, Whitehouse has introduced legislation aimed at encouraging health quality reforms, building a national health information technology infrastructure, and linking health care payments to health care quality. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Whitehouse succeeded in offering an amendment to Congress's fiscal year 2008 budget resolution creating a reserve fund for the adoption of modern health information technology.

   Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of thousands of Rhode Islanders who have talked with me about the need for a new direction in Iraq and the need to bring our troops home. 
   I speak on behalf of the veterans' families who traveled here to Washington to speak to me about their memories of war and the need for this one to end. 
   I speak on behalf of the brave men and women serving in Iraq who have sacrificed so much and whose families anxiously await their return. 
   I speak on behalf of mothers I met who felt they had to buy body armor for their sons and daughters headed for Iraq because they could not trust this administration to provide what was needed. 
   The Senate may have been muzzled in recent days, but Rhode Islanders certainly have not been. More than 2,000 of them have reached out to my office in frustration, in anger, and in concern -- and in the hope that this new Democratic Senate will listen to them and hear them, as this administration will not. 
   I want to share some of what they have written me: 
   I was at Michael Weidemann's funeral. 
   Mr. President, Michael was a 23-year-old Army sergeant from Newport, killed in an IED blast in Anbar Province last November. 
   The letter continues: 
   Please, if nothing else, take care of things, so that we do not have to go through what we went through at that funeral. Michael and my son...were in the JROTC together....He is on his second tour of Iraq. Please, don't make yesterday a dress rehearsal for me. I want my son to come home, safely. 
   From Johnston, Rhode Island: 
   My son...is presently serving in Iraq and on his second tour of duty there....The President's plan ignores the American people who voted for change in November, and who continue to demand we bring our troops home....The people made their voice heard, and if the President isn't going to listen, the Democratic Congress will. The President's policies have failed! 
   From Portsmouth, Rhode Island: 
   President Bush has ignored the advice of experience, lied to us all, lacked any plan and seems to be expecting his successor to solve the problems. It is our only hope that you, as a member of Congress, can work toward bringing our troops home soon. 
   From Kingston: 
   I am appalled at the loss of life -- today it was reported 20 more service people were killed. The Kurds are deserting rather than fight in Baghdad....We are not just losing people, we are losing big money. We have seven grandchildren. What kind of debt are we placing on those future generations? 
   From Warwick: 
   We never should have begun this war, let's now have the sense to end it, not prolong it. Please do whatever you can to stop the president's initiative to increase our military presence in Iraq...., to spend even more money waging a war that your constituents have indicated they no longer support. 
   From North Kingstown: 
   We are looking to you to do whatever is in your power to stop the U.S. escalation of troops in Iraq. I and many in our nation feel this will only make a bad situation worse, widen what is essentially a civil war and lead to further casualties and costs without contributing towards a political solution....We are counting on you and your colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and be counted and forge a bipartisan solution to end this war. 
   And finally, a woman from Cumberland forwarded me a message she sent to President Bush: 
   My nephew...is in the 82nd Airborne serving our country in Iraq. He is the bravest person I have ever known, along with all the other men and women serving this country. I am proud to be an American! Please, please, on behalf of my family and the families of all U.S. troops -- bring them home now! 
   Mr. President, these voices will not be unfamiliar to anyone in this body. In every State, we have heard similar voices. You have heard them in Colorado, Mr. President. My friend, Senator Sanders, has heard them in Vermont. People all across America are speaking to all of us, and it is time for us to listen and to show that we have heard and to start to bring our soldiers home. 
   The President has not heard these voices. He wants to send tens of thousands more troops to Iraq. He calls this a surge. We consider it a grave mistake. 
   Tomorrow, our vote can stop the parliamentary maneuvers that have stalled us, and this great deliberative body can begin to debate the most pressing question of this day. 
   Let's talk for a moment about that question. The other side wishes to debate every question, any question -- any question but the escalation by this President of our troops in Iraq by over 21,000 men and women. But this question we want to debate is not a question selected by Democrats for political reasons. It is possible here to choose self-serving questions and to force a debate on those questions just to make a political point. But we have not done that. 
   This question, whether to escalate the war in Iraq, is not an invention of the Democratic Party. It is not an invention of the Senate. It is President Bush, who proposed to send tens of thousands more troops into harm's way and to escalate this conflict, who has presented this question. This question is what was presented to us by President George W. Bush, and by him alone, and it is the pressing question of today. 
   For weeks, we on this side of the aisle have emphasized and reemphasized our strong commitment to having a real debate -- a debate to a vote -- to telling the American people where we stand and to casting our votes on the precise question the President of the United States has presented to America. But we have been impeded, obstructed, maneuvered away from this critical question. 
   The other side argues that to dispute this President's judgment is to fail to support the troops -- even though that judgment has failed the troops and has failed our country and has left us with few good options. But that is a false choice, Mr. President. And this hour demands better of this institution. 
   There are ways to accomplish the change America demands, and that reason and good conscience dictate. For instance, I believe that rather than send a single additional American soldier into the sands and marshes of Iraq, this President can announce clearly and unequivocally that our troops will be redeployed from Iraq and will soon come home. 
   The most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is the prospect of our redeployment out of Iraq. Let me repeat that. The most powerful motivating force at our country's disposal today is the prospect of redeployment out of Iraq. Using this power wisely, deftly, and thoughtfully would accomplish three critical objectives that, as I have said, would make great strides toward security in Iraq and stability in the region. 
   First, a clear statement of our intent to redeploy our troops from Iraq would eliminate the sense there that we are an Army of occupation. This in turn would quiet the nationalist sentiment of the Iraqi people, now aroused against us. Many Iraqis are now so opposed to our presence they think killing American soldiers is acceptable. 
   Second, without America's intervening presence, the world community would have to face directly the consequences of the situation in Iraq. The prospect of our departure would compel the world to take a more active role to work together with America to bring peace and stability to the region. We cannot continue as we are now, in every meaningful way completely alone. 
   Third, Iraq's neighbors will be obliged to assume greater responsibility for averting the risk of a Sunni-Shiite conflict igniting in Iraq and spreading beyond Iraq's borders. Without us in Iraq as a police force for a civil war, neighboring nations will have an enlivened incentive to avert a wider war. 
   Finally, the Bush administration's preoccupation with Iraq leaves us weakened in our capability to address other obligations around the world, from the changing situation in North Korea, to the ongoing battle for Afghanistan, to the serious threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. 
   Mr. President, these are serious matters, and they deserve the serious and sustained attention of the Senate. I hope tomorrow's vote will allow us to bring this question that attention. 
   Mr. President, I will support that vote tomorrow. I ask other Senators, who hear our fellow Americans' genuine and sincere concern about our national interest, will do the same. 
   I will support not only the resolution disapproving of the President's escalation plan and supporting our troops, but also other, stronger measures that will follow, and that will continue to put pressure on this administration to finally bring our troops home. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Floor Statement for Sheldon Whitehouse (as prepared for delivery) 
   On Ending the War in Iraq 
   May 16, 2007 
   Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because more than three thousand of our men and women have lost their lives, and tens of thousands more have returned home wounded - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because hundreds of billions of America's tax dollars have been sunk into the sands and marshes of Iraq, with much of that funding lost to waste, fraud, or abuse by those who have neither Iraq's nor America's best interests at heart - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because the public record of this conflict - reflected in the many retired generals who have spoken out against the conduct of the war, and the many books and articles chronicling its planning and execution - reveals catastrophic mistakes and misjudgments that have raised serious questions about this administration's capacity for leadership - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because that same administration misused and distorted intelligence, arguing that America should go to war on the basis of information that proved to be untrue or highly misleading - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because despite the millions of Americans who joined together to call for a new direction in Iraq, this President chose to escalate the conflict - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because the President and Vice President and their allies would rather pick a political fight with this Congress, using false rhetoric like ""micromanage"" and ""precipitous withdrawal,"" than answer tough questions from the American people - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   Because the prospect of our troops' redeployment is the single most powerful force at our disposal, to galvanize unity and cooperation among the Iraqi factions and effect real change - American troops must come home from Iraq. 
   And because even after all this, this President still refuses to listen to the American people and stubbornly fails to give this country the change of course it demands - it is up to this Congress to act to bring American troops home from Iraq. 
   Some claim this strategy is risky. But the greater risk by far, Mr. President, would be to fail to seize the opportunity a redeployment of our troops presents us. 
   To announce clearly to the world that American troops will soon leave Iraq will change the dynamic there in a positive way. 
   It will give us the chance to renew and rebuild diplomatic ties in the region and around the world that have been so badly damaged by this President and this President's war, and restore America's prestige and standing amongst our friends. 
   It will send a signal to the insurgents who foment violence in Iraq that they will no longer be able to use the United States military as a recruiting tool for extremists, and it will motivate efforts by the Iraqis to secure and stabilize their nation. 
   It will give the Iraqis the impetus to step forward and do the things our military leaders say they must do for the surge to succeed - passing the hydro-carbon law to allow equal sharing of oil revenues among all Iraqis, and measures to facilitate provincial elections, for example. 
   It will give us the time and resources to restore our extraordinary military to the strength and level of readiness our troops deserve. 
   And it will give us the freedom and resources to look to the many challenges that still confront us here at home - from soaring gas prices to a broken health care system. 
   But to achieve all these things, we must take the first step. We must make it clear that we will bring our troops home from Iraq. 
   Mr. President, the measure offered by Senator Feingold with the support of the distinguished Majority Leader is a smart, responsible, and effective step to repair what the President has left broken. It would require the President to redeploy our troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008. After that date, funds would only be available for three specific, limited purposes: targeted counterterrorism operations; protecting U.S. infrastructure and personnel; and training and equipping Iraqi security forces. 
   This plan gives our troops in the field the resources they need today - and it gives them a strategy worthy of their service as they look to tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid amendment, and I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE AGAIN SPEAKS OUT FOR CHANGE IN IRAQ
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) again urged President Bush to change course in Iraq in a speech on the Senate floor earlier today. Last week, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, along with a delegation of members that traveled to Iraq last month, met privately with President Bush in the Oval Office and shared his frustration at the President's failure to seek a new direction in the now four-year-old war. 
   ""The question of what to do in Iraq is not a political fight between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress,"" Whitehouse said. ""It's a struggle between the President and the will of the American people. It's long past time their voices were heard."" 
   Whitehouse traveled to Iraq in mid-March as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. While in the country, he met with U.S. troops, including Rhode Islanders stationed in Fallujah; American military commanders, including General David Petraeus; and high-ranking Iraqi officials.  
   Whitehouse joined a majority in the Senate to pass critical war funding legislation that would support U.S. forces in Iraq and compel President Bush to begin redeployment of American troops from Iraq within four months, with a goal of having all combat troops out of Iraq by March 31, 2008. Whitehouse is also a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that will limit funding for the war after April 2008 to counter-terrorism operations, training, and force protection. 
   Whitehouse began his remarks with an expression of sorrow at yesterday's horrific shooting at Virginia Tech. ""We may never know why it happened,"" said Whitehouse. ""What we know for certain is that in our shared grief, we will find shared resolve: to care for the wounded, comfort the families and friends of those who died, support the University and its community, and search for answers, in hope that this tragedy may never be repeated.""

   Floor Statement of Sheldon Whitehouse 
   On the War in Iraq 
   April 17, 2007 
   Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as I come to the floor this morning to share my concerns about this country's disastrous policies in Iraq, our nation is mourning the unimaginable loss of 32 people in the tragic and senseless shootings at Virginia Tech. 
   The thoughts and prayers of every American are with the victims of this horrific act, the deadliest shooting episode this country has ever seen. 
   We are only just beginning to learn exactly what happened yesterday - and we may never know why it happened. 
   What we know for certain is that in our shared grief, we will find shared resolve: to care for the wounded, comfort the families and friends of those who died, support the University and its community, and search for answers, in hope that this tragedy may never be repeated. 
   I've been a member of the Senate now for just over 100 days. I'm here, and many of my freshmen colleagues are here, because the people of Rhode Island, along with millions of other people across this country, looked at the war in Iraq and saw something that needed to change. 
   They saw hundreds of billions of dollars spent, much of it wasted on reconstruction contracts that were sloppily-managed or ill-advised. They saw one after another in a succession of retired generals protesting the failed strategy in Iraq and arguing for a different course. They saw reports that the Bush administration had misused and politicized our national intelligence services, to press a case for war that did not exist. They read books chronicling a heartbreaking series of mistakes and misjudgments. And they saw tens of thousands of American soldiers returning home grievously injured - and more than three thousand men and women who will never return. 
   The country saw one of the greatest foreign policy disasters in our nation's history, and demanded a new direction. The American people voted for change. They were sincere, sober, and correct in their judgment, and this new Congress listened - but President Bush did not. Instead of committing to redeploy our troops from Iraq, the President chose to escalate the conflict. And now, instead of working with this new Congress to forge a new strategy worthy of the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, the President and Vice President are on the attack - not against the Iraqi leaders slow-walking us through the conflict, but against the American people who have rightly questioned their failing policy. 
   The question is this: how much longer will the President refuse to listen? 
   Since joining the Senate just over 100 days ago, I've worked to put pressure on the Bush Administration to redeploy our troops from Iraq. In mid-March, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I traveled to Iraq to get a firsthand look at the situation on the ground, see the hard work of our dedicated troops, and talk with our military commanders and Iraqi political officials. 
   In Baghdad, our delegation met with several of the officers leading America's military engagement in Iraq, including General David Petraeus, Lt. General Raymond Odierno, and Lt. General Martin Dempsey, as well as members of our U.S. Embassy country team. We also met with Mahmud al-Mashhadani, speaker of the Iraqi parliament, and National Security Minister Shirwan al-Waili. In my capacity as a member of the Committee, I also met members of our nation's intelligence staff and their Iraqi counterparts. 
   In Fallujah, we spoke with Gen. Walter E. Gaskin, Marine commander in Anbar province, and other commanders of the Marine Expeditionary Force. I met three brave Rhode Islanders there: 
   Kristie St. Jean from Woonsocket, Christopher Tilson from Providence and Anthony Paulo from Westerly, who are serving our nation with dedication, courage, and honor. 
   On our return, we traveled through Germany to visit Landstuhl Regional Medical Center at Ramstein Air Base, where our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen badly injured in Iraq and Afghanistan are med-evac'd to receive critical medical care before their return home. Major Andrew Risio, who hails from Ashaway, Rhode Island, is helping provide care to our wounded soldiers in that facility. 
   Mr. President, the young men and women I met with in Iraq, and their families, have made tremendous sacrifices, and their expert performance and can-do attitude reinforce my pride in the American spirit. The security posture we maintain around our military bases is strong, and our troops are working hard to secure the cities and countryside of Iraq. The work of our intelligence and special operations personnel, which often runs non-stop through the night, is remarkable, and exhibits a level of professionalism in which every American can be very confident. 
   The achievements of our forces in Iraq are serious - and here is what impressed me from our trip: so is their commitment that the Iraqis must assume responsibility for the security and governance of their country. In nearly every briefing, at every level of command, the message came loud and clear that our military is highly focused on accomplishing a handover of security responsibilities so as to bring our troops home. 
   As a young soldier in a mess hall told me, the Iraqis ""won't stand up until we start to stand back."" 
   And I do believe the Iraqis need more motivation to stand up. There is key legislation the Iraqi parliament must pass that our military commanders believe is necessary if this surge is to succeed. Critical measures to facilitate provincial elections; regulation and revenue-sharing for the oil industry; reverse de-Baathification; and restrict sectarian militias have stalled. Iraq must take action to move this legislation forward and step up its security presence. That will require real commitment and urgency, and it would be putting it mildly to say I was not reassured by the signals I received from our meetings with Iraqi officials. There is a severe disconnect between the urgency of our generals about this legislation, and the absence of urgency, or energy, on the part of Iraqi officials. 
   One soldier I met put it in simple terms: ""If your parents are willing to pay for the movies so you don't have to use your own money, or if you can get your big sister to do your homework for you, who wants that to stop?"" 
   Mr. President, it does have to stop, and this Congress is taking action to make that clear. I was proud to vote with a majority of the Senate to pass binding, bipartisan legislation to require the safe redeployment of our brave troops, beginning in 120 days with the goal of having the vast majority of our troops redeployed from Iraq by the end of March. I'm also a cosponsor of the recently introduced Feingold-Reid legislation to continue to put pressure on the Bush administration to safely redeploy our troops. 
   Only the kind of pressure a decision to redeploy creates will provide the motivation needed for Iraq to take the necessary steps to assume responsibility for its own governance and security. An announcement that our troops will be leaving will encourage the Iraqis to step up and take their security seriously, discourage the insurgents, and send a message to the world community that stability in Iraq will no longer be the responsibility of America alone. 
   Last week, I had the opportunity to take that message directly to the Oval Office. 
   In a meeting with President Bush and several of our colleagues who had recently traveled to Iraq, I urged him that to announce a redeployment and a change of course was the strongest force in his hands. I also gave the President letters sent to me from Rhode Islanders with family members serving in Iraq. Those messages said loudly and clearly that it is time to bring our troops home. 
   But rather than acting to change course, the President keeps playing political games. He has threatened to veto legislation this Congress passed to provide critically-needed funding for our troops in the field. In our meeting last week, he said he was looking forward to a ""classic political showdown."" 
   The question of what to do in Iraq is not a political fight between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress. It's a struggle between the President and the will of the American people. It's long past time their voices were heard.

WHITEHOUSE: SURVEILLANCE BILL MUST PROTECT AMERICANS' CIVIL LIBERTIES
  As Congress debates pivotal legislation updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) urged the Senate to include strong protections for Americans' civil liberties. 
  Whitehouse, a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, is fighting to strengthen the bill's safeguards against executive overreaching. Concerned by significant flaws in the Protect America Act (S. 1927), Whitehouse has pushed to ensure the FISA court has an oversight role in cases where the administration eavesdrops on Americans traveling overseas, or when innocent Americans' conversations are intercepted incidentally.
  ""I urge my colleagues to remember that the issue we are grappling with is a simple one: on what terms will we allow this administration to spy on Americans?"" Whitehouse said today. ""Unless we really believe that when Americans leave our country, we leave our civil liberties behind; unless we really believe that this government should have unfettered power to eavesdrop on conversations of families vacationing in Europe or soldiers serving in Iraq; then the authority to spy on Americans abroad cannot be left under the exclusive control of this administration."" 
  In a Senate floor speech earlier this month, Whitehouse sharply criticized several legal theories propounded by the Office of Legal Counsel, within the Department of Justice, in secret legal memos related to surveillance. The theories suggested, among other things, that the Bush administration did not have to issue a new executive order if it chose to depart from the terms of a previous executive order.
  Because the only current restriction on wiretapping of Americans abroad is contained in an executive order, Whitehouse stressed the need for a new FISA law that included stronger protections for Americans overseas.
  The text of Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, is below.
  Floor Statement of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, as prepared for delivery
  On Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
  December 17, 2007
  Just recently, the Attorney General of the United States published an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times on our ongoing work to improve the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This follows closely on a similar opinion piece by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell in the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent that each of these be entered into the Record.
  Both go on at some length about the importance of new legislation on foreign surveillance activities. They devote paragraph after paragraph to this. But the two leaders of America's law enforcement and intelligence communities completely ignore - never once mention - the issue that is actually in dispute here: on what terms will we allow this administration to spy on Americans?
  The heart of our debate today is the question of spying on Americans, 1. when they are outside the country, or 2. when they are incidentally intercepted by surveillance targeted at someone else. 
  This - wiretapping of Americans - has been the entire subject of our work on surveillance - and Judge Mukasey and Admiral McConnell never once even mention the topic.
  There are really only two possibilities here, and each is regrettable. One is that these two gentlemen simply don't know what is going on. That seems unlikely, because Director McConnell at least has participated in hearings on the subject, where we've discussed in detail our concerns about wiretapping Americans, and members of my staff are working through the details of the issue on a nearly daily basis with lawyers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. 
  So that leaves only one alternative: that these two gentlemen do know what is going on, and just choose to talk past the real issue; ignore its very existence. That is a shame, and I hope it is not the early propaganda phase of a Bush Administration effort to replicate the August stampede that got us into this pickle.
  Since they haven't mentioned it, here's the problem.
  The Protect America Act, passed in the August stampede, contains no statutory limitation on this administration's ability to spy on Americans traveling abroad whenever it wants, for whatever purpose. 
  The only limitation that now exists on that power is Executive Order 12333, which says that the administration will not wiretap Americans overseas unless the Attorney General determines that that person is an agent of a foreign power. 
  The problem, as I noted in a speech in this Chamber recently, is the following proposition, contained in a secret Bush Administration Office of Legal Counsel memo related to surveillance activities:
  ""An executive order cannot limit a President. There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order. Rather than violate an executive order, the President has instead modified or waived it.""
  In other words, the only thing standing between Americans traveling overseas and a government wiretap is an executive order that this President believes he is under no obligation to obey, and may secretly disregard. 
  For months, as we have worked to repair the flawed bill of August, the question of spying on Americans has been the issue of concern. 
  I and my staff, and many of my colleagues and their staffs, have been working diligently and in good faith to solve this problem. 
  What I have seen has been a thoughtful exchange by well-intentioned people who are committed to keeping America safe without trampling on the rights of Americans. We have talked not only with one another, on both sides of the aisle, but with people in this administration - including the staff attorneys at the DOJ and DNI. We have worked almost all the way toward making sure that Americans who are incidentally intercepted enjoy meaningful ""minimization"" protections. We have worked I think all the way toward making sure that a court order is required to wiretap an American who happens to be overseas. 
  For both Director of National Intelligence McConnell and Attorney General Mukasey to write op-eds as if the issue of spying on Americans abroad has no role in this debate, when it has been the key and central issue in this debate, is disappointing. How big does the elephant have to be before they acknowledge it's in the room?
  Ignoring this problem may serve the Bush/Cheney interest in unaccountable executive power. But it does not protect Americans' privacy, and it does not make America safer.
  I urge my colleagues to remember that the issue we are grappling with is a simple one: on what terms will we allow this administration to spy on Americans? It is a question with real implications for our democracy, our civil liberties, and ultimately, the security of this nation.
  Unless we really believe that when Americans leave our country, we leave our civil liberties behind; unless we really believe that this government should have unfettered power to eavesdrop on conversations of families vacationing in Europe or soldiers serving in Iraq; then the authority to spy on Americans abroad cannot be left under the exclusive control of this administration. It is a matter that must be solved in the legislation Congress passes dealing with foreign intelligence.
  That is why we have been working on this question so hard.
  This is a serious question - I wish the two gentlemen leading the key departments of government involved had recognized that it exists - and I urge my colleagues to insist on the protections we have worked so hard for, that protect Americans from surveillance, as we go forward on this legislation.
  We have come a long way. Chairman Rockefeller is owed our gratitude, and Chairman Leahy. I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished ranking members, Senators Kit Bond and Arlen Specter. 
  We are on the verge of an historic moment. Let us not let this moment slip away.
  I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE, 18 SENATORS URGE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REVIEW E-PRESCRIBING FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
  After a Senate hearing made clear that new federal regulations allowing electronic prescribing for controlled substances are badly-needed and long-overdue, 18 senators joined U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) in calling on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to review the issue and urged the Drug Enforcement Administration to issue new rules promptly. 
  ""DEA regulations permitting [electronic prescribing for controlled substances, or EPCS] have been delayed for years, inhibiting wider uptake of e-prescribing, and postponing the realization of this technology's benefits,"" the senators wrote today. ""It is our belief that both the health care and law enforcement communities would benefit greatly from a secure EPCS system, and that technological solutions are at hand.

  Studies show that widespread e-prescribing, used today in about 18 percent of doctors' practices, could save $20 billion annually, as patients would experience fewer adverse drug events (ADEs) and would be more likely to adhere to a medication regimen. The Center for Information Technology Leadership (CITL) found that a national e-prescribing system could prevent 2.1 million ADEs - 130,000 of which are life-threatening - and 190,000 hospitalizations per year.
  In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee two weeks ago, Whitehouse pressed DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph T. Rannazzisi, of the Office of Diversion Control, on DEA's timeframe to revise federal rules governing dispensation of controlled substances, such as pain medications, antidepressants and some drugs used to treat asthma in children. Current regulations require that doctors write paper prescriptions for these pharmaceuticals, with the result that that most doctors resort to writing all their prescriptions by hand rather than maintain a paper system for controlled substances and an electronic system for non-controlled substances. 
  Under questioning from Whitehouse, Rannazzisi agreed to provide the committee, within two months, with information on the timing of the rulemaking process for e-prescribing of controlled substances, including the announcement of proposed rulemaking. 
  ""You've seen intense bipartisan concern about this. This is not an issue where we're going to go away,"" Whitehouse told Rannazzisi. ""I think it's important that the different elements of the administration be willing to look beyond their own brief and consider more broadly the cost-benefit to the country of getting past this, and move with according dispatch.""
  Also signing the letter were Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Burr (R-NC), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tom Coburn (R-OK), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), John Kerry (D-MA), Herb Kohl (D-WI), Tim Johnson (D-SD), Barack Obama (D-IL), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jack Reed (D-RI), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), John Thune (R-SD), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

REED, WHITEHOUSE CALL FOR 80 PERCENT CUT TO GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTANTS BY 2050
  In an effort to slow and reverse the devastating effects of global climate change, Sens. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) joined with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and several of their colleagues in introducing The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. The bill calls for an 80% reduction - compared to 1990 levels - in global warming pollutants by 2050 and offers the most progressive and comprehensive solution to reduce greenhouse gasses across the nation. 
   ""Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time, and the United States must provide meaningful action to address this problem. Climate change affects our environment, economy, and security. We must take steps at the local, state, and national levels to slow, stop, and reverse global warming emissions. It is time for the federal government to step up in this fight, and that is what this legislation seeks to do,"" said Reed, who cosponsored a similar bill with Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT), last year.  
   ""Global warming is a serious and pressing issue that can no longer be ignored. We can already see climate change at work in warmer winters, rising sea levels, and flowers in bloom in January,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""This bill will tackle global warming at its source, reducing airborne pollutants and greenhouse gasses to slow the potentially disastrous effects of higher temperatures across the world."" 
   This legislation sets out a roadmap of targets, requirements, and incentives that EPA will use to reduce U.S. emissions and help stabilize global atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Specifically, the act sets a goal of achieving a reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that will help stabilize global concentrations below 450 parts per million--a critical level as recognized by leading climate scientists. To achieve this goal, the United States must reduce its emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and make additional reductions between 2020 and 2050. The bill includes a combination of economy wide reduction targets, mandatory measures, and incentives for the development and diffusion of cleaner technologies to achieve these goals. 
   ""Global climate change is a major concern for Rhode Island. It affects our coastal communities, drinking water, energy supply, economy, and public health,"" said Reed. ""Tourism is a very important part of Rhode Island's economy and global warming brings stronger storms that can wash away beaches, roads, and homes. Our efforts to reverse these trends will not come without cost, but we simply can not afford the price of inaction."" 
   ""From Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay to ecosystems and communities all over the world, global warming is a serious threat that demands immediate and urgent action,"" said Whitehouse. ""This measure will put the United States in a position of real global leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and I'm proud to support it."" 
   Global warming is leading to increased energy and water demands, and contributing to stronger storms throughout the area. The rising ocean temperatures also bring diseases that affect oysters, scallops and quahogs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has warned that the ocean around Rhode Island could rise as much as 12 inches in the next 50 years. 
   Reed also noted that evidence shows that in Providence, the average temperature in the summer has increased 3.3 degrees over the last century. Higher temperatures allow insects that carry disease, such as mosquitoes and ticks, to show up in new areas, cover a wider range, and have longer periods of time when they are active. Rhode Island has the second-highest incident of Lyme disease in the nation. 
   The legislation is supported by such national groups as The Earth Day Network, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Environmental & Energy Study Institute, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Environmental Trust, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and U.S. PIRG.

WHITEHOUSE SHARES STRONG SUPPORT FOR VETERANS
  As he prepares to return to Washington for the start of a new session of Congress, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with Rhode Island veterans to discuss both progress made last year and the work still to be done, particularly to support service members returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   ""We have only begun to repay America's veterans the debt we owe them,"" Whitehouse said. ""I was proud to stand with Jack Reed to support more funding for health care, for research into post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and for much-needed repairs to an overburdened claims processing system. We will keep fighting to honor the service, and sacrifice, of our veterans."" 
   At a lunch discussion at the Nelson-Mack-Narragansett VFW Post in Cranston today, Whitehouse shared news on Congress's work on veterans' issues, and heard from local veterans about their concerns in the coming year.
   A vocal supporter of veterans during his first year in the Senate, Whitehouse said in a speech on the Senate floor in March: ""When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary, and stand up and serve in harm's way, we know we can never fully repay what they and their families have given us. But we can surely pledge to them that we will give them what they need in the field, and that when their service has ended, we will care for them adequately.""
   Congress Made Significant Progress on Veterans' Priorities in 2007
   $6.6 Billion Increase for Veterans' Programs: Fiscal Year 2008 appropriations legislation (P.L. 110-161) passed by Congress and signed into law in December included a significant funding increase for veterans' initiatives - $6.6 billion more than in Fiscal Year 2007 and $3.7 more than President Bush requested. The appropriations bill funds nearly 100 percent of the Independent Budget, an annual funding proposal authored by AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Paralyzed Veterans of America.
   More Support for Veterans' Health Care: The FY08 appropriations bill fully funds veterans' medical care, VA hospitals, and medical research; and allows the VA to increase funding for combat-related injuries such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), signal wounds of the Iraq war. Whitehouse cosponsored the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act, which requires a comprehensive policy to provide for the care of service members with serious injuries or illnesses; improve the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of service members with TBI and PTSD; and address deficiencies that contributed to the crisis at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Wounded Warriors Act passed as an amendment to the FY08 Defense Department spending authorization bill (H.R. 1585).
   Investigating Administrative Separations Based on Personality Disorder Diagnosis: H.R. 1585 also included another Whitehouse-supported measure to require a report by the Secretary of Defense on all cases in which active-duty or Reserve members who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan received an administrative separation from the Armed Forces on the basis of a personality disorder (S. 1817).
   Lifting Prohibitions on Concurrent Receipt: H.R. 1585, which authorized Defense Department spending for 2008, permitted concurrent receipt as of December 31, 2004 for veterans rated 100% disabled. The bill also provided for payment of special compensation, equal to the amount of retired pay forfeited because of the prohibition against concurrent receipt, for service members medically retired for a combat-related disability. While President Bush has vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act over an issue unrelated to veterans, it is expected that the administration will work with Congress to resolve the matter in coming weeks.
   Addressing the ""Widow's Tax:"" H.R. 1585 also took steps to address the ""widow's tax,"" authorizing a monthly allowance for surviving or former spouses of deceased service members whose DOD Survivor Benefit Plan is offset as a result of their VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation.
   Preventing Suicide by Veterans: Whitehouse cosponsored legislation to strengthen veterans' suicide prevention initiatives, the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act (S.479), which was signed into law in November.
   Whitehouse acknowledged that much remained to be done to address the needs of veterans and their families, especially those returning from war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is a cosponsor of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 (S.22), legislation introduced by Senator Jim Webb (D-Va.) that would give new veterans the same educational benefits as were provided after World War II. These benefits would include tuition, room and board, and a stipend for living expenses.

WHITEHOUSE HEALTH IT MEASURE IN 2008 BUDGET BLUEPRINT
  As the nation recognizes National Health IT Week 2007, Congress today approved a fiscal 2008 budget resolution that included a measure proposed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) to support health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings. 
   ""Health information technology is a crucial piece of the health care puzzle,"" said Whitehouse. ""I am encouraged - and proud - that this budget will provide this critical support for the adoption of modern health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings."" 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, joined Stabenow during the committee's consideration of the budget in March to introduce a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide incentives for the adoption of health information technology within the medical community, and payments based on adherence to clinical protocols identified as best practices. 
   The reserve fund will allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust funding levels within Congress's overall budget to allow for increased spending on health IT and best practices, so long as that spending does not increase the deficit. The Budget Committee approved the amendment unanimously. 
   Up to 100,000 lives are lost in the United States each year due to avoidable medical errors. Electronic medical records can reduce mistakes such as adverse drug events by automating and standardizing procedures; improving the coordination of chronic care and bio-surveillance; and making hospitals and physicians' offices more efficient. 
   Currently, only 25 percent of hospitals and 20 percent of physician offices utilize electronic medical records. The RAND Corporation has estimated that widespread implementation of effective electronic medical record systems could save $81 billion or more annually. 
   Whitehouse is a cosponsor of a Senate resolution, passed Tuesday by unanimous consent, recognizing the value of information technology in health care and officially designating the week beginning May 14, 2007 as National Health Information Technology Week (S. Res. 202). The week provides a forum for public and private organizations who support health information technology to gather, share ideas, and communicate with members of Congress in an effort to raise awareness about the importance of health IT.

  Calling global warming the single greatest threat to the world's natural environment, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today announced new legislation calling for a national strategy to address the threat of climate change to America's wildlife. 
   A member of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works (EPW), Whitehouse said that global warming has already begun to have a severe and lasting impact on wildlife populations and marine ecosystems in Rhode Island and around the world. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chair of the EPW Committee, will be an original cosponsor of the bill.
   ""As the waters of Narragansett Bay grow warmer, cold-water fish species with high commercial value, like winter flounder, have been replaced by warmer-water species, like scup, whose value to our fishermen is lower,"" Whitehouse said. ""Melting sea ice in Greenland is pushing polar bears closer to inhabited villages in search of food. As we work to mitigate the causes of global warming, we must also take urgent action to address its effects on wildlife, oceans, and other natural systems on which we all depend.""
   The Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act will:
   * Set New National Strategies to Address Climate Change's Impact on Wildlife and Oceans. The bill would direct the federal government to develop coordinated national strategies to identify, monitor, and protect or restore wildlife populations and habitats that are likely to be harmed by global warming; and to protect, maintain, and restore coastal and marine ecosystems to help them better withstand ocean acidification, sea level rise, and other stresses related to climate change.
   * Create Advisory Panels to Share Scientific Research and Advice. The bill would create Advisory Boards, with members appointed by the President of the National Academy of Sciences, and a new National Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center within the U.S. Geological Survey, to conduct research and provide scientific and technical advice on strategies to help wildlife, oceans, and coastal ecosystems adapt to global warming. A special panel would also be convened to look specifically at the impacts of climate change on endangered species.
   * Provide Resources to Help States Protect Wildlife and Marine Ecosystems. The bill would provide grants and other federal resources to help states, territories, and Indian tribes study wildlife, oceans, and habitats that may be affected by global warming, and plan and implement programs to mitigate the effects of climate change on these populations.

  Senate Democratic freshmen today introduced a bill to establish an independent, bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting to investigate U.S. wartime contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commission would significantly increase transparency and accountability and generate important solutions for systematic contracting problems, potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars.
  The Commission will study and investigate the impact of the government's growing reliance on civilian contractors to perform wartime functions. It will assess the extent of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement of wartime contracts, and the extent to which those responsible have been held accountable.  
  The Commission will work in consultation with a newly-expanded Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) that will be authorized to audit defense wartime contracts for logistics support, as well as other federal agency contracts for security and intelligence functions in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. This collaborative effort will result in specific findings and recommendations to improve inter-agency wartime contracting.
  ""Hundreds of billions of dollars have been allocated for reconstruction and stabilization efforts in Iraq alone, creating a strong potential for waste, fraud and abuse. The Commission will be retroactive in terms of accountability and proactive in terms of providing recommendations on wartime contracting. It will also address the widespread use of government contractors instead of American combat troops,"" said Senator Webb. 
  ""We are outsourcing this war in ways we've never seen,"" continued Webb. ""Defrauding the government of millions of taxpayer dollars should not be considered 'the cost of doing business.' It's time for Congress to stand up on behalf of the American people and say: 'We want our money back.'""
  ""During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt said, 'I don't want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States as a result of this world disaster'. And so Missouri's own Senator Harry Truman created a committee that investigated and uncovered millions of dollars in wasteful, wartime spending,"" Senator McCaskill said. 
  ""We know that the cost plus contracts used in Iraq and Afghanistan are nearly blank checks to private defense contractors, primed for waste, fraud and abuse. We need a new investigatory body, inspired by the Truman Committee, to protect our tax dollars and bring better accountability to the way we do business while at war,"" continued McCaskill.
  The bill, filed by Senators Jim Webb (D-VA) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), is inspired by the work of the ""Truman Committee"" which conducted hundreds of hearings and investigations into government waste during WWII at an estimated savings of more than $178 billion (in today's dollars) to the American taxpayer.
  This is the first joint initiative of freshman Senators, including Webb, McCaskill, Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jon Tester (D-MT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Bob Casey (PA).
  Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and Senators Tom Carper, John Kerry, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Barack Obama and Tim Johnson also serve as co-sponsors of the original amendment, filed as no. 2206, to the National Defense Authorization Act.
  Waste, Fraud, Abuse and Mismanagement of Wartime Contracts
  In Tuesday's USA Today story entitled ""Largest Iraq Contract Rife with Errors,"" government auditors reviewing contractor KBR Inc.'s annual cost estimate for services in Iraq discovered that the company proposed $110 million in charges for housing, food, water, laundry and other services on bases that had been shut down. (http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-07-16-iraq-auditors_N.htm) 
  An audit conducted by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that the Parsons Company received $186 million over the past three years to construct 142 health-care centers in Iraq. As of May 10, only 15 centers had been completed-and only eight were open to the public
  Outsourcing the War, Lack of Accountability
  There are now more contractors (180,000) than military personnel (156, 247) in Iraq. A list of companies contracted in support of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom does not exist. Figures on how much the government is paying contractors does not exist.
  The Government Accountability Office reported that between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, the U.S. government has allocated more than $300 billion to support stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq alone. This increasing reliance on contractors exposes billions of taxpayer dollars to potential misuse and waste.
  ""As a former Pennsylvania Auditor General, I know firsthand the need to aggressively root out waste in government,"" said Senator Casey. ""But it is especially egregious for companies doing business in Iraq to profit from fraud and abuse for taxpayer dollars to be lost as our troops are in harm's way.""
  ""For too long we've heard horror stories of waste, fraud and abuse by government contractors. Montana taxpayers work too hard to subsidize this kind of greed,"" said Senator Tester. ""The wars we fight and shed blood for are not for profit. This legislation brings long overdue accountability and real change to the way American contractors do business in Iraq and Afghanistan.""
  ""This proposal is long overdue,"" said Senator Klobuchar. ""Again and again we have seen contractors wastefully spend hard-working American taxpayer dollars while this Administration sat idly by - enough is enough. When I was a county attorney, we always said, 'follow the money and you'll find the bad guys.' This Commission will follow the money and it will make sure people are held accountable for waste, fraud, and abuse.""
  ""Iraq is a target rich-environment for corruption, and monitoring the expenditure of U.S. resources requires vigilance,"" said Senator Whitehouse. ""This Commission will ensure that the billions of dollars provided for reconstruction in Iraq are accounted for - so the hard-earned money U.S. taxpayers provide will serve the purposes we intend, for the benefit of both the American and the Iraqi people.""
  ""This administration has unapologetically attempted to privatize virtually every government function they can get their hands on,"" said Senator Brown. ""The rampant private contracting in Iraq is the most egregious example to date - but it's certainly not the only one.""

  Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today called for a Justice Department investigation into allegations of illegal voter suppression tactics by Republican political operatives, including former Karl Rove aide Tim Griffin, during the 2004 elections. Griffin is now serving as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
  ""At a time when the Department's political independence and its commitment to enforcement of civil rights statutes have been called into doubt, it is vitally important that the Department thoroughly investigate these allegations of unlawful voter suppression, and the apparent failure of Department employees to forward to the appropriate authorities information they had about this practice,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
  The letter cites voter suppression incidents by the Republican Party in the 1980s. During the 2004 elections, e-mail evidence suggests that Tim Griffin, then a political operative at the Republican National Committee, knew and approved of a program to ""cage"" voters - sending a political campaign mailing to targeted voters and challenging the right to vote of those whose mail was returned undelivered - in predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Florida. Last year, Griffin was appointed interim U.S. Attorney without Senate confirmation, displacing a federal prosecutor who has testified he was told he was fired to make the job available for Griffin.
  Today, Senators Kennedy and Whitehouse demanded an investigation by two DOJ watchdog agencies to determine whether Griffin may have violated the Voting Rights Act or other federal laws, and whether Justice Department officials knew of Griffin's potentially unlawful activity when he was named U.S. Attorney. 
  Kennedy and Whitehouse are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into the unprecedented firing late last year of several U.S. Attorneys. Senator Kennedy, a longtime champion for voting rights, will chair a Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday on oversight of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Whitehouse served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island from 1994-1998. 
  ""It is very disturbing to think that Department officials may have approved the appointment of a United States Attorney knowing that he had engaged in racially targeted vote caging,"" the senators wrote. ""Moreover, it is very disturbing to think that senior officials were aware of this practice and did nothing to refer their information to relevant officials within the Department for investigation and a determination as to whether it was a violation of a consent decree or law within the Department's jurisdiction to enforce."" 
  The full text of the letter is below.
  June 18, 2007
  Alberto Gonzales
  Attorney General
  United States Department of Justice 
  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, D.C. 20530
  Dear Attorney General Gonzales:
  We write to request that the Department of Justice promptly investigate allegations that the Republican National Committee engaged in ""vote caging"" during the 2004 elections. We also ask that you investigate whether any Department officials were aware of allegations that Tim Griffin had engaged in caging when he was appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and whether appropriate action was taken. Caging is a reprehensible voter suppression tactic, and it may also violate federal law and the terms of applicable judicially enforceable consent decrees. 
  Caging is a voter suppression tactic whereby a political campaign sends mail marked ""do not forward"" to a targeted group of eligible voters. A more aggressive version involves sending mail to a targeted group of voters with instructions to sign and return an acknowledgment card. The campaign then creates a list of those whose mail was returned undelivered and challenges the right of those citizens to vote - on the ground that the voter does not live at the registered address. There are many reasons why registered mail might be ""returned to sender"" that have nothing to do with a voter's eligibility. A voter might be an active member of the armed forces and stationed far from home, or a student registered at his parents' address. Even a typographical error during entry of the voter's registration information might result in an address that appears invalid. 
  The Republican Party has a long and ignominious record of caging - much of it focused on the African American community. For example, in 1981 the RNC sent a mass mailing into predominantly African American neighborhoods in New Jersey and used the resulting 45,000 letters marked ""undeliverable"" to challenge those voters' eligibility. In 1986, the RNC used similar tactics in an effort to disenfranchise roughly 31,000 voters, most of them African American, in Louisiana. These tactics led to litigation and the RNC's eventual signing of two consent decrees, still in effect, which bar the RNC from using ""ballot security"" programs ostensibly intended to prevent voter fraud as a tactic to target minority voters. 
  In 2004, however, allegations of caging by Republican officials arose again - this time over an effort to suppress votes in Florida. Emails sent in August 2004 by Tim Griffin, then Research Director and Deputy Communications Director of the RNC, demonstrate his knowledge and approval of a spreadsheet listing caged voters in predominantly African American neighborhoods in Jacksonville, Florida. (See attached.) Two years later, Mr. Griffin was appointed, without Senate confirmation, as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Such actions appear plainly to violate the consent decrees signed by the RNC in 1981 and 1986. We ask that you investigate whether in these circumstances Mr. Griffin or others may also have violated the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act, the mail fraud statute, or any other federal statute. 
  It also appears that high-ranking officials in the Department knew of Mr. Griffin's involvement in caging. Monica Goodling recently testified to the House Judiciary Committee that she discussed concerns about Mr. Griffin's involvement in caging with Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty during a session to prepare for Mr. McNulty's Congressional testimony. It is very disturbing to think that Department officials may have approved the appointment of a United States Attorney knowing that he had engaged in racially targeted vote caging. 
  Moreover, it is very disturbing to think that senior officials were aware of this practice and did nothing to refer their information to relevant officials within the Department for investigation and a determination as to whether it was a violation of a consent decree or law within the Department's jurisdiction to enforce. 
  We, therefore, ask the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility to conduct an investigation to determine who in DOJ knew about Mr. Griffin's potentially unlawful activity before he was named interim U.S. Attorney, and whether appropriate action was taken on that knowledge, and to recommend whatever action is appropriate.
  At a time when the Department's political independence and its commitment to enforcement of civil rights statutes have been called into doubt, it is vitally important that the Department thoroughly investigate these allegations of unlawful voter suppression, and the apparent failure of Department employees to forward to the appropriate authorities information they had about this practice.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF WAR IN IRAQ
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) commented today on the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq. 
   ""Tomorrow, March 19, marks the end of the fifth year that American troops have spent fighting in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of brave men and women have endured month after month in a strange land, thousands of miles from home and family. Tens of thousands of them have returned home wounded. Nearly four thousand have given their lives. They and their families are in our prayers, today and every day.
   ""Our troops have served this nation with courage and honor, and now, it's time to start bringing them home. President Bush took our country to war on false pretenses, without a plan to win the peace. His administration's misjudgments and poor decisions have cost our nation trillions of dollars, sapped the strength of our armed forces, hurt our standing in the international community, and distracted us from the urgent tasks of dismantling al Qaeda and dealing with a resurgent Taliban. Meanwhile, they have done little to alleviate the human suffering of the Iraqi people.
   ""It's clear this President will do nothing to end this endless war. I will continue to push, as Rhode Islanders have urged me to do, for a redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and I join millions of Americans working to see that our next President will seek a new direction.""
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, visited Iraq a year ago.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today delivered the following statement at a hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee on the risks of lead poisoning for children's health. 
   Thank you, Madam Chairman, for convening this hearing. Under your leadership, this Committee has focused intently on the ways in which we influence our environment and how we can be better stewards of the world around us - from cleaning up pollution in our air and water, to reversing the devastating damage caused by global climate change.
   We do this to preserve and protect; to preserve the natural resources on which we and future generations will depend, and to protect families from changes in our natural and man-made environments that can harm our lives and health. All too often, those threats appear in places we least expect.
   In recent weeks, we've been reminded of another danger found where we least expect it: in our children's toys. Hundreds of thousands of toys and other merchandise have been recalled because they contain lead paint, a poison that poses a serious risk to children's health and well-being.
   Children exposed to lead can develop learning disabilities, hearing impairments, and behavioral problems, even at extremely low levels - and this damage cannot be reversed.
   We in Rhode Island know the dangers of lead poisoning well. For years, tens of thousands of Rhode Island children have lived in homes contaminated by lead paint, exposed to lead in paint chips or dust. More than 30,000 children have been diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels in our state. Last year alone, lead poisoning was diagnosed in an additional 500 children.
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 1.7 million children aged five and younger are affected by lead poisoning. Nationwide, more than 80 percent of older homes, constructed before 1978, contain lead paint.
   While the danger of lead poisoning is in no way restricted to Rhode Island, I'm proud that our state has been a leader in the fight to raise awareness about the dangers of lead poisoning, and take strong action to reverse it.
   When I served as Rhode Island's Attorney General, we brought a public nuisance action against the companies that manufactured lead-contaminated paint, an innovative approach that, after several years and two trials, finally resulted in a jury verdict last year that the paint companies must abate the damage they caused.
   That decision was a victory for Rhode Island's children - the first of its kind in the nation. Today, we are moving ahead on abatement plans to ensure that our state's homes are safe for our children and their families.
   I'm proud that this committee has turned its attention to the serious risk presented by lead contamination and look forward to today's hearing.

WHITEHOUSE CONGRATULATES NEWPORTER ON PRESTIGIOUS ARTS AWARD
  U.S. Senator and National Council on the Arts member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) delivered the keynote address today at a ceremony honoring Nicholas Benson of Newport, the first Rhode Islander to receive a prestigious national award for folk and traditional arts. Benson, a third-generation stone letter carver and calligrapher, was recognized this morning along with eleven other recipients of the 2007 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)'s National Heritage Fellowship.  
   ""On behalf of the people of Rhode Island, I congratulate Nick on his recognition as a 2007 National Heritage Fellow - an award made possible by the commitment and vision of Rhode Island's own Senator Claiborne Pell, who helped found the NEA,"" said Whitehouse. ""Nick's work has added immeasurably to our state and our nation's cultural heritage. His dedication to the traditional forms of stone carving will help ensure that they survive for generations to come."" 
  The National Heritage Fellowship is the highest public honor awarded for folk and traditional art. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the program, which includes a one-time award of $20,000 for the recipients. 
   Benson oversees the John Stephens Shop, founded in 1705 on Newport's Thames Street. His work, and that of his father, graces the National Gallery of Art, the Kennedy Center, the National Cathedral, the World War II Memorial, the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial, and the gravestones of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis in Washington, D.C.; the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama; the Poet's Corner in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York; and the Georgia O'Keefe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
   Whitehouse was appointed as an ex-officio member to the National Council on the Arts, the advisory body to the NEA, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in July. The NEA was created in 1965 with the enactment of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, signed into law by then-President Lyndon Johnson. The bill was originally sponsored by Senator Pell, a champion of the NEA throughout his life.

REED, WHITEHOUSE OPPOSE BUSH ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE $4.7 MILLION FOR RHODE ISLAND HOMELAND SECURITY INITIATIVES
  In an effort to prevent the Bush Administration from cutting funds for homeland security programs vital to safeguarding Rhode Island's cities and ports, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) along with several colleagues last night sent a bipartisan letter to President Bush opposing the reported budget cuts. A November 26 document released from the Office of Budget Management indicated that the budget for fiscal year 2009 would cut funding in half for critical domestic homeland security initiatives and eliminate grant programs that benefit Rhode Island's port security, transit security, and emergency management. 
  ""At a time when this Administration asks for hundreds of billions of dollars to conduct its war in Iraq, it should also provide adequate support to protect Americans here at home and reject these misguided cuts to vital homeland security programs,"" wrote the senators.
  The reported funding cuts would directly impact three critical programs the Administration recently signed into law, including the Port Security Grant Program, which funds security improvements to America's ports; the Transit Security Grant Program, which helps secure high-risk mass transit; and the Emergency Performance Management Grant Program, which allows communities across the country to develop emergency management plans to respond to a disaster. 
  Rhode Island received funding from all three grant programs in fiscal year 2007, including $1,201,570 from the Port Security Grant Program; $1,219,833 (Providence) from the Transit Security Grant Program; and $2,360,209 from the Emergency Management Performance Grants.
  ""These homeland security programs were all authorized by legislation this Administration supported and signed into law,"" the senators concluded. ""Unfortunately, real security does not come cheap and cannot be achieved with mere words of support.""

WHITEHOUSE PRAISES NEW POLICY LIMITING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) praised today's move by Attorney General Michael Mukasey to restore safeguards against political interference at the Department of Justice. Earlier this year, Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney, closely questioned former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales about Bush administration changes to a policy regarding communications between the White House and the Department of Justice that significantly expanded the number of officials who could discuss pending cases and investigations.  
  ""Today's new policy is a clear, unmistakable and welcome repudiation of the Gonzales era, and this change takes a significant step towards restoring Americans' confidence in the integrity of our justice system,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm encouraged that Attorney General Mukasey has honored his commitment to begin restoring the firewall against White House politicization at the Department.""
  In the Clinton administration, a total of only seven people at the White House and the Justice Department were permitted to initiate discussions of ongoing cases or investigations, including the President, Vice President, and Attorney General. During the tenure of Attorney General John Ashcroft, that policy changed to authorize more than 40 people at the Department and more than 400 people in the White House to initiate such conversations, opening up unrestricted channels for political interference. 
  Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney, questioned Attorney General Gonzales about the revised policy during two Judiciary Committee hearings. When pressed, Gonzales said: ""I would be concerned about inappropriate access to ongoing investigations ? if that's encouraged by this kind of memorandum, I think it's something that we ought to rethink."" 
  Whitehouse specifically expressed concern that Gonzales himself signed a 2006 memorandum further expanding the authority to discuss cases to over 900 people in the executive branch, explicitly including the chief of staff and counsel to the Vice President.
  ""What on Earth business does the Office of the Vice President have in the internal workings of the Department of Justice with respect to criminal investigations, civil investigations, ongoing matters?"" Whitehouse asked Gonzales during a July 24 Judiciary Committee hearing. ""As a general matter, I would say that that's a good question,"" the Attorney General responded. The new policy excludes the Office of the Vice President from discussions about pending cases.
  In September, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation Whitehouse introduced that would require the Department of Justice and the White House to notify Congress which officials, beyond the seven authorized by the Clinton-era rules, have engaged in such discussions (S. 1845). 
  ""I'm very grateful to Chairman Pat Leahy, and to my colleagues Senator Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein, for the leading role each of them has played in our investigation into the Bush administration's unprecedented firing of several U.S. Attorneys earlier last year, and for their support of my participation as a freshman senator. This change in policy shows that the responsible use of Congress's powers of oversight can make a significant difference in our government,"" Whitehouse said.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse sharply criticized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s decision tonight to deny long-overdue waiver requests that would Rhode Island and several other states to crack down on pollution from cars and trucks on their roadways. Under the Clean Air Act, states cannot set their own pollution control standards without a waiver from EPA.  
  ""The EPA's ruling is disgraceful,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) committee. ""The Bush administration's refusal to carry out the duties imposed on it by the Clean Air Act have polluted our air and water, further endangered the health of millions of Americans, and cost us precious time in our fight to address the looming threat of global warming. We can't afford to delay strong steps to address global climate change. We will keep fighting to pressure this administration to do the right thing and allow states like Rhode Island to take action.""
  The standards proposed by the states would cut greenhouse gas pollutants by 392 million metric tons by 2020 - a reduction equivalent to taking 74 million cars off the road for an entire year, according to a report by Environment Rhode Island.
  During an EPW Committee hearing in April, Whitehouse took EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson to task over the agency's continued failure to address the waiver requests. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency that EPA does, in fact, have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate vehicle CO2 emissions, contrary to the agency's insistence otherwise. In November, California Attorney General Jerry Brown filed suit against the EPA for its refusal to issue a decision on the waivers.

WHITEHOUSE: NEW TAX FORM SHOULD HELP SENIORS CLAIM REBATE
  A simplified tax form released today by the Internal Revenue Service will help Rhode Island seniors take advantage of rebates offered under new economic stimulus legislation, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said.  
   Under the new law, the federal government will provide rebate checks, starting at $300, to low- and middle-income Americans, including seniors living on Social Security benefits and disabled veterans or their survivors. But Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging who pushed to make sure the bill included benefits for seniors, was concerned that some older Rhode Islanders might be deterred from claiming their rebates because of the legislation's requirement that everyone seeking a rebate must file a 2007 federal tax return - even if he or she does not owe taxes, as would likely be the case for tens of thousands of Rhode Island seniors.
   Today, the IRS announced that seniors will be able to fill out a special version of Form 1040A that makes clear which information they must provide in order to receive a rebate. The agency also posted an extensive ""Frequently-Asked Questions"" page on its web site, www.irs.gov, including a section specifically aimed at seniors.
   ""No senior should miss out on this much-needed assistance due to the burdens of filing a tax return,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm glad the IRS is taking steps to make this process easier for seniors, and I'll continue to watch closely to see whether there's anything more the IRS, or we in Congress, can do to help."" 
   More than 138,000 Rhode Islanders over the age of 65 received Social Security benefits in 2006, the last year for which data is available, with Social Security benefits averaging just $12,374 per year. Nationwide, 61 percent of seniors who receive Social Security benefits did not pay income taxes in 2006, a technicality that would have left them ineligible to receive aid under an earlier proposal negotiated between President Bush and the House of Representatives. 
   Whitehouse had urged Senate leaders in a letter last month to include aid to seniors in any legislation aimed at bolstering the nation's sluggish economy, noting that many Rhode Island seniors are having difficulty making ends meet amidst the high cost of energy, housing, and prescription drugs. ""For the thousands of Rhode Island seniors struggling every day just to get by, a little breathing room can make an enormous difference,"" he said. The final stimulus bill was signed into law last week.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made the following remarks on the Senate floor today. The Senate is considering the Higher Education Access Act, which would raise the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 next year and $5,400 by 2011; cap monthly loan payments at 15% of discretionary income; and increase the income level at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell Grant from $20,000 to $30,000, a change that will simplify the financial aid process for many students. 
  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, many years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson said: 
  We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.  
  Those are important words to ponder as we consider the legislation now before the Senate. I thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for their extraordinary leadership on this issue as well as so many others, and for the opportunity I have to speak today. 
  I am here to talk about an initiative that revolutionized higher education in America, and that is the Pell Grant. Inside this desk at which I stand are the names of Senators who have occupied it before me. I can actually open this drawer, take out the stuff in the drawer, and in the drawer I can see the names of Senators who have gone before me at the bottom. Here is John O. Pastore of Rhode Island, who served with great distinction and was my last Democratic predecessor in the Senate. 
  It is hard to see because he was not a proud man and wouldn't write it in great big letters, but I can see, very carefully written, ""Pell, RI,"" Senator Pell of Rhode Island. It is a remarkable thing for me to be here in this context because Senator Claiborne Pell and his wife Nuala have long been cherished friends. Senator Pell is both a mentor to me and a constant reminder of the positive impact an individual person can have through public service. 
  I am so glad the Senator Salazar from Colorado is presiding at this particular moment because I wish to describe to everyone a remarkable event that I was privileged to witness a few years ago. I was at an event in Rhode Island with a number of Senators, including the Senator Salazar. During that event, Senator Pell came to the tent we were all under in his wheelchair. As many of our colleagues know, he habitually uses a wheelchair now. The group became very quiet as he entered out of the respect we in Rhode Island have for this great and dedicated public servant. The Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, went over to Senator Pell, took his hand and shook it and told him: I would not have been able to attend college if it had not been for the support of the Pell Grant program. Now, I am standing here before you today, a United States Senator, thanks to the vision and foresight you showed years ago, your vision that every American should be able to get a college education. 
  It was an unforgettable moment then; it gives me goosebumps to recount it now. It happened because Senator Pell understood the difference that higher education could make in the lives of America's young people - from the Ken Salazar, who now serves with such distinction in this great institution, to those who will seize the opportunities of America in the decades to come. 
  Today, the program that bears Senator Pell's name is in our hands. 
  Each spring, high school seniors in Rhode Island and across the country wait anxiously for acceptance letters from the colleges of their choice. I have been through this experience recently with my daughter and all of her classmates. But for many American families, almost as important as those letters from the admissions office are the letters from the financial aid office. I have heard from so many families in Rhode Island who look ahead to the day when their children will go off to college and seize their bright futures, but wonder how they will ever be able to afford it without some form of financial aid, either from the institution itself or from the Federal Government. 
  As the cost of higher education soars higher, up 35 percent in 5 years, students and parents face ever more difficult financial choices. Many go into debt, not only through Federal student loan programs, but increasingly to private lenders. Many shoulder enormous burdens of debt that can stay with them throughout their lives. When that high school senior receives a Pell grant, money that does not have to be paid back, the dream of college becomes more of a reality. 
  Since the Pell Grant program began, these grants have been a critical form of Federal aid that has helped literally millions of young people across this country achieve a level of education that was previously out of their reach. Unfortunately, Pell Grants now represent only 33 percent, one-third, of the total cost of a 4-year public university. Twenty years ago, a Pell grant would have paid 60 percent of that cost. 
  As higher education for Americans has become more and more important, not just to their individual opportunities but also to our national economy and competitiveness - remember the words of Lyndon Johnson so many years ago: ""We have truly entered the century of the educated man"" - we need education to compete. Through that time Pell grants have actually lost value versus the actual cost of college. But the support for low-income students through the Pell grants has slid away over the years, until it is now only 33 percent of the cost of a public university. So we must recommit ourselves to making college affordable to all students. 
  The Promise Grants created by the Higher Education Access Act will guarantee that students who qualify for the maximum Pell Grant will receive $5,100 for the 2008-2009 academic year and $5,400 by 2011. For us in Rhode Island, this will mean $10 million in additional grant funds for Rhode Island students next year and, over the next 5 years, $86 million. It will also expand family access to Pell Grants, better reflecting today's economic realities. 
  Senator Pell is part of a strong tradition of Rhode Island Senators who have committed themselves to making higher education accessible to all Americans. This tradition is proudly carried on by Senator Pell's direct successor in this Chamber, my friend, Senator Jack Reed, a champion of higher education access and affordability. I admire his work to provide more Pell Grant aid for students who need it the most - those who work and those whose family income is under $30,000. 
  We see in this Chamber and across the country every day - every year in September when a new group of students go off to college - the tremendous influence the work of Senator Pell has had on the fabric of our Nation and on the lives of the millions of young Americans who have used Pell Grants to make their dream of higher education a reality. 
  I applaud this important legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have worked hard together in a wonderful bipartisan spirit to put together legislation that will advance the strength of our country and the opportunity for our young people. This is a vital step and an important investment we must make in the future of America's young people.

WHITEHOUSE SPEAKS OUT AGAINST LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TERMINAL IN WEAVER'S COVE
  Concerned that a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Fall River, Massachusetts, could pose a significant risk to public safety and the environment in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke on the Senate floor today in support of legislation that would require state approval to build LNG facilities. 
  ""I have heard Rhode Islanders' deep concern at the enormous environmental and security risks posed by LNG tankers passing so close to their homes and communities. Yet their voices have not adequately been heard in the current process for permitting LNG terminals,"" Whitehouse said. ""I am dedicated to fighting to prevent this facility from harming Rhode Island's precious marine economy and environment - and to making sure that my state and its people have an adequate voice in the permitting process."" 
  The full text of Whitehouse's statement, as delivered, is below. Attached is a chart he used during his remarks to illustrate the security zone that would be required for an LNG tanker traversing Narragansett Bay.
  Floor Statement of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse 
   On State Approval for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminals
   June 19, 2007
  I thank Senators Bingaman and Thune for their courtesy. I am here today to express my support for an amendment sponsored by my colleague, Senator Cardin, regarding State approval for liquefied natural gas terminals. I am a cosponsor of this important bipartisan amendment with Senators Mikulski, Snowe, Dodd, Kerry, Kennedy, Boxer, Lieberman, and my senior Senator, Jack Reed of Rhode Island. 
   Our country is grappling with a serious and difficult question: how to meet our growing energy needs without depleting our national resources, threatening our environment or endangering our people. 
   I strongly support the work of Senators Boxer and Bingaman, with many of our colleagues, to take a significant step forward in our use of alternative and renewable fuels. But as we develop these new and emerging fuel sources, we must take great care to balance our need for energy with other imperatives.
   Liquefied natural gas is rapidly assuming a larger share of the overall natural gas market. Over 40 new LNG terminals are now proposed for construction, many of which are planned near heavily populated areas or environmentally sensitive coastal areas. Unfortunately, in their haste to expand this market, the LNG industry and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have dismissed the risks this poses to public safety and the environment. I am particularly concerned about a proposed LNG terminal in Fall River, MA, a town of nearly 100,000 people, barely over the State line from Rhode Island. 
   This is Rhode Island's treasured Narragansett Bay. The Bay is used, particularly on beautiful summer days such as today, for commercial and recreational boating and fishing. Tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders live along its shores, and our Bay is in many ways the economic heart, as well as the environmental and recreational heart, of our Ocean State. 
   Now, to reach the LNG facility proposed for Fall River, LNG tankers would have to navigate 21 nautical miles through Narragansett Bay, passing directly by the homes and businesses of 64,000 Rhode Island residents. Along the way, tankers would pass under four heavily trafficked bridges and execute what the Coast Guard itself recently described as extremely challenging navigational maneuvers, as many as 130 times per year. 
   Moreover, the tanker requires a security zone around it as it proceeds through the Bay. Here is the tanker. This is the size of the security zone it requires, completely occupying the east passage going up through Narragansett Bay between Newport and Jamestown. It would displace all recreational boaters and other cargo boats and disrupt bridge traffic as it transits.
   The residents of my State of Rhode Island have spoken loudly and in large numbers against the LNG terminal proposed for Fall River. I have heard their deep concern about the environmental and security risks posed by LNG tankers passing so close to their homes and communities. Yet their voices have not adequately been heard in the current process for permitting LNG terminals. 
   This amendment would help correct this flaw and give all States and communities the seat at the table they deserve, by requiring the concurrence of affected States for permits to build liquefied natural gas terminals. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.

The Senate's energy bill moves us in the right direction by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and creating markets for alternative energy, while combating global warming. I am pleased my green buildings bill is a part of this effort to set a bold, new energy policy for America.""

WHITEHOUSE JOINS CRANSTON FAMILY IN FIGHT TO CURE GENETIC DISEASE
  In an effort to combat the leading genetic cause of death in children under the age of two, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has cosponsored legislation to accelerate research into spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disease that affects the Calise family of Cranston and thousands of others across the country. The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Acceleration Act (S. 2042) would rapidly advance treatments for SMA, a hereditary disorder that destroys nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement and occurs in nearly one in 6,000 births nationally. 
  ""Researchers have already made great progress in studying potential treatments and cures for this deadly condition,"" said Whitehouse. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues, especially Rhode Island's Patrick Kennedy, in an effort that will bring hope to thousands of children in our country."" 
  Whitehouse met earlier this year with Michael Calise, whose daughter Corinna was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at 11 months of age. Michael and Michelle Calise organized the Rhode Island chapter of FightSMA - Corinna's Angels - in 2001. The Calises have advocated for additional funding for SMA in order to find better treatments and a cure for the genetic disease, which can affect crawling, walking, head and neck control and even swallowing. The mutated gene that causes SMA is carried by one in every 40 people; when two gene carriers have children, each child has a 1 in 4 chance of developing the potentially fatal disease.
  ""Simply put, we know what causes SMA, we know how to fix it, we just need the support and funding for extensive clinical trials to make it happen,"" Michael and Michelle Calise said. ""We realize that there are many worthy causes in this world. We are grateful that Senator Whitehouse has chosen to support SMA."" 
  According to the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, research over the past several years has advanced so remarkably that treatment - or a cure - for SMA may soon be within reach. The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Acceleration Act will direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Coordination Committee to coordinate activities within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal health programs relating to SMA. Existing SMA clinical trial sites will be upgraded and unified into a national clinical trials network. The bill also directs the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to report to Congress within six months and submit specific recommendations to improve and expand SMA drug treatment development.
  The Spinal Muscular Atrophy Treatment Acceleration Act was authored by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). Whitehouse is an original cosponsor, along with Senator John Warner (R-Va.).

  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last week approved the FY'08 Intelligence Authorization bill, which includes a provision sponsored by U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), John Warner (R-Va.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), and Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) to require the Director of National Intelligence to produce a formal intelligence assessment on the potential national security impacts of climate change. 
   Specifically, the unclassified amendment offered by the Senators requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to produce a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on the impacts to national security from global climate change within 270 days. It requires other agencies with climate change-related expertise to cooperate in writing the NIE, and authorizes the DNI to work with outside groups as needed. Unlike a similar provision in the House version of the authorization bill, this amendment incorporates suggestions from the DNI.  
   ""Climate change projections call for massive disruptions to the global economy and health, including potential humanitarian crises, massive migrations, and impacts on energy resources. The Intelligence Community should help prepare our nation's leaders for these scenarios,"" Senator Feinstein said. ""That's why Senators Hagel, Warner, Whitehouse, Snowe, Mikulski and I offered a bipartisan measure to require the preparation of a formal National Intelligence Estimate on the potential national security impacts of global warming - and this amendment is now part of the bill approved by the Committee. Let me make clear one point: this estimate will not divert resources from other critical Intelligence Community priorities, such as the gathering of intelligence on rogue nation states, terrorist groups, or potential proliferation activities.""
   ""As I have said for many years, the way forward is to responsibly address the issue of climate change with a national strategy that incorporates economic, environmental and energy priorities,"" Senator Hagel said. ""These priorities are also an integral part of U.S. national security. It is important that we assess the potential geopolitical effects of global climate change and the implications for U.S. national security. This estimate will provide information we need to continue to help make our country secure in the years to come."" 
   ""In my 28 years in the Senate, I have focused above all on issues of national security, and I see the problem of climate change as fitting in with that focus. As a number of retired flag officers, including Generals Zinni and Sullivan, reported last month, global climate change poses a destabilizing threat to US military operations, heightens global tensions, and strains long-standing international alliances. As the Senate proceeds to legislate on climate change, it is vitally important that we receive the Intelligence Community's comprehensive view on the problem,"" Senator Warner said. 
   ""Global warming threatens our environment, our communities, and our national security,"" Senator Whitehouse said. ""Guidance from our intelligence services will help Congress better prepare for the security risks and challenges of climate change, and, we hope, help galvanize Americans to begin to take steps to reverse it.""
   ""The issue of global warming is no longer a question of science - it is a question of political will,"" Senator Snowe said. ""Global warming is a comprehensive problem that demands a comprehensive solution. And part of that solution should include this report so we have a full understanding of this issue and its effect on our nation's security for years to come.""
   ""The world is facing a climate crisis. U.S. action on global warming is long overdue,"" said Senator Mikulski. ""We need a better understanding of how climate change will impact the global economy, international health and political stability. That's why I joined my colleagues to call for this NIE - to give policymakers the information we need to make the decisions we must to protect the American people.""
   The amendment also stipulates that the Intelligence Community's assessment should be based on the conclusions of the latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC report is the consensus of more than 600 leading scientists representing 42 countries from around the world. 
   The Panel's most recent report concluded with very high confidence (90 percent certainty) that human activity has 'very likely' caused the earth's temperature to rise more than 1 degree over the last century alone. And the scientists predict that the rate of this warming will only continue to increase. If we do not take action now, the earth's temperature could rise between 3.2 to 7.8 degrees - or even higher - by the end of the century. Sea levels could rise 7 to 23 inches. Arctic sea ice would disappear entirely. And extreme weather patterns could become the norm.

WHITEHOUSE DECRIES BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S BROKEN PROMISE TO VETERANS
  Following a series of meetings with Rhode Island veterans, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) spoke on the Senate floor this morning to call on the Bush administration to support our troops through improved access to health care and other benefits for veterans, especially those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   ""When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary, and stand up and serve in harm's way, we know we can never fully repay what they and their families have given us,"" Whitehouse said. ""But we can surely pledge to them that we will give them what they need in the field, and that when their service has ended, we will care for them adequately. Breaking that promise is a dishonor to them and their sacrifice, and it is not supporting our troops."" 
   Whitehouse cited recent reports in the Washington Post and Newsweek magazine of mold-infested facilities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and frustrating bureaucratic hurdles that leave many veterans and their families without the care they need to heal and rebuild their lives.  
   The full text of Whitehouse's remarks, as prepared for delivery, is below. 
   Remarks of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Supporting Our Veterans March 1, 2007 
   Mr. President, I rise this morning because in recent days, we have learned to our great dismay that this administration has let one of our most sacred promises go unfulfilled. 
   In Rhode Island last week, I visited veterans convalescing at our VA hospital in Providence. On Tuesday, I talked with members of Rhode Island's branch of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), who came to Washington to appeal for those returning from the war in Iraq. 
   And then of course are the many brave veterans I met throughout my state over the past several years - at American Legion posts, at senior centers, at Fourth of July and Memorial Day parades, and at our many community dinners in towns all over Rhode Island. They were men and women, young and old. They had served in our nation's wars from World War II to Vietnam to the conflict in Iraq. And like the DAV members I met yesterday, they wanted us to hear what they had to tell us: the infuriating truth that we are failing to support our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary, and stand up and serve in harm's way, we know we can never fully repay what they and their families have given us. But we can surely pledge to them that we will give them what they need in the field, and that when their service has ended, we will care for them adequately. Breaking that promise is a dishonor to them and their sacrifice, and it is not supporting our troops. 
   I believe - as do many of my colleagues - that the best way to support our troops would be to deploy them out of Iraq, and define a more sensible and responsible strategy against terror. Some on the other side of the aisle have claimed our calls for a new strategy in Iraq mean we do not support our troops. This argument is truly horrible, thoroughly false, and shows the depths to which this debate has plummeted. 
   Mr. President, let's judge support for our troops within this chamber and in the Administration by real actions, not inflammatory and phony rhetoric. By that measure, it's fair to question whether the Bush administration and those in this Chamber who support the President's Iraq policy truly understand the needs of America's veterans, the men and women fighting in Iraq, and those who will soon join them as this President escalates the conflict. 
   We want our troops now in Iraq to come home safely. They want to send tens of thousands more there. They have sent them without adequate support personnel, equipment, or armor; and without adequate assurance that, should they be injured in the line of duty, they will be properly cared for when they return. 
   That is not supporting the troops. 
   In America we have the best doctors, nurses, facilities, and medical equipment. From combat medics to VA hospitals, the military can provide our active duty military personnel and veterans with medical care that's second to none. But despite all this, our military and veterans' health care system has a crushing, all-encompassing problem, and that is access to care. 
   When servicemen and women enter the VA system, in too many cases, they begin a long, uphill battle for access to the care and benefits they need to get well and rebuild their lives. The war in Iraq triggered a flood of new veterans that risks overwhelming the VA's system - 700,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are expected to enter the military and VA health care systems in the coming years, at a projected cost of as much as $600 billion. 
   According to the Army Times, the number of service members being approved for permanent disability retirement has ""plunged"" by more than two-thirds since 2001. The Army's physical disability caseload has increased by 80 percent since 2001. As it attempts to process new benefits claims in fiscal year 2006, the VA is experiencing a 400,000 case backlog. Veterans frequently wait six months to two years before they begin to receive monthly benefits. 
   These problems are especially acute in the area of mental health. More than 73,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan treated by the VA since 2002 have been diagnosed with a potential mental disorder; more than 39,000 have been tentatively diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 35 percent of Iraq veterans have sought psychological counseling within one year of returning home. But where the VA spent over $3,500 per veteran on mental health care in 1995, it spends just over $2,500 today - a drop of close to $1,000 per veteran. 
   These are troubling statistics. But they fail utterly to capture our dismay at the reports, published over the past several days in the Washington Post and Newsweek, of unacceptable living conditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Medical Center and stifling bureaucracy that blockades many veterans' access to care. 
   The Washington Post wrote of soldiers living in Walter Reed facilities infested with mold and mice, unable to get new uniforms to replace those cut from their bodies by military doctors in the field, forced to bring photos and even their own Purple Hearts to prove to file clerks that they served in Iraq. Waiting months as the VA processes benefit claims in what Marine Sgt. Ryan Groves called ""a nonstop process of stalling,"" these soldiers and their families move from appointment to appointment and submit form after form - often to replace earlier forms already lost by the system. Many suffer from brain injuries, PTSD, or other mental health conditions, but Walter Reed's outpatient facilities lack sufficient mental health counselors and social workers to help them navigate the system. 
   The Post tells us many Walter Reed outpatients now face ""teams of Army doctors scrutinizing their injuries for signs of preexisting conditions, lessening their chance for disability benefits."" Veterans often must navigate the convoluted system alone, carrying stacks of medical records from appointment to appointment. The Post quoted Vera Heron, who lived on the post for over a year helping care for her son. ""You are talking about guys and girls whose lives are disrupted for the rest of their lives, and they don't put any priority on it."" 
   Mr. President, the care of our veterans returning home from Iraq should be among our nation's highest priorities. For these soldiers and their families to feel as forgotten and abandoned as they do means, simply, that this administration is not serving them as it should - it is not serving them as they served us. It's not supporting our troops. The Air Force Times just reported that soldiers at Walter Reed have now been told not to speak to the media, and that the Pentagon has: 
   ""clamped down on media coverage of any and all Defense Department medical facilities ... saying in an email to spokespeople: 'It will be in most cases not appropriate to engage the media while this review takes place,' referring to an investigation of the problems at Walter Reed."" 
   The administration cannot, and must not, just bury its failure to support our troops. I commend our Armed Services Committee, including my senior Senator Jack Reed, for that committee's announced hearing on conditions at Walter Reed. I hope they will be relentless in their investigation. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues and the constituents we represent wholeheartedly support our troops and our veterans. Anything else you hear is a lie. We believe it's time for our soldiers to redeploy out of Iraq, because we believe that is our nation's best strategy forward in the Middle East and to combat terror. But we also believe that as they serve and when they get home, we must make good on our promises to train and equip them in their service, and to care for them in their injury and illness. It is our obligation to do this. In the face of all we have heard and seen, that obligation, like so many others, has been failed by this administration.

WHITEHOUSE JOINS NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has been appointed to serve as an ex-officio member of the National Council on the Arts, the advisory body to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). He was named to the Council by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). 
   ""I'm honored to represent the Ocean State on this distinguished panel,"" Whitehouse said. ""The NEA supports Rhode Island artists, performances, and educational opportunities that make our communities richer, our economy stronger, and our lives more meaningful. Our great senator, Claiborne Pell, championed the NEA, and I'm proud to have the opportunity to assist this organization in its important work.""
   The National Council on the Arts serves in an advisory role to the Chairman of the NEA, Dan Gioia, reviewing and making recommendations on grant applications and initiatives. Along with the six ex officio Congressional members, the council consists of 14 people widely recognized for their contribution to the arts. Over the years, members have included Duke Ellington, Leonard Bernstein, Helen Hayes, and John Steinbeck.
   The NEA was created in 1965 with the enactment of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, signed into law by then-President Lyndon Johnson. The bill was originally sponsored by former Senator Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), a champion of the NEA throughout his life. The agency has repeatedly recognized Rhode Island's contribution to the arts through grants to some of the state's famous artistic institutions, including the Trinity Repertory Company, the Everett Dance Theater, and the Rhode Island School of Design. 
   Rhode Islanders are also taking advantage of the NEA's innovative programs, such as the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence's participation in The Big Read program, which will give residents of the city of Warwick the opportunity to read Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God together.

REED, WHITEHOUSE INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO HELP RHODE ISLAND FEDERAL WORKERS
  In an effort to ensure that Rhode Island's federal employees receive equal pay for equal work, Sens. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) on Tuesday, March 20, introduced legislation to include Rhode Island in the Boston federal wage area.  
   The Rhode Island Federal Worker Fairness Act of 2007 would merge the Narragansett Bay wage area with the Boston, Massachusetts wage area to provide Rhode Island federal wage workers with pay equity in the region. 
   ""Each year, Rhode Island loses qualified federal workers to Boston and Connecticut due to significant wage disparities,"" stated Reed. ""This raises serious concerns about the fairness and equity of the federal wage pay scales. Federal wage workers perform many important duties and it is essential that they are fairly compensated for their work. I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Whitehouse to ensure that Rhode Island's federal workers receive equal pay for equal work."" 
   ""We're proud of our federal workers and their service to our nation,"" Whitehouse said. ""Bringing their pay in line with others in New England - a 12 percent raise - will help these people and their families continue living and working in Rhode Island."" 
   Rhode Island's federal agencies, currently included in the Narragansett Bay Federal Wage Area, have consistently faced problems with employee recruitment and retention due to proximity to states where wage rates are higher. The average wage grade worker in Rhode Island earns $2 per hour less than the same worker in Boston and $1.50 less than their counterpart in Hartford. 
   Federal wage rates are determined by the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC) which studies the prevailing rate system and reviews wage survey area boundaries based upon commuting patterns and census data. 
   Nearly 80 percent of all Federal Wage System workers in the United States work either in the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Naval Station Newport employs most of the nearly 500 federal wage workers in the Narragansett Bay Wage Area. These workers, including janitors, mechanics, machine tool operators, munitions and explosives operators, electricians, and engineers, are paid under one of the lowest Federal Wage System (FWS) regional pay scales in the nation while residing in one of the highest cost-of-living areas.

  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island from 1994-1998, voted on Tuesday, March 20, in support of legislation to close the loophole used by the Bush administration as part of its efforts to fire several U.S. Attorneys last year, a move widely criticized as having been motivated by partisan politics rather than genuine concerns over the job performance of the prosecutors involved.  
   ""My experience firmly convinces me that the administration of justice in this country is well-served by a healthy tension between the practical experience of the U.S. Attorneys in the field and the policy direction of the Department of Justice in Washington,"" Whitehouse said. ""When you have a Department of Justice that evaluates U.S. Attorneys on their loyalty to the President and the Attorney General, that is a very serious issue. I join the rest of my colleagues in seeking to get to the bottom of this and restore the independence and integrity of the U.S. Attorney corps and the Department of Justice."" 
   The Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 (S. 214), which would undo the Bush administration's efforts to allow the Attorney General to make interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, bypassing the Senate confirmation process, passed the Senate today by a vote of 94-2. Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is a cosponsor of the bill and took part in a press conference today with other members of the Judiciary Committee and concerned Senators to discuss next steps forward. 
   S. 214 would require that an interim appointment of a U.S. Attorney made by the Attorney General would expire after 120 days or when a successor is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, whichever comes first. If, after 120 days, no successor has been confirmed, the local district court would have the authority to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney until the vacancy is filled.

WHITEHOUSE BILL, A STEP TO REPAIR POLITICIZATION AT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES SENATE COMMITTEE
  In a bipartisan, 14-2 vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee today approved legislation authored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) aimed at restoring a critical safeguard against political interference at the Department of Justice, a step Whitehouse said would help ""restore Americans' confidence"" in the Department in the wake of the controversial tenure of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
  The bill, S. 1845, deals with the rules governing communications between the White House and the Department of Justice. During the Clinton administration, a total of only seven people at the White House and the Justice Department were permitted to initiate discussions of ongoing cases or investigations, including the President, Vice President, and Attorney General. Bush administration officials changed that policy, authorizing more than 40 people at the Department and more than 400 people - in a later revision, over 900 - in the White House to initiate such conversations. 
  Whitehouse's legislation would require the Department of Justice and the White House to notify Congress which officials, beyond the original seven, have engaged in such discussions. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Senator John Cornyn (R-Tex.) have cosponsored the bill.
  ""Political operatives in the White House have no business engaging in sensitive case-specific conversations with Justice Department lawyers. But the Bush administration's current policy allows just that,"" Whitehouse said. ""Even Attorney General Gonzales admitted that the greatest threat to the Department's independence came from the White House, so this portal between the White House and the Department bears careful scrutiny. This bill will help restore Americans' confidence in the administration of justice in this country, while ensuring this and future administrations have the flexibility to address exigencies.""
  Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney, questioned Attorney General Gonzales about the revised policy during two Judiciary Committee hearings. Gonzales himself signed a 2006 memorandum further expanding the authority to discuss cases to over 900 people in the executive branch, explicitly including officials within the Office of the Vice President.
  ""What on Earth business does the Office of the Vice President have in the internal workings of the Department of Justice with respect to criminal investigations, civil investigations, ongoing matters?"" Whitehouse asked Gonzales during a July 24 Judiciary Committee hearing. ""As a general matter, I would say that that's a good question,"" the Attorney General responded.
  Gonzales told Whitehouse that ""I would be concerned about inappropriate access to ongoing investigations ? if that's encouraged by this kind of memorandum, I think it's something that we ought to rethink.""

Reed has been working since 2004 to help secure funds for this project and wrote a letter of support to the VA. ""Our veterans have served with great distinction and it is imperative that we honor their sacrifices. This grant will help enhance the final resting place for those who served."" 
  ""The Memorial Cemetery in Exeter is among the most sacred spaces in our state, a place where families, friends, and all of us can gather to remember those who gave so much to our nation in times of war,"" Whitehouse said.

   ""On one hand, President Bush says American troop levels in Iraq need to escalate by tens of thousands, but on the other, he says things are going so well that British troops can safely leave. The President simply cannot have it both ways,"" Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted that according to an unclassified summary of January's National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) assessing the security situation in Iraq, ""Iraqi society's growing polarization, the persistent weakness of the security forces and the state in general, and all sides' ready recourse to violence are collectively driving an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political extremism."" 
   ""Rhode Islanders are rightfully growing frustrated at this administration's inability - or unwillingness - to be thoughtful and straightforward about its plans for Iraq,"" Whitehouse said. ""With a united voice, we have demanded a new direction, and we have yet to see it.""

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOW HEALTH CARE REFORM CAN LOWER COSTS
  I want first to thank Chairman Conrad for holding this hearing, and for his longstanding interest in the ways in which health care reform can significantly improve America's fiscal outlook for decades to come.
  Our health care system is broken: it yields unsatisfactory results at vast expense. The annual cost of the system exceeds $2 trillion and is expected soon to double. We spend more of our GDP on health care than any other industrialized country. Health care is one of the largest expenses for many of our companies: Starbucks spends more on health care than it does on coffee beans and Ford spends more on it than it does on steel. 
  Yet the number of uninsured Americans is climbing and will soon break 50 million. As many as 100,000 Americans are killed every year by unnecessary and avoidable medical errors. Life expectancy, obesity rates, and infant mortality rates are much worse than they should be, by most international measures. The system itself doesn't work - hospitals are broke, doctors are furious, and paperwork chokes the system. More American families are bankrupted by health care costs than any other cause. 
  I have heard from countless Rhode Islanders who have struggled to pay for their health care, and who live in fear of losing the coverage on which they and their families depend. It does not have to be this way. 
  What we are dealing with, in a nutshell, is market failure: the American health care system does not optimize quality or invest in prevention, particularly where improved care would lower cost; the system does not have the information technology infrastructure to support the improvements we need; and the way we pay for health care sends adverse price signals that steer away from the public interest. 
  Specifically in the area of health information technology, some pretty respectable organizations have looked to see what we would save in health care costs if our health IT infrastructure were adequate. Here's what they report for anticipated savings: 
  * RAND, $81 billion, conservatively;
   * David Brailer, former National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, $100 billion; and
   * The Center for Information Technology Leadership, $77 billion. 
   The average of the three estimates: $86 billion per year. 
  That is a lot of savings to leave sitting out there - savings desperately needed by American businesses and American families. 
  But rather than a focused national effort to capture the savings from health care reform, the system leaves it up to individual doctors and health care providers to choose and implement health IT infrastructure office by office. If you were in business school and you submitted that structure as a business plan for health care reform, you'd not only get an F, you might be asked to reconsider your career path.
  We have work to do in three areas: improving health care quality and prevention in ways that lower costs; fixing our information technology to increase efficiency and generate savings; and repairing the reimbursement system so it does not discourage those reforms, but rather encourages and rewards them. 
  A few weeks ago, I introduced three bills to address these problems. The Quality Reform Expansion and Savings Act of 2007 (S. 1451) would provide grants to local quality reform organizations that are engaged in the real ""R&D"" work on improving care and lowering cost in health care. 
  The National Health Information Technology and Privacy Advancement Act of 2007 (S. 1455) would create a national, private, non-profit corporation to plan, initiate, develop, finance, and manage our national IT infrastructure. I want to note especially that the funding mechanism for this bill allows the corporation to capitalize on the billions of dollars in projected savings for health information technology, raising revenue through user fees, bonds, and other appropriate tools without increasing the deficit. 
  Finally, the Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007 (S. 1471) would allow doctors and medical specialty groups to apply to their state departments of health with best practices, and to reward them for compliance with such protocols through increased public insurance payments and speedier private payments.
  The system that underlies all our health care financing, coverage, and access problems in this country is itself broken. It is administrative and bureaucratic machinery, and, like other machinery, when it is broken, it needs to be fixed. 
  Fixing the administration of our health care system will reduce costs, improve care, and make a badly-operating system run better. That can move us a critical step forward towards making sure every American family has access to health care they can afford.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on Wednesday, March 21, attended a hearing at which former Vice President Al Gore testified on climate change and the threat of global warming.  
   The full text of Senator Whitehouse's official statement is below. 
   Thank you, Madam Chairman, for convening this hearing, and Mr. Vice President, thank you for your testimony. I can say without reservation or fear of contradiction that two our strongest advocates for the environment sit in this room today, and it is a pleasure to be here with you both. 
   Mr. Vice President, I am proud to be part of a Senate and an Environment and Public Works Committee whose leaders take the threat of climate change as seriously as you do. Thanks in large part to your tireless work, the people of this nation already know much more about climate change than ever before, and are much more deeply engaged in finding solutions. 
   I received a letter recently from Dominic, a 12-year-old boy from South Coventry, Rhode Island. ""I have asthma,"" he wrote, ""so air quality is very important to me."" He wanted our government to do more to curb carbon emissions so that he could grow up breathing clean air. 
   I have joined several of my colleagues on this committee in cosponsoring the Boxer-Sanders legislation to sharply reduce emissions that contribute to global warming, and we intend to keep working hard to make sure the American people understand that this problem is real, is urgent, and is not going away. 
   I come from a state whose 1.1 million residents live less than a 30-minute drive from the water: the Blackstone and Woonsquatucket rivers, our treasured Narragansett Bay, or the Atlantic Ocean itself. The long-term effects of global warming, including the prospect of a dramatic increase in sea levels, could be devastating to Rhode Island and its people. 
   With the help of my state's environmental community, as well as my wife, Dr. Sandra Whitehouse, who is a marine biologist, I made a presentation to this Committee earlier this year that showed clearly what would happen to our Ocean State in the event of a significant rise in sea levels, the nightmare scenario you suggest in ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Newport's historic harbor would be swept away. So would downtown Providence, and coastal communities like Barrington. It would be catastrophic. 
   Recently I joined Chairman Boxer and members of this committee on a congressional visit to New Orleans to see the damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. None of us will ever forget what we saw - and none of us who live in the paths of hurricanes past and future will ever underestimate the threat to lives, communities, and local economies of another major storm. We know that the warming of our world's oceans puts us at greater risk for stronger, deadlier hurricanes, and that taking action today to slow the rate of climate change worldwide could help reduce that risk. 
   Mr. Vice President, you have managed to translate complex science into language every American can understand. Your words have resonated with this Committee and across our country. I thank you for your testimony today, and your willingness to appear.

WHITEHOUSE'S FIRST SENATE BILLS FOCUS ON HEALTH REFORM
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today unveiled his first legislation since taking office in January: a trio of bills grounded in his experience working with health care in Rhode Island and aimed at expanding the use of health information technology and improving the quality of care. 
   ""Over many years, Rhode Islanders have told me they're frustrated at a health care system that costs too much but leaves most people without the care they need,"" Whitehouse said. ""If we can make the system work better for everyone, we can cut costs, save lives, and improve the quality of the health care we receive - a critical step toward ensuring that all Americans have health care they can afford.""  
   America's health care system, Whitehouse said, is beset with several interrelated problems: it emphasizes treatment of illness rather than prevention; better or more efficient procedures are often not standardized nor in widespread use; the system's reliance on paper rather than electronic records slows the exchange of information and frequently contributes to avoidable medical errors; and the ways in which providers are compensated for the care they deliver make all those problems significantly worse. 
   Whitehouse's legislation takes steps to address those problems through three innovative, experience-based proposals: 
   Supporting Health Quality Reform. As Rhode Island's Attorney General, Whitehouse founded the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a collaborative effort between health care providers, insurers, and government that has spearheaded initiatives to expand the use of electronic health records and promote quality-based reforms. Today, many state and local organizations like the Quality Institute are serving as the ""R&D"" arm of our health care industry, gathering data and instituting reforms that are innovative models for improving the system nation-wide. The Quality Reform Expansion and Savings Act of 2007 will help advance these efforts, creating two-year federal grants for local organizations pursuing health quality reform in areas ranging from electronic record-keeping, to early prevention and detection of illness, to efforts to expand health care coverage. 
   Building a National Health IT System. Experts say the widespread adoption of health information technology could reduce dangerous, unnecessary medical errors; cut health care costs; and significantly improve the quality of care Americans receive. But despite the enormous savings potential of health IT, no national infrastructure now exists, and most local health care providers can't afford to build a system from scratch. The National Health Information Technology and Privacy Advancement Act of 2007 will establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health information technology system to help bring the extraordinary power of health IT to everyone involved in the health care system. 
   Linking Health Care Costs to Health Care Quality. Today, the system by which health care providers are reimbursed for treating illness rewards them for delivering more care to sicker patients, not preventative care to keep patients healthy. The Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007 will re-focus our health care reimbursement system on quality by allowing states to establish ""best practice"" guidelines for treating illnesses or conditions. Based on the advice and experience of medical experts in that field, these best practices will reflect treatments or procedures that result in healthier patients and reduced costs to the system. This bill also will provide for safeguards ensuring that health care services following recognized best practices are compensated accordingly.

The amendment to the Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1585) was offered by Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) 
   ""I share Rhode Islanders' frustration at President Bush's failure to change course in Iraq. That's why I've voted for every measure that would put pressure on the President to redeploy our troops and seek a new direction. It's time - long past time - for our troops to come home.
   ""I'm proud that Rhode Island's own Jack Reed is among the leaders of our fight. His amendment today would have set a smart, responsible strategy to safely redeploy American troops - but once again, the Republican minority in the Senate has used Senate rules to block the way.

DURBIN, WHITEHOUSE: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING TORTURE AUTHORIZATION
  In response to a request by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the Justice Department has announced it has launched an investigation of the role of top DOJ officials and staff attorneys in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by U.S. intelligence agencies. The investigation is being carried out by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), which is responsible for investigating employees of the DOJ who have been accused of misconduct with respect to their professional functions. 
   ""The United States has always repudiated waterboarding as a form of torture and prosecuted it as a war crime. Justice Department officials who ignored this history - even those at the highest levels - must be held accountable for their actions,"" said Durbin. ""A hard look at DOJ officials who approved waterboarding as a lawful interrogation technique is long overdue and I am pleased that the Office of Professional Responsibility has undertaken this investigation. Congress and the American people deserve to know how these decisions were made and who was involved.""
   ""Within the question, how America could come to use interrogation techniques of the Inquisition, is the question how the Department of Justice could have overlooked its own precedents to authorize waterboarding,"" said Whitehouse, a former U.S. Attorney and Attorney General for Rhode Island. ""This abject failure of scholarship suggests that the answer was preordained and the Department was driven by politics and obedience, not law and independence. I welcome OPR's report in our continuing effort to reclaim DOJ from the 'loyal Bushies' who have besmirched a great institution.""
  In a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Whitehouse is a member, General Michael Hayden, director of the CIA, publicly acknowledged for the first time that the U.S. government had used waterboarding during interrogations of several detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Attorney General Michael Mukasey has stated that the Department of Justice advised the intelligence agency that the use of waterboarding would be lawful. 
  In the wake of those statements, Senators Durbin and Whitehouse, who both serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the conduct of Justice Department officials who provided that advice, seemingly in contravention of a significant body of U.S. legal precedent. 
  In response, H. Marshall Jarrett, who heads OPR, wrote the senators that this issue is ""included in a pending OPR investigation into the circumstances surrounding the drafting"" of a 2002 Office of Legal Counsel memo on interrogation standards.

  ""I was especially proud to support legislation, which passed as part of the energy bill last night, that will make the federal government a leader in energy-efficient, environmentally-sound building standards.

  In the first of a planned week-long series of addresses on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today outlined critical challenges facing America's health care system and solutions he has proposed in the first legislation he has authored since taking office.  
   ""I have heard from countless Rhode Islanders who have struggled to pay for their health care, and who live in fear of losing coverage on which they and their families depend,"" Whitehouse said. ""I've met nurses frustrated and heartbroken that they must spend so much time filling out paperwork, and so little time caring for patients. And I've talked with families whose lives and health were shaken by terrifying medical errors - misplaced paperwork, mistaken diagnoses - that should have been totally avoidable."" 
   Whitehouse unveiled his first bills at a press conference yesterday at the Comprehensive Community Action Program (CCAP)'s Family Health Services center in Cranston, Rhode Island. The trio of measures are aimed at encouraging health quality reforms, building a national health IT infrastructure, and linking health care payments to health care quality. 
   In his remarks this morning, Whitehouse noted that the annual cost of the health care system exceeds $2 trillion - a spending level that may soon double - and that America spends 16 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, more than any other industrialized nation and double the average in the European Union. More than 46 million Americans lack health insurance. 
   ""Our current health care system is so complex, and costs so much, yet so often does not provide patients with the quality of care they desperately need,"" Whitehouse said. ""If we can reduce the cost of the underlying system by improving its performance, it will make the solutions easier for financing the system more sensibly and expanding access to all Americans."" 
   Today, Whitehouse plans to introduce the Quality Reform Expansion and Savings Act of 2007, creating two-year federal grants for local organizations pursuing health quality reform in areas ranging from electronic record-keeping, to early prevention and detection of illness, to efforts to expand health care coverage. 
   Later this week, he will introduce the National Health Information Technology and Privacy Advancement Act of 2007, to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health information technology system, and the Improved Medical Decision Incentive Act of 2007, allowing states to establish ""best practice"" guidelines for treating illnesses or conditions.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, said Congress should look further into repeated instances in which the Bush administration put politics before science, a subject detailed in a report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). 
   The report documented numerous cases in which work by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was edited, manipulated, or undermined by Bush administration political appointees. Whitehouse has been an outspoken critic of EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson and the Bush administration's environmental policy.
   ""When EPA's own scientists say Americans can't trust the agency to protect our environment, it is a scathing indictment of the Bush administration's repeated efforts to twist, misuse, and ignore scientific facts in favor of special interests,"" Whitehouse said today.
   ""This report documents case after case after case of political interference in scientific and regulatory decisions, when the final outcome was determined not by what would be best for the environment and the public, but by what the President or his political allies and campaign contributors wanted. Those misplaced priorities have cost this country dearly, and I plan to investigate this issue further in upcoming months as the EPW committee continues its oversight of the Bush administration's politicization of science.""
   The UCS report stated that its investigation showed ""an agency under siege from political pressures."" 60 percent of EPA scientists who responded to a UCS survey reported having personally experienced at least one incident of political interference during the past five years, with hundreds citing situations in which scientists objected to or removed themselves from a project because of pressure to change their findings; changes were made to documents that changed the meaning of scientific findings; or EPA officials misrepresented scientific findings.
   In response to the UCS survey, one scientist at an EPA regional office wrote: ""Do not trust the Environmental Protection Agency to protect your environment.""

WHITEHOUSE, DEMOCRATS PUSH ATTORNEY GENERAL MUKASEY FOR ANSWERS ON TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined every other Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee today in a letter to Attorney General Michael Mukasey, again urging him to state definitively whether the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" is illegal under U.S. law.
   ""Waterboarding is torture, and torture is illegal,"" Whitehouse said today. ""It is ineffective as a method of gathering intelligence, and the failure to condemn its use puts American troops in danger. I asked Judge Mukasey about this matter during his confirmation hearings last fall, and his answer was unsatisfactory. Now that he has had time to study this issue further, I hope he has come to the right conclusion."" 
   During an October 18, 2007 Judiciary Committee hearing on Mukasey's nomination, Whitehouse asked Mukasey: ""Do you have an opinion on whether water-boarding, which is the practice of putting somebody in a reclining position, strapping them down, putting cloth over their faces and pouring water over the cloth to simulate the feeling of drowning - is that constitutional?"" Mukasey replied: ""If it amounts to torture, it is not constitutional."" Mukasey's failure to state definitively that waterboarding is torture led Whitehouse to vote against his nomination.
   In response to a subsequent question by committee Democrats, Attorney General Mukasey wrote on October 30, 2007 that ""if confirmed I will review any coercive interrogation techniques currently used by the United States Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to assess whether such techniques comply with the law.""
   The full text of the letter, which was initiated by Senate Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), is below.
   January 23, 2008
   The Honorable Michael Mukasey
  Attorney General
  U.S. Department of Justice
  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, D.C. 20530
   Dear Attorney General Mukasey:
   On October 23, 2007, we wrote to you to ask you whether the abusive interrogation technique known as waterboarding is illegal.
   On October 30, you responded that waterboarding and other abusive techniques ""seem over the line or, on a personal basis, repugnant to me."" You said that you could not offer an opinion on the legality of waterboarding based on ""hypothetical facts and circumstances"" because you had not been briefed on the government's interrogation techniques: ""Legal opinions should treat real issues. I have not been briefed on techniques used in any classified interrogation program conducted by any government agency."" However, you committed that, ""if confirmed I will review any coercive interrogation techniques currently used by the United States Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to assess whether such techniques comply with the law.""
   You were confirmed as Attorney General on November 8, 2007. On November 9, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham sent you a letter stating, ""The scenarios you previously described as hypothetical are no longer so, and you now have the benefit of full access to classified programs and memoranda. We urge you to acquaint yourself immediately with these matters and take the opportunity to make clear that waterboarding is illegal and can never be employed.""
   It has been over two months since then, ample time for you to study this issue and reach a conclusion. On November 27, State Department Legal Advisor John Bellinger said you were giving ""high priority"" to reviewing interrogation techniques, claiming, ""I think there is a growing recognition ... about the need for greater clarity about what is permitted and what is prohibited.""
   Your failure to say whether waterboarding is legal has placed Judge Mark Filip, the nominee for Deputy Attorney General, in a difficult position. When Judge Filip was asked at his confirmation hearing whether waterboarding was unlawful, he was unwilling to answer because you were studying the issue: ""[T]he Attorney General of the United States is presently reviewing that legal question. \x85 I don't think I can, or anyone who could potentially [be] considered for his deputy, could get out in front of him on that question while it's under review.""
   We are concerned that your silence poses a more serious threat to American servicemembers. As we noted in our October 23rd letter:
   Your unwillingness to state that waterboarding is illegal may place Americans at risk of being subjected to this abusive technique. If the United States does not explicitly and publicly condemn waterboarding, it will be more difficult to argue that enemy forces cannot waterboard American prisoners.
   This concern was highlighted recently during ""The Legal Rights of Guantanamo Detainees: What Are They, Should They Be Changed, and Is an End in Sight?"" a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security on December 11. Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann, Legal Advisor to the Convening Authority for the Office of Military Commissions, refused to say whether it would be legal for the Iranian government to subject an American citizen to waterboarding. He also testified that it is possible that information obtained through waterboarding could be introduced as evidence in a military commission.
   In stark contrast to Brigadier General Hartmann's refusal to say whether it would be illegal to waterboard an American, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell recently opined that waterboarding would be torture if used against him. According to The New Yorker, DNI McConnell said, ""If I had water draining into my nose, oh God, I just can't imagine how painful! Whether it's torture by anybody else's definition, for me it would be torture.""
   Please respond to the following questions:
   1. Is the use of waterboading as an interrogation technique illegal under U.S. law, including treaty obligations?
   2. Based on your review of other coercive interrogation techniques and the legal analysis authorizing their use, what is your assessment of whether such techniques comply with the law?

WHITEHOUSE VOTES TO PASS BUDGET THAT FUNDS AMERICA'S PRIORITIES
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today joined a majority of the Senate to pass a budget that forestalls deep cuts proposed by President Bush and increases funding for critical national priorities such as health care for children and veterans. Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 passed this afternoon by a vote of 52-47.  
   ""The Senate passed a budget that puts the needs of working families first,"" Whitehouse said. ""The budget proposed by the President serves the wealthiest Americans at the expense of those who need our help the most. Today, the Senate reordered those priorities so we can begin to set our country on a better course."" 
   The Senate budget allocates a total of $50 billion over five years for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) - 25 times more than under the President's plan - and significant funding increases for education and veterans' health care. It reduces the federal deficit over time to reach a balanced budget by 2012. 
   Whitehouse is a member of the Senate Budget Committee. During the committee's consideration of the budget resolution last week, Whitehouse and Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) successfully offered a bipartisan measure creating a deficit-neutral reserve fund to support the adoption of modern health information technology and accepted best practices in clinical settings. Reserve funds allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to adjust the budget resolution when certain legislation is passed, to accommodate revenue and spending levels included in the bill.

WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON EPA'S AUTHORITIES TO CURB GLOBAL WARMING
  We're here today for two troubling reasons. We're here because global warming, as our chair recognizes so clearly, is a serious and urgent problem that we have to address in our communities, our states, and our nation. But we're also here because the decision handed down in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency reflects yet another instance of a disturbing legal trend: courts having to force EPA to do its job. 
   The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA represents a major step forward to reduce automotive greenhouse gas emissions. As you know, Administrator Johnson, the ruling made clear that EPA does, in fact, have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate vehicle CO2 emissions, contrary to the Agency's insistence otherwise. I hope this will compel your Agency not only to recognize its authority but also to act on it.  
   Furthermore, in issuing its opinion, the Court removed any remaining excuse your Agency has for failing to approve long-overdue waiver requests allowing Rhode Island and ten other states to set more stringent vehicle emissions standards than currently required under federal law. EPA's years of legal stonewalling, by delaying the implementation of these standards, have allowed millions of tons of carbon dioxide pollution into our air and made it more difficult making to reverse the effects of climate change. 
   Make no mistake, climate change is already having a distressing effect on Rhode Island's treasured coastal environment and our communities. The annual mean winter temperature in Narragansett Bay has increased significantly over the past 20 years, causing changes to the ecosystem such as a reduction in abundance of winter flounder, a species that thrived in the past. Predicted sea level rise will endanger many parts of the Rhode Island coastline. Just last week, the Ocean State was struck by a nor'easter that devastated our shoreline. Coastal erosion is not a new phenomenon for us, but if global warming continues to worsen, the damage will only increase. 
   There's also a larger problem. EPA's track record in court during the Bush Administration is that weak public health protections have been overturned time and time again - or EPA has conceded illegal action. Consider these examples: three air toxics rulemakings in the past month alone; a national smog rulemaking especially important to downwind communities in Rhode Island and the rest of New England; and another significant air pollution loophole that the Court said was sensible only in a ""Humpty Dumpty"" world. The courts have even begun rebuking EPA for defying the law - reminding EPA of the proper way to appeal cases, for example, or what political considerations it must ignore when it carries out the Clean Air Act. 
   As Rhode Island's Attorney General, I joined other A.G.s from nine other North East states in suing the Bush Administration for the pollution emitted by power plants in the Midwest. Prevailing winds blow pollution from Midwest power plants onto us in Rhode Island. The ozone pollution from the Midwest is so bad that even if we stopped all our in-state emissions entirely, we would still fail federal ozone standards due to pollution traveling from other states. We needed to go to court to demand that the Bush Administration be fair to New England and to enforce its own laws against big business interests. 
   EPA's refusal to carry out the duties already conferred upon it by Congress raises real questions about this administration's commitment to protecting the people of this country and its environment against harmful pollution. I look forward to learning more today about the steps EPA is taking to reconsider its decision and allow states like Rhode Island to move forward with efforts to curb the harmful effect of greenhouse gas emissions.

  With November's elections drawing closer, several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed concern today that the Department of Justice has failed to enforce a landmark law designed to help Americans register to vote.  
   In a letter to Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey, U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) noted that DOJ has vigorously enforced statutes that remove voters from the rolls, while refusing to enforce those that aim to expand voter registration. The senators asked Mukasey to specify how DOJ plans to step up enforcement of statutes meant to facilitate registration before the voter registration deadlines for the fall elections.
   ""Simply put, non-compliance with Section 7 is depriving low-income citizens of an important opportunity to participate in the democratic process,"" the senators wrote. 
   64 million Americans - nearly a third of eligible voters - were not registered to vote in 2006, up from 52 million ten years earlier. Section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), enacted in 1993 to reduce barriers to registration, requires states to make voting registration materials available to people applying or reapplying for Medicaid, food stamps, and other public assistance benefits. This requirement is in addition to the well-known ""Motor Voter"" provision, under which citizens must have the opportunity to register to vote when applying for or renewing a driver's license.
   But while voter registration at state public assistance agencies declined by 79 percent between 1995-96 and 2005-06, the Justice Department, whose Voting Section is responsible for enforcing states' compliance with NVRA, has brought only one lawsuit to enforce this provision of the statute in the last eight years. In contrast, the Department has been much more aggressive in enforcement actions under Section 8 of NVRA, which governs the purging of voter rolls. 
   ""Since 2000, the Department has brought at least five cases against states and municipalities under Section 8, while paying comparatively little attention to Section 7,"" the senators wrote. ""This creates the impression, whether founded or not, that the Department is more concerned with removing names from the voter rolls than adding them."" 
   The senators noted that enforcement of Section 7 has great potential to expand opportunities for low-income Americans to register to vote. Following DOJ's single Section 7 suit, against the state of Tennessee in 2002, the number of voter registration applications filed through public assistance agencies jumped from less than 50,000 in 1999-2000 to more than 170,000 in 2003-04. By the following year, nearly 20 percent of all public assistance registrations in the entire country took place in Tennessee.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS
  As Senate leaders negotiate legislation aimed at bolstering the country's weakening economy, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today urged them not to overlook older Americans, who are especially hard hit by the rising cost of living. Whitehouse is a member of the Senate committees on Aging and the Budget. 
   ""Troubles in the housing market, high home energy prices in a bitterly cold winter, and the rising cost of badly-needed prescription drugs force seniors in my state, and across America, to stretch already severely limited incomes even farther,"" Whitehouse wrote Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ""I encourage you to include in the stimulus package an alternative mechanism to channel funds to senior citizens.""
   Rising costs have already made making ends meet difficult for many Americans. This year, an estimated 17.8 million Americans are in families that will spend more than 25 percent of their pre-tax income on health care costs. The price of gasoline in Rhode Island is hovering around $3 a gallon, and as of December, a gallon of home heating oil cost an average of $3.29 in New England.
   With many Americans already grappling with sharp increases in day-to-day costs, rising foreclosure rates and turmoil in the mortgage securities markets have worsened the threat of a recession that could severely impact quality of life for low- and middle-income families. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 2005 a record 37.3 million American households spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing-related expenses, including rent or mortgage payments, utilities, property insurance, and property taxes. The Center for Responsible Lending has projected that an alarming one out of five subprime mortgages made during 1998-2006 will fail, which could result in 2.4 million foreclosures.
   Democrats in Congress are working to assemble an economic stimulus package that will provide fast relief to Americans in need. In his letter to Senators Reid and McConnell, Whitehouse suggested that ""[b]ecause the primary sources of income for most senior citizens are Social Security benefits and savings \x85 One possible mechanism for covering the elderly would be a temporary increase in Social Security benefits."" More than 190,000 Rhode Islanders received Social Security benefits in 2005, the last year for which data is available. Social Security beneficiaries represented 92.4 percent of Rhode Islanders aged 65 and older.

  A Riverside man whose struggles with the health care system demonstrate the need for improved health care quality and information technology will attend President Bush's State of the Union Address next week as the guest of U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Mike Tracy, a cancer survivor, will fly to Washington Monday afternoon and watch the President's speech from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives. 
  ""The victims of medical errors and poor health information technology aren't just statistics - they're people like Mike, and hundreds of thousands of others,"" Whitehouse said. ""If he'd had the benefit of better procedures and an integrated health information technology system, Mike's life could be very different today. I've asked President Bush to significantly increase federal funding for health IT, and I hope he will commit to that on Monday."" 
  Mike Tracy suffered from a misdiagnosed case of squamous cell carcinoma on his foot. His cancer therefore went untreated for several years, and he was told his leg would have to be amputated to prevent the cancer from spreading. After he sought a second opinion at a Boston hospital, his final diagnosis had to be delayed by several weeks in order for his complete records to be transferred from Providence. His amputation surgery was eventually successful and Mike now uses a prosthetic limb. Fortunately, he has been cancer-free since his surgery, but struggled financially for several years with health care premiums so high they exceeded his monthly mortgage payments.
  ""A mistaken diagnosis changed my life forever. Paper medical records meant I had to wait in limbo - knowing my life was in danger - while my chart was transferred from one hospital to another. Nobody should have to go through an experience like this,"" said Tracy. ""We need to fix the health care system.""
  A fully-interoperable, nationwide health information infrastructure could drastically improve patient care, by giving doctors on-the-spot information and data to support diagnoses and other decisions; preventing avoidable medical errors; connecting doctors, pharmacies, and hospitals to allow medical records to be transferred electronically; and allowing health care facilities to track inpatients' recovery progress. Conservative estimates of possible savings from a national health information technology system reach into the tens of billions of dollars. 
  Despite the potential benefits, a lack of investment has slowed progress towards a nationwide, interoperable health IT system. For fiscal year 2008, the Bush administration requested only $118 million - a fraction of the potential savings - in funding for the Office of the National Coordinator, the agency within the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) that coordinates the federal government's health information technology efforts. A sizable increase of this funding could help speed the development of a national health IT system.
  Earlier this month, Whitehouse wrote to President Bush asking that he increase federal funding for health information technology in next year's budget. The founder of the Rhode Island Quality Institute, a leader in the state's efforts to improve health care quality and health information technology utilization, Whitehouse has also introduced Senate legislation to establish a private, non-profit corporation tasked with developing a national, interoperable, secure health IT system (S. 1455).

For America to regain its faith and confidence in our federal justice system, it's time for this Attorney General to go.""

WHITEHOUSE, REED WIN SUPPORT FOR ESTUARY HABITAT RESTORATION
  Congress today passed legislation championed by U.S. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) to support the restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems in Rhode Island and across the country, the senators announced. 
   The Estuary Restoration Act (ERA) passed as part of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), a bipartisan bill that authorizes nearly $21 billion for essential flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects.
   A member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, Whitehouse worked with Chairman Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to ensure that the estuaries measure would be included in WRDA.  Once the Senate passed the original legislation, Reed and Whitehouse also wrote to Boxer in early July to stress that the House-Senate conference committee's report on the final bill should preserve the estuary restoration program.
   ""We have seen what unchecked development combined with more severe storms can do to vital coastal regions,"" said Whitehouse.  ""Restoring estuarine and coastal ecosystems is one important way we can preserve our environment and our communities.  I'm proud that Congress has made this critical investment, and pleased to have worked with my senior senator, Jack Reed, to accomplish this.""
   ""I am pleased that Congress has taken this important step to help restore the Ocean State's waterways. Narragansett Bay is one of the many estuaries that play a crucial role in protecting our environment and bolstering the economy.  It is imperative that we conserve our coastal habitats and natural treasures for future generations of Rhode Islanders, and we're fortunate to have Senator Whitehouse as a voice on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,"" said Reed.
   Estuaries like Narragansett Bay are essential to the health of coastal environments and economies, serving as natural barriers and helping insulate fragile ecosystems and coasts from flood waters.  The serious threats of climate change and potential sea level rise underscore the importance of restoring estuarine habitats, which can make coastlines more resilient to storm surges.  Estuary restoration benefits local economies, supporting recreational activities and preserving unique coastal cultures.  At least 75 percent of commercially and recreationally valuable fish species spend part of their lives in estuaries and coastal wetlands.
   The ERA authorizes $2.5 million annually in dedicated funding for restoration projects whose federal funding share is less than $1 million.  Four agencies, led by the Army Corps of Engineers, constitute the federal Estuary Restoration Interagency Council: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Resources Conservation Service.  Past projects undertaken by the Interagency Council include restoration of salt marshes, mudflats, wetlands, and other important coastal ecologies.
   ""Once again, the hard work and persistence of Senators Reed and Whitehouse will help make a difference in the health and future of Narragansett Bay and its watershed,"" said Save The Bay Executive Director Curt Spalding. ""Reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act preserves vital funding for estuary restoration. That means money for projects that can have both immediate and long-range impacts when it comes to protecting and fortifying our rivers, streams and wetlands. The people who do this work, as well as the people who benefit from it are grateful for the senators' leadership.""

REED, WHITEHOUSE SEEK TO PROTECT WETLANDS IN RHODE ISLAND, NATIONWIDE
  In an effort to protect Rhode Island's wetlands and rivers and strengthen our nation's environmental laws, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today joined with Russ Feingold (D-WI) and several Senate colleagues in introducing the Clean Water Restoration Act. This bill will help protect wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems, which play an important role in absorbing flood-waters, preventing pollution from reaching our rivers and streams, and providing crucial habitat for birds, fish, shellfish and other wildlife.  
  Last summer, in a controversial 4-1-4 split decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the landmark Clean Water Act of 1972 only protects ""navigable"" waters, not watersheds feeding navigable waters. This ruling would shrink the pool of water and wetland areas under federal protection and lead to increased litigation. It would also shift more of the cost and burden of safeguarding wetlands to state and local governments. 
  The Clean Water Restoration Act puts Congress clearly on record saying that the intent of the law is to protect all of the nation's waters, including wetlands, streams, tributaries, rivers, ponds, and lakes.
  ""Our communities depend on safe, clean water and for over three decades the Clean Water Act has safeguarded them. This legislation reaffirms and upholds the intent of the Clean Water Act: to establish and maintain the biological and physical integrity of our nation's waters,"" said Reed, a key member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior who cosponsored similar legislation in the last Congress. ""Rhode Island has always been a leader in conserving our natural resources. This bill will extend protections to ensure the health of more ecosystems across the nation.""
  ""The waters of the Ocean State are among our greatest treasures, and the Clean Water Act has defended them from polluters for more than three decades,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""This legislation will help ensure Rhode Island's precious marine environment, and waters around the country, remain healthy for generations into the future."" 
  The Clean Water Restoration Act will:
  * Make it clear that the full range of wetlands, streams, lakes, and other waters are protected by the Clean Water Act;
  * Delete the term ""navigable"" from the Clean Water Act to clarify that Congress's primary intent in 1972 is not to limit clean water protection to navigable waters, but to protect all of the nation's waters from pollution; and 
  * Affirm the Constitutional authority of Congress to regulate the nation's waters and wetlands so that our waterways will be protected by federal law.

  Amidst the release of a new report that the Bush Administration ignored intelligence community assessments of potential Al Qaeda influence in post-war Iraq, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) voted against legislation that would provide funding for the war without compelling the President to take steps to end it. 
   ""Whether I or any other member of this body supports our troops is not in question. We always have, and we always will,"" Whitehouse said. ""Neither is it in question whether the troops now on the ground will get the funding they need. They will. What is in question is whether this President will ever heed the calls of millions of Americans who believe his war has lasted long enough. I have heard from thousands of Rhode Islanders urging me to keep putting pressure on the President to bring this war to an end. I voted in that spirit, and I pledge my efforts will continue.""  
   Last week, Whitehouse cosponsored and voted for an amendment, offered by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), to require the President to redeploy virtually all American troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008. The Feingold-Reid measure would have ended funding for the war, with a few narrow exceptions, on that date. 
   Today the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which Whitehouse serves, released a report evaluating what the nation's intelligence agencies told the Bush administration in the days leading up to the war about the possibility that Al Qaeda or other extremists groups might gain a foothold in a fragile, newly-liberated Iraq. The sobering report found that the administration did not heed warnings from the intelligence community that an American military presence in Iraq could destabilize the country. 
   In a statement of ""additional views,"" Whitehouse joined committee chairman John D. Rockefeller (D-W.V.) and others to note that prior to the war, the intelligence community cautioned that ""the American invasion would bring about instability in Iraq that would be exploited by Iran and al-Qa'ida terrorists,"" a warning the senators called ""chilling and prescient."" 
   ""These pre-war cautions were marginalized if not ignored by an Administration set on going to war,"" the senators wrote. ""In doing so, the Bush Administration once again demonstrated its practice of cherry-picking intelligence reports and assessments that supported policy objectives and denigrating or dismissing those that did not."" 
   Among the important conclusions contained in the report: 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that establishing a stable democratic government in postwar Iraq would be a long, difficult and probably turbulent challenge. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that al Qa'ida probably would see an opportunity to accelerate its operational tempo and increase terrorist attacks during and after a U.S.-Iraq war. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that Iraq was a deeply divided society that likely would engage in violent conflict unless an occupying power prevented it. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that the United States' defeat and occupation of Iraq probably would result in a surge of political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that Iranian leaders would try to influence the shape of post-Saddam Iraq to preserve Iranian security and demonstrate that Iran is an important regional actor. 
   * The Intelligence Community assessed prior to the war that military action to eliminate Iraqi WMD [weapons of mass destruction] would not cause other regional states to abandon their WMD programs, or their desire to develop such programs.

  On Friday, May 25, Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to reveal what he knew about inappropriate, unethical and possibly illegal hiring practices occurring at the Justice Department under his watch.  
   Earlier this week, Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department aide and White House liaison, admitted in testimony before the before the House Judiciary Committee that she ""crossed the line"" in considering political ideology when interviewing applicants for career attorney positions, even going so far as researching political campaign contributions. 
   The Senators sent their questions to the Attorney General in a letter released today, which is reproduced below. 
   The Honorable Alberto R. Gonzalez Attorney General of the United States U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530-0001 
   Dear Attorney General Gonzales: 
   Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony from your former senior aide, Ms. Monica M. Goodling. Her testimony raised a number of serious questions concerning the inner workings of the Department of Justice. 
   Ms. Goodling admitted that the Justice Department, under your watch, ""crossed the line"" by routinely using political considerations in the hiring of career attorneys, judges and other non-political staff. 
   Indeed, she stated that she had regularly asked political questions of applicants for career positions, even going so far as researching potential employees' campaign contributions. 
   It appears that the implementation of such political litmus tests was an open secret at the Department. Former officials have testified that they heard rumors to that effect, and the Washington Post yesterday reported that concerns about Ms. Goodling's behavior were raised directly with your former Chief of Staff, D. Kyle Sampson. 
   These facts raise troubling questions about your role in this unprecedented politicization of the Justice Department, among them the following: 
   When, if ever, did you become aware that improper political considerations, such as party affiliation, were possibly being used in the hiring of career staff? 
   Who else in the Department of Justice was aware that politics were at play in the hiring of career staff? 
   Did anyone at any time bring to your attention concerns about improper political considerations being used? If so, who did so and when? What concrete steps did you take, if any, to address this issue and when? We hope that you will quickly and publicly answer these very serious questions. 
   Sincerely, 
   CHARLES E. SCHUMER DIANNE FEINSTEIN SHELDON WHITEHOUSE.

WHITEHOUSE TO NEW ORLEANS: WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU
  Vibrant coastal cities from Louisiana to Rhode Island are still at great risk from major natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina unless we strengthen the infrastructure that shields them, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today.  
   Whitehouse traveled to New Orleans with Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and a delegation of members of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee for a field hearing to study comprehensive approaches to coastal wetlands restoration, hurricane and storm damage protection, and debris waste management following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Senator Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who chairs the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery, joined the committee for its review. 
   Whitehouse also took part in a Blackhawk helicopter flyover of neighborhoods damaged by the storm and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects to upgrade flood and storm protection systems. The aerial tour began at Jackson Barracks and traveled over St. Bernard Parish, the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet (MRGO), the Lower 9th Ward, and the outfall canals at Orleans Avenue, 17th Street, and London Avenue. 
   ""We came to New Orleans with this message: we have not forgotten you,"" Whitehouse said, after noting that President Bush failed to even mention Katrina or New Orleans in this year's State of the Union Address. ""This morning, we flew over neighborhoods that were completely destroyed - and today have yet to be rebuilt. I would hate to think of neighborhoods in Rhode Island looking like what I have seen today, nearly a year and a half after a storm. We have an obligation to rebuild devastated cities and maintain facilities that protect them. And we need to get this right, so our coastal cities in Rhode Island and throughout the nation never again experience the devastation I witnessed today."" 
   The Committee hearing was held in the Louisiana Supreme Court building on Royal Street in downtown New Orleans. Witnesses included Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) John Paul Woodley; General Don Riley, Army Corps of Engineers; and Richard Green, Environmental Protection Agency Region 6; as well as Louisiana officials and environmental justice advocates. 
   In his opening statement Whitehouse noted that Rhode Island has itself experienced major hurricanes, and remains vulnerable to rising sea levels from storm surges and climate change. Last month, at EPW's first hearing, Whitehouse delivered a presentation on the potential impact of global warming on Rhode Island, including visual demonstrations of the effect a 20-foot rise in sea level could have in Providence, Newport, and Barrington.

  In an effort to help the Rhode Island state government improve service delivery to Medicaid patients and reduce bureaucracy, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will award the state of Rhode Island $725,253 to update and upgrade its information technology systems.  
   The Medicaid ""IT Infrastructure Transformation grant"" will be used to help the state improve their record-keeping and efficiency to help improve health care for thousands of low-income, elderly, and disabled Rhode Islanders. Rhode Island is one of 27 states receiving this federal funding, which was provided in the fiscal year 2005 budget. 
   ""I am pleased that Rhode Island has received this federal funding to help improve its health care technology,"" said Reed, a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. ""This money will allow the state to provide better quality care in a more efficient, effective, and less costly manner. Dealing with complicated health care forms and bureaucracy can be a real headache. This IT grant will go a long way toward ensuring that Medicaid-eligible Rhode Islanders can get the information and the care they need, when they need it."" 
   Last summer Senator Reed authored legislation to provide funding to establish a commission to assess how new technologies can improve the health care system for our nation's seniors and reduce costs. 
   ""Too many of the doctors and nurses I've met in Rhode Island feel they spend more time filling out paperwork than caring for patients,"" said Whitehouse. ""Better health information technology can mean less bureaucracy and red tape, fewer dangerous medical errors, lower costs, and higher-quality care. Our state has been a leader in the use of health information technology, and I'm delighted that this grant will help further our efforts."" 
   In May 2006, a coalition including the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) and SureScripts named Rhode Island first in the nation in the use of electronic prescriptions. The Rhode Island Quality Institute, an organization Whitehouse founded during his tenure as the state's Attorney General, is among the organizations leading the state's ongoing efforts to improve and expand its use of health information technology.

SCHUMER, FEINSTEIN, FEINGOLD, WHITEHOUSE CALL SOLICITOR GENERAL TO APPOINT COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL PERJURY BY ATTORNEY GENERAL
  Today, Senators Charles E. Schumer (D-NY), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Russell Feingold (D-WI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible wrongdoing by the Attorney General, originating with his statements regarding the removal and replacement of several United States Attorneys, in addition to his testimony before Congress regarding the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP.) In a letter to Paul D. Clement, Solicitor General and Acting Attorney General responsible for matters where Attorney General Gonzales has recused himself, the senators called for a special counsel to be appointed to examine the Attorney General's statements on the U.S. Attorney scandal, his testimony before Congress regarding the TSP, and potential charges of obstruction of justice, false statements, and perjury. 
  Earlier this week, Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in a Department of Justice Oversight hearing. During questioning by several members of the Committee, the Attorney General gave statements in conflict with his prior testimony before Congress. Previously, Gonzales had testified that there had not been any ""serious disagreement"" within the Administration regarding a domestic warrantless wiretapping program known as the TSP. That notion was sharply refuted in testimony by former Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who recounted a disagreement so intense that it almost led to his resignation, as well as that of John Ashcroft, Attorney General at the time. In his testimony this week, Gonzales contradicted himself by admitting that there had in fact been a dispute between the White House-where he was Counsel at the time-and the Justice Department over the TSP.
  Additionally, a number of the Attorney General's answers were in direct conflict with accounts from members of Congress and the Administration. Specifically, the Attorney General responded that TSP was not discussed at a March 10, 2004 briefing, despite a letter from John Negroponte, former Director of National Intelligence, indicating that the TSP was in fact the subject of that briefing. Testimony by CIA Director Michael Hayden also confirms that the TSP was discussed at the March 10 briefing. 
  ""Once again, Attorney General Gonzales has proven himself unable to answer a few simple and straightforward questions,"" Schumer said. ""He has now also given testimony that directly contradicts accounts by other Administration officials and members of Congress. The time has come for the Department of Justice to appoint an independent special counsel-someone in the mold of Patrick Fitzgerald-to clean up the mess that the Department of Justice has become under this Attorney General.""
  ""It is with great sadness that we come here today to call for an independent special prosecutor to determine whether Attorney General Gonzales may have misled Congress or perjured himself in testimony before Congress,"" Feinstein said. ""Americans look to their Attorney General to be above reproach, independent, and free from political influence. They want a straight shooter, who will enforce the law no matter what. But Alberto Gonzales has turned this office on its head.""
  ""As the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the country, the Attorney General has a special duty to be truthful and fully forthcoming with Congress,"" Feingold said. In his testimony, the Attorney General has demonstrated a clear pattern of intentionally misleading Congress about Deputy Attorney General James Comey and internal disputes within the administration. A special counsel is needed to look into the litany of misleading statements the Attorney General has made and determine whether criminal charges are warranted.""
  ""The Attorney General's testimony this week left me no choice but to believe that the Senate, and the American people, were being misled about a matter of grave importance to our national security,"" Whitehouse said. ""For the Bush administration to continue to assert that it is above the law is simply unacceptable. We're calling for a special counsel because we need an independent, impartial investigation to determine exactly what's happened here, and to ensure accountability.""
  In this particular situation, where wrongdoing may have occurred at the highest echelons of the Department's management, an outside special counsel is particularly important to ensure an independent and even-handed investigation. 
  In 2003, Senator Schumer was the first person to call for a special counsel to be appointed in the Valerie Plame leak investigation. As a direct consequence, Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed Special Prosecutor, ultimately resulting in the indictment and conviction of former Chief of Staff to the Vice President, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby.

WHITEHOUSE: VOTE TO PROTECT WORKERS' FREEDOM TO ORGANIZE
  For more than one hundred years, organized labor has been a strong voice, and a powerful advocate, for the working men and women of America in their fight for fair treatment, safe workplaces, and honest pay for an honest day's work. But in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for workers to organize and gain that voice. 
   Today, the Senate has an important opportunity to begin to reverse this trend: by voting in support of the Employee Free Choice Act, which takes several critical steps to ensure that all American workers have the right to form and join a union.
   When a majority of workers wish to organize, they should have that right. This legislation would require the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to certify a bargaining representative if a majority of the employees sign authorization cards. The bill would also direct the NLRB to issue guidelines for selecting a bargaining representative via majority sign-up - including model language for authorization cards and procedures to verify the validity of authorization cards. 
   Newly-formed unions shouldn't face stalemates and stall tactics as they advocate for their members. The Employee Free Choice Act would set a waivable timeline for reaching a first contract agreement once a representative has been certified and bargaining has commenced. Parties would be required to meet and begin bargaining no later than ten days after receiving a written request from the newly certified bargaining representative. 
   And this bill would strengthen existing penalties for unfair labor practices, making it easier for workers to organize without fear of reprisal or backlash. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act is good for American workers - and for our economy. As a group, union members make 30 percent more per week than their non-union counterparts. They are 63 percent more likely to have health insurance, and they are a staggering 386 percent more likely to have a guaranteed pension. At a time of growing income inequality, when everyday families in this country are stretched to the limit just to afford health care, or the mortgage, or gas to drive to work and to school, we can't let this opportunity slip by. The Senate must pass this bill.
   The Employee Free Choice Act would allow workers to choose a union without fear, facilitate contract negotiations, and prevent the anti-organizing scare tactics that, unfortunately, still exist today. 
   Mr. President, the Employee Free Choice Act is the first step towards realizing the dream of fairness for every American worker. I am proud to support this legislation, I ask my colleagues to do the same, and I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE CONTINUES FIGHT TO REPAIR FLAWS IN MEDICARE DRUG PROGRAM
  Over lunch with North Providence seniors today, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Committee on Aging, announced he has cosponsored a pair of bills designed to correct serious flaws in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. 
  ""I've met so many Rhode Island seniors who struggle to pay for the prescription drugs they need,"" said Whitehouse. ""Between the Bush administration's misplaced priorities and big drug companies out to protect their sky-high profits, we have an uphill battle to fight to make the Part D program work better for seniors.  
  ""Empowering Medicare to offer its own drug coverage plans and negotiate for lower drug prices are common-sense fixes that will lower seniors' costs and give them added peace of mind. I'll keep fighting to ensure all seniors have the drug coverage they need and deserve.""
  Under the Medicare Part D program, enacted in 2003, drug coverage for seniors is available only through private insurers. The enormous array of choices offered by these private plans - 51 in Rhode Island alone this year - can prove difficult for seniors to navigate. Nationwide, 73 percent of seniors think the Medicare prescription drug benefit is ""too complicated."" 60 percent agree that ""Medicare should select a handful of plans that meet certain standards, so seniors have an easier time choosing.""
  Whitehouse has cosponsored legislation that would give seniors a choice they could depend on to put their needs first - not a corporate bottom line. The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act of 2007 (S. 2219), introduced by Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create one or more Medicare-operated drug plans that could compete with existing private prescription drug plans.
  Today, a standard private Part D drug plan is required to pay 75 percent of a beneficiary's annual drug costs up to $2,400, following a $265 deductible. Once costs exceed $2,400, seniors must pay the entire cost of their prescription drugs, until their spending reaches $5,451 for the year, when coverage resumes. The gap, known as the ""doughnut hole,"" forces seniors to spend as much as $3,850 out of pocket for prescription drugs.
  Under current law, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating with drug companies for lower prescription drug prices. The Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the Veterans Administration, which does have this negotiating power, pays an average of 70 percent less for prescription drugs than Medicare does. The Center also found that the cost to taxpayers of maintaining a private Medicare drug benefit (rather than one administered directly by Medicare, as S. 2219 would provide), combined with Medicare's inability to negotiate lower prices, reaches as much as $30 billion per year.
  To solve this problem, Whitehouse cosponsored the Prescription Drug Gap Reduction Act of 2007 (S. 2089). Introduced by Senator Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), S. 2089 would direct the Secretary of HHS to negotiate for lower drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of more than 40 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries, applying the savings towards filling the doughnut hole in the current program. 
  At today's lunch meeting, held at the Salvatore Mancini Senior Resource Center, Whitehouse argued that seniors in Rhode Island and throughout the country shouldn't be asked to bear the burden of higher costs. Allowing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies would bring drug costs down and help eliminate the doughnut hole, he said.

WHITEHOUSE BILL ON VOTING RIGHTS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) testified today before the Senate Rules and Administration Committee on legislation he has introduced that would combat a voter-suppression tactic called ""vote caging."" 
   The Caging Prohibition Act (S. 2305), introduced last November, would, among other things, prohibit ""vote caging."" Caging is a voter suppression tactic in which a campaign sends mail marked ""do not forward"" or ""return to sender"" to a targeted group of voters - often minorities or residents of minority neighborhoods. A list of those whose mail was returned ""undelivered"" is then used as the basis for challenges to the right of those citizens to vote, on the grounds that the voter does not live at the address where he or she is registered. Of course, there are many reasons that mail could be returned undelivered, for example; an eligible voter could be overseas on active military service or a student lawfully registered at a parent's address.
   ""It is an unfortunate reality that, with so much at stake in the ballot box, organized efforts to suppress the vote go nearly as far back as the right to vote itself,"" said Whitehouse, a former United States Attorney, Rhode Island Attorney General, and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""Protecting the rights of eligible voters is essential to the health of our democracy.""
   There is evidence that caging lists were assembled in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania during the 2004 elections, possibly intended as the basis for massive voter eligibility challenges. The Florida incident made headlines again earlier this year during Congress's investigation into the firing of several U.S. Attorneys, when allegations resurfaced that Tim Griffin, the former RNC opposition researcher then serving as an interim U.S. Attorney in Arkansas, had been involved in an effort to cage voters in Jacksonville. Last June, Whitehouse and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called for a Justice Department investigation into allegations that Griffin and others at the RNC may have engaged in caging during the 2004 elections.
   Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the Rules Committee, is a cosponsor of the Caging Prohibition Act and scheduled the hearing to consider the bill. Other cosponsors include Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), John Kerry (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). To date, the bill has also been endorsed by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and People for the American Way.

  The Senate took a critical step toward bringing our troops home from Iraq with a vote this evening in support of a March 31, 2008 redeployment date, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today. The 50-48 vote defeated an attempt to remove language specifying the date from a bill providing $122 billion in funding for the war. Whitehouse voted in favor of keeping the redeployment date.  
   ""The American people have said it's time for a new direction, and both the House and the Senate have listened,"" Whitehouse said. ""Bringing American troops home and handing over security responsibilities to the Iraqis is now our best and only step forward, and I hope the President will not miss this opportunity to change course."" 
   The Senate is expected to vote soon on the underlying supplemental war spending bill. Once the Senate's version is reconciled with similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives, the consensus measure will go to the President's desk for signature or veto. 
   Whitehouse traveled to Iraq from March 16-19 to meet with American troops and assess the situation on the ground there. While in country, he met with American military commanders, including General David Petraeus; as well as several high-ranking Iraqi officials and members of the U.S. embassy and intelligence staffs.

WHITEHOUSE APPLAUDS SENATE APPROVAL FOR HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION
  The U.S. Senate today approved a measure cosponsored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to give local law enforcement stronger tools to prosecute hate crimes. The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2007 (S. 1105) expands the federal hate crimes statute to include sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability status. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has documented more than 114,000 hate crimes since 1991. 
   ""Crimes of hate are unacceptable and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Whitehouse, a former Rhode Island Attorney General who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""I'm proud to support this effort to protect more Americans and end these crimes of bias forever."" 
   The Matthew Shepard Act is named for the 21-year-old Wyoming man whose brutal murder in 1998 brought new national attention to crimes of hate. The bill would give local law enforcement officials important tools, like training or direct assistance, to combat crimes that show evidence of prejudice based on sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability status; and encourage Americans to report hate crimes, through increased public education and awareness. 
   The bill also would allow local prosecutors to pursue bias-motivated crime under federal law in areas in which state statutes are inadequate. Currently, only 27 states and Washington, D.C. classify gender-based crimes as hate crimes; 31 states and Washington, D.C. include sexual-orientation based crimes; and only 31 states and Washington, D.C. include disability-based crimes. Rhode Island General Law ? 12-19-38 provides for stronger penalties in cases in which victims of crimes are chosen ""hatred or animus toward [his or her] actual or perceived disability, religion, color, race, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, or gender."" 
   S. 1105 was adopted as an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill now under consideration by the Senate. Congress is expected to pass that measure in coming days.

The Senators sent a letter to Vice Premier Wu Yi on the eve of the upcoming meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) that is set to take place in Washington on April 11th.

""I'm pleased to join with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to press for real results before the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade takes place in Washington next week.""  
   The Senators specifically note that a failure by China to address key outstanding concerns creates ""the risk of serious damage,"" and ask Vice Premier Wu Yi to make meaningful commitments to: 
   achieve significant, verifiable, and sustained reductions in piracy, counterfeiting, and other infringements of intellectual property rights (""IPR""), specifically ending the production of pirated optical discs and stepping up dramatically IPR enforcement at trade fairs; increase the flexibility of the RMB and allow it to demonstrate greater responsiveness to market forces; increase transparency in government subsidies and reduce government intervention in the marketplace; lift China's WTO-inconsistent ban on U.S. beef; and join, by a date certain, the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. 
   The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdictional control over the nation's tax and trade policies. Last week, the Committee held a hearing reviewing the U.S.-China economic relationship. 
   The members of the Committee that signed the letter are: Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Craig Thomas (R-WY), Blanche Lincoln (D-AK), Rick Santorum (R-PA), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), John Kerry (D-MA), Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Trent Lott (R-MS) and Bill Frist (R-TN). 
   The US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade was established in 1983 as a forum for high-level dialogue on bilateral trade issues and a vehicle for promoting commercial relations. The JCCT works to resolve problems affecting US companies and serves as an umbrella for trade events and World Trade Organization (WTO) technical assistance programs. The JCCT is co-chaired by US Secretary of Commerce and China's Minister of Commerce.

   Beijing, P.R. China 
   Dear Madam Vice Minister: 
   As members of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees U.S. trade policy in the United States Senate, we write on the eve of the upcoming meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (""JCCT"") to urge your government to take actions that would help redress key economic imbalances between the United States and China. Over the years, you have demonstrated strong leadership to strengthen trans-Pacific economic ties, and we appreciate the commitments you have undertaken at past JCCT meetings to address important obstacles to U.S.-China trade. 
   Today, we look to your leadership to help resolve serious problems that face our trade and economic relationship - symbolized by the record $200 billion trade deficit that the United States posted last year with China, the largest deficit between any two countries in history. It was obvious at last week's Senate Finance Committee hearing that serious questions exist regarding the value of China's currency and China's compliance with its commitments in the World Trade Organization (""WTO""). Ambassador Portman also noted in his recent review of China trade policy that our relationship lacks ""equity, durability and balance."" 
   Our economic relationship is now at a critical point, and failure by China to address key outstanding trade concerns and fulfill longstanding commitments creates the risk of serious damage. As you prepare for the JCCT meeting, we encourage you to bear this risk in mind and come to Washington prepared to make meaningful commitments to: 
   achieve significant, verifiable, and sustained reductions in piracy, counterfeiting, and other infringements of intellectual property rights (""IPR""), specifically ending the production of pirated optical discs and stepping up dramatically IPR enforcement at trade fairs; increase the flexibility of the RMB and allow it to demonstrate greater responsiveness to market forces; increase transparency in government subsidies and reduce government intervention in the marketplace; lift China's WTO-inconsistent ban on U.S. beef; and join, by a date certain, the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. We look to China to take expeditious action on these issues as a way to put our countries on a path to a healthier and more stable trade, economic, and political relationship.

  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-UT), today introduced the Small Business Health Education and Awareness Act of 2006, legislation that provides matching grants between $150,000 and $300,000 to Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) nationwide in order to increase awareness regarding health insurance options for small businesses.  
   ""The explosive growth in health insurance premiums continues to suffocate small businesses throughout America,"" said Senator Snowe. ""We've now experienced double-digit percentage increases in health insurance premiums in four of the past five years. Limited competition and few choices today prevent millions of small businesses from purchasing quality, affordable health insurance. It is time for Congress to act."" 
   ""This legislation is an important step towards assisting small businesses as they strive to remain competitive with larger businesses that already have the freedom to offer affordable health insurance to their employees,"" stated Senator Snowe. 
   Senator Snowe noted that study after study has found that the smallest businesses are least likely to offer insurance and most in need of assistance. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 60.6 percent of the nearly 38 million working uninsured either work for a small business with fewer than 100 employees or are self-employed. 
   Senator Snowe's bill establishes a pilot, competitive matching-grant program for SBDCs to increase small business awareness regarding health insurance options available in their areas. Recent research conducted by the Healthcare Leadership Council has found that a short educational briefing can increase the likelihood that small businesses will offer health insurance, by approximately 33 percent. The grants under Senator Snowe's bill would be for SBDCs to develop short presentations to help encourage small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees 
   The legislation requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make up to 20 matching grants to SBDCs across the country. No more than two SBDCs (one per state) would be chosen from each of the SBA's 10 regions. The grants must be more than $150,000, but less than $300,000 and be consistent with the matching requirement under current law. In creating the materials for their grant programs, participating SBDCs will evaluate and incorporate relevant resources detailing existing health insurance options. In addition, SBDCs participating in the pilot program would be required to submit a quarterly report to the SBA. 
   SBDCs are valuable business assistance partners provide entrepreneurs with resources so they can start and grow a small business. Currently, there are over 1,100 service locations in every state and territory delivering management and technical counseling to prospective and existing small business owners.

SNOWE DISPLEASED PROVISION INCLUDED FOR OFF-SHORE WIND FARMS
  Late last night the House-Senate Coast Guard Authorization Conference Committee, of which Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is a member, approved the Coast Guard Conference Report - clearing the way for final passage of this legislation by both Congressional chambers. 
   The Conference Report authorizes $8.7 billion for Fiscal Year 2006. The authorization bill allow the Coast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions such as search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection, as well as fund the necessary missions related to ports, waterways, and coastal security.  
   ""With this Conference Report, the Congress has acted to shore up the Coast Guard at a time when it has been stretched too thin to meet its various responsibilities,"" said Snowe. ""The Coast Guard has the unenviable job of performing its traditional search and rescue and fisheries enforcement missions, while also protecting our nation's borders from terrorist infiltration - all with an aging and undersized fleet. I believe that this conference report has included essential funding that the Coast Guard has so desperately needed for too long."" 
   While Snowe, who is chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and the Coast Guard, is pleased that this legislation passed its final hurdle on its way to final passage, she believes that a special interest provision in the bill to allow the Governor of Massachusetts to have final veto authority over a wind power project in Nantucket Sound should not have been included in this legislation. 
   ""I do not believe that we should have included a provision in this conference report to allow the Governor of Massachusetts to have final veto authority over a wind power project in Nantucket Sound,"" said Snowe. ""There could well be legitimate concerns about the feasibility of off-shore wind farms. But that necessitates a full-scale review through the normal committee process, not through a closed conference committee. Despite my objections, this provision remained in the legislation."" 
   The Conference Report includes numerous measures that would allow the Coast Guard to enforce provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, an essential element in securing the nation's ports, waterways, and transportation networks. Additionally, it would address maritime safety issues by allowing the Coast Guard to continue training both the commercial fishing industry and the recreational boating public in issues regarding safety at sea. 
   As a reflection of its support of the Coast Guard recapitalizing its fleet of cutters and aircraft, the Conference Report authorizes $1.3 billion for the Coast Guard's Deepwater Program. Snowe has long fought to accelerate the Deepwater Program and is pleased that this funding has been included. 
   ""It is beyond question that the Deepwater Program is an essential component of allowing the Coast Guard to protect our borders. I am pleased that we included this funding and vow to continue the fight to ensure that the Coast Guard is able to protect our nation,"" said Snowe. 
   In response to the final report of the United States Commission on Ocean Policy, the Conference Report includes provisions that would allow the Coast Guard to work with other federal, state, and local agencies in developing plans to assist vessels in distress, thus eliminating the potential for loss of life and environmental damage. It also directs the Coast Guard to develop steps that will allow it to better detect and interdict foreign vessels that are violating fishing regulations. 
   The Conference Report also includes the following highlights: 
   Authorizes a supplemental $300 million for Coast Guard operations and maintenance associated with Katrina, as well as for the increased costs of fuel. 
   Authorizes a supplemental $200 million for capital improvements for Coast Guard facilities in Fiscal Year 2006, including air and vessel assets, and for equipment that needs to be replaced, including aids to navigation to ensure safe transits through shipping lanes. 
   Officially commends the Coast Guard for its exemplary response to Hurricane Katrina and calls for the Coast Guard to play a major role in any future national emergency or natural disaster. 
   Authorizes the Coast Guard to use its maritime safety and security teams for missions other than security missions, such as response to natural disasters like Katrina. 
   Extends the use of annual leave for Coast Guard members involved in the response effort to Hurricane Katrina. 
   Requires the Coast Guard to report to Congress on Katrina's impact on Coast Guard operations and facilities and on navigable waterways, facilities located in such waterways, and on the environment. 
   Raises the liability limits for responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act.

""Given the realities of our post September 11 world, it only makes sense for the federal government to provide grants to states to help them prepare for an emergency. I have long supported the Emergency Management Performance Grant program because it allows states the flexibility to institute a localized response structure that will keep residents safe and out of harms way if catastrophe hits.""  
   The full text of the letter follows: 
   Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Byrd: 
   We are writing to request an increase in funding for the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program in the FY07 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. We request that you fund the EMPG program at $235 million. 
   The EMPG program was created to assist in developing an effective emergency response system at the state and local government level to handle disasters and emergencies of all types and sizes. It provides the only source of federal assistance to states and localities to develop and build their emergency management capabilities. The EMPG program gives the flexibility to allocate funds according to risk, thus addressing the most urgent state and local needs. The program is a pass through grant that is matched dollar for dollar by state and local governments. 
   Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the EMPG program has been used to increase state and local preparedness around the country. In August of last year, Hurricane Katrina dramatically demonstrated the increased need for every state and local government to have strong emergency management capability in preparation for all disasters. The EMPG program supports this need. Despite this need, the EMPG program has been historically underfunded. A 2004 survey conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) concluded that the program faces a $264 million shortfall. State and local governments cannot be expected to take on the ever growing homeland security mission without adequate resources to do the job. While we recognize the current fiscal situation and pressures to reduce spending, it is critical that we provide adequate funding for this program. 
   We would like to thank you for your attention to the EMPG program and the support for an increase of $5 million in the Department of Homeland Security FY06 appropriations, for a total of $185 million. We are pleased that you have set a precedent for increased funding of the EMPG program. Unfortunately, the President's budget request represents an approximately $13 million cut to this vital program. Not only should this cut from FY06 be restored, but we request that you increase funding for the EMPG program an additional $50 million for a total of $235 million, to begin to address the shortfall identified by NEMA. 
   Additionally, we request that your subcommittee maintain the EMPG program as a separate and distinct program. 
   Thank you for your consideration of this request to fund the EMPG program at $235 million for FY2007. We look forward to working with you on this important program.

SNOWE VOICES SUPPORT FOR OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE AND SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, today expressed her support for federal offshore aquaculture legislation and its potential economic, environmental, and health benefits at a National Ocean Policy Study Subcommittee Hearing on Offshore Aquaculture. Sebastian Belle, Executive Director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, testified at the hearing. 
   ""Offshore aquaculture has the potential to provide myriad economic, environmental, and health benefits to citizens throughout our country,"" said Snowe. ""My home state of Maine is already at the forefront of exploring this new way of satisfying the demand for seafood without over harvesting our ocean resources. I believe that Congress must encourage environmentally sound forms of aquaculture for our coastal communities as well as provide an appropriate regulatory framework for the industry so that we can continue to benefit from this growing segment of the seafood industry.""  
   The following is Snowe's statement as prepared for delivery: 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for convening today's hearing on offshore aquaculture. The State of Maine has decades of experience in fish farming, especially in near-shore state waters, and we recognize that this industry could soon have new opportunities to pursue aquaculture in offshore, federal waters. Therefore, this timely hearing will help ensure that Congress understands the issues and challenges facing this emerging industry, so we can authorize an appropriate federal framework for developing and promoting offshore aquaculture. 
   Before we discuss the specific issues of the legislative proposals for regulating fish farming, we should take a step back and look at the global dimensions of seafood production and demand. The United Nations tells us that 60 percent of the world's fisheries are either depleted or fully exploited, yet global demand for seafood - a healthy source of protein - continues to grow, perhaps up to 70 percent in the coming decades. Not surprisingly, the world is looking to aquaculture to meet this ever-increasing demand. 
   While many countries, especially in Asia, have developed aggressive policies on fish farming, the United States has not kept pace. Less than 40 percent of our seafood is produced domestically, making the U.S. very reliant on imported seafood - a majority of which comes from foreign aquaculture. This makes it possible for us to enjoy easy and affordable access to our favorite seafood dinners, but this convenience and nutrition does not come without costs. 
   For example, after several decades of industrial aquaculture around the world, we have seen that large-scale fish farming may lead to marine pollution and habitat loss if it is not done correctly. Fish raised at high densities can also transmit disease more easily, which may necessitate the use of antibiotics and other medicines. And considering that many farm-raised species have limited genetic diversity, they can expose wild stocks to a host of risks - from interbreeding or co-mingling of wild stocks with potentially unhealthy fish. 
   The experience of aquaculture in Maine has cast a spotlight on many of these issues, but at the same time it provides examples of how the industry can address and overcome problems like disease and escapement. Today, nearly 150 aquaculture operations in Maine grow Atlantic salmon, oysters, mussels, and other commercially valuable seafood, growing products worth more than $80 million annually. As a pioneer in this field, Maine is finding ways to create jobs in coastal communities and sustain a vital component of the seafood economy, and ongoing research is pointing to new ways to support this industry's expansion. 
   Despite these potential challenges, the economic and public health benefits that could accompany aquaculture and the value of it in Maine make it worthwhile for us to consider the future of this industry in the United States. Currently, there is no federal framework specifically designed to address the unique regulatory issues surrounding offshore aquaculture, so in building one we must seek to prevent the mistakes and shortcomings of the past from being repeated. The administration's proposed bill for offshore aquaculture moves us in this direction, as it proposes a number of criteria aimed at ensuring environmental protection and sustainable fish farming development. 
   It is now our responsibility to critically examine this proposed bill, listen to the expert testimony provided to us today, and chart a way forward through these complex - and potentially controversial - issues. I am impressed with the caliber of the panel assembled here today, and I thank all the witnesses for appearing - Dr. Bill Hogarth of the National Marine Fisheries Service; Dr. Richard Langan of the University of New Hampshire; Mr. Randy Cates, president of Cates International, all the way from Hawaii; Mr. Mark Vinsel of the United Fishermen of Alaska; and Dr. Rebecca Goldburg of Environmental Defense. And of course, I am very grateful that our Chairman has invited Sebastian Belle, Executive Director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, to testify before us today. Sebastian, I am confident that your testimony will shed light on many of the key issues in the already complicated state-federal regulatory environment of this industry.

Daniel Inouye (D-HI) requesting that they increase funding for kidney cancer research and, more specifically, provide $15 million within the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill.  
   ""Kidney cancer is a deadly disease that is affecting increasing numbers of Americans,"" said Snowe. ""We must support research efforts that will allow medical professionals to diminish both the scope and impact of this cancer. Without the development of new tests and treatment options, those who suffer from kidney cancer will have few options for fighting this disease."" 
   The full text of the letter follows: 
   Dear Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye: 
   We are writing to respectfully request your support for increasing funding for kidney cancer research and specifically ask that you provide $15 million within the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program for this purpose in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill. 
   Kidney cancer has not received the public attention that other diseases have, though it affects a large number of people. With an estimated 12,000 deaths and 36,000 new cases in 2005, kidney cancer has, among the 20 most common cancers, the fourth highest rising incidence among women and the fifth highest among men. We hope you will consider our request to invest in diagnostic tests and new treatment options for those who suffer from this disease. 
   Mortality rates for kidney cancer patients are disturbingly high due to the lack of screening techniques that would provide early diagnosis coupled with the limited treatments that are currently available to fight the disease. Interleukin-2, the only FDA-approved drug for metastatic kidney cancer that has a durable response, has only a 5% cure rate. Unlike other types of cancer, no therapy currently exists to prevent future recurrence of kidney cancer once patients are in remission. 
   Kidney cancer is a devastating illness with inadequate treatment options that deserves dedicated research funding supported by the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. We thank you for your consideration, and look forward to a day when real hope will exist for the tens of thousands of Americans who suffer from kidney cancer.

SNOWE HIGHLIGHTS URGENCY OF HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES AFFORD HEALTH PLANS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AT FINANCE COMMITTEE HEARING ON APRIL 10
  At a Finance Committee hearing today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, cited the overwhelming burden that skyrocketing health care costs are imposing on the nation's small businesses and pressed for full Senate action on Small Business Health Plans (SBHP) also known as Association Health Plans. 
   Snowe has long fought to find common-sense ways to help small business provide health care to their employees. As such, Snowe joined with a committed group of her Senate colleagues in introducing the Small Business Health Fairness Act. This legislation would allow small businesses to pool together nationally, through Small Business Health Plans, to provide employees with quality health insurance at affordable costs. Panelists at the hearing included Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC), Todd McCracken, President, National Small Business Association, among others. 
   The following is Snowe's statement as prepared for delivery:  
   The small business health insurance crisis is real and is an undue burden on entrepreneurs throughout America. This is not a crisis that appeared overnight. Nearly 46 million Americans are now uninsured. And for the past decade - as health insurance premiums have increased at double digit percentage levels and far outpaced inflation and wage gains - Congress has failed to act. Even when study after study confirms beyond a doubt that fewer and fewer small businesses are able to offer health insurance to their employees, little has been done to alleviate the problem. Quite simply, that's outrageous. 
   The time for talking has long since passed. No more excuses, no more laments, no more complaining, no more describing a problem and doing nothing about it. I think we all can agree that we must provide small businesses in Maine, Montana, and Iowa - and in every state across our great land - with access to quality, affordable health insurance. 
   I believe that we need to focus on solutions that are achievable, tested, and fiscally prudent. I have introduced legislation, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, that would achieve this goal, through a common sense approach that would allow small businesses to pool together nationally, through Small Business Health Plans (SBHPs) that provide employees with quality health insurance at affordable costs. SBHPs will bring fairness to employer health coverage by giving participating small businesses the same advantages of Federal law currently enjoyed by larger businesses and unions. 
   I am encouraged by the considerable progress that has been made on SBHPs in this Senate - we're further along on this issue than we have ever been. But we need to go the distance, which is passing legislation that President Bush can finally sign into law. I would like to commend Senator Mike Enzi for his ongoing commitment to the SBHP issue, and for successfully marking-up SBHP legislation in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   I believe that Senator Enzi's bill is a good step forward so that we can consider this important issue on the Senate floor. I do, however, have a number of concerns with Senator Enzi's approach. First, Senator Enzi's bill fails to include a self-insured SBHP component. The ability for an SBHP to self-insure, like a large employer can, is a key component of my bill. It would inject much-needed competition into stagnant, dysfunctional small group insurance markets. It would also provide more options for small businesses when it comes to providing quality, affordable health insurance for their employees. To opponents of this approach I ask: What's wrong with competition? What's wrong with giving small businesses more choices when it comes to purchasing health insurance? 
   Second, I am concerned that a national rating standard would preempt the states' rights to regulate insurance within their borders. Under my SBHP legislation, the state insurance commissioners would rate insurance products sold in their states. Many states, including my home state of Maine, have opted to rate insurance products based on the most recent standard put out by the National Association Insurance Commissioners. 
   I also have some concerns with the way Senator Enzi's bill addresses the benefit mandate approach. I believe that associations ought to be able to tailor their SBHPs to the wants, needs, and desires of their members, but I have concerns that the high-option, low-cost option approach might lead to adverse selection and an unlevel playing field. And that the high-option approach might be priced far beyond the reach of a typical small business. 
   In the final analysis, I strongly believe that SBHPs are an idea whose time has finally come. And I look forward to debating the SBHP issue on the Senate floor in the coming weeks, and to working with my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle to fashion a bipartisan solution to this crisis. 
   While SBHPs are a crucial solution, they are not the entire solution. Today I would like to discuss several additional steps that this Committee can take, in addition to SBHPs, to help reduce the ranks of America's nearly 46 million uninsured. 
   These steps are commonsense. They are achievable. They don't add layer upon layer to a health care bureaucracy that has no shortage of red tape. And they don't call for a national health insurance program, operated and administered by the Federal government. 
   Instead, we should use the tax code to help resolve the small business health insurance crisis. Just last week I introduced the Small Business Health Insurance Relief Act (S. 2457), a bill that would both (1) provide targeted tax incentives that would encourage our nation's smallest businesses to offer health insurance; and (2) inject much-needed competition into dysfunctional state small group markets. 
   Our nation's smallest businesses - the ""micro"" businesses - are the ones least likely to offer health insurance as a workplace benefit. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Employer Health Benefits 2005 Annual Survey: only 47 percent of the smallest businesses, those with 3 to 9 workers, now offer health insurance as a workplace benefit. This is down from 52 percent in 2004, and 58 percent in 2002. Clearly, for small businesses, things are trending in the wrong direction. In sharp contrast, 98 percent of larger businesses, those with 200 or more workers, offer health insurance as a benefit. 
   My legislation would establish a targeted tax credit that would encourage the smallest businesses - those most desperately in need of relief - to purchase insurance coverage for their employees. The maximum tax credit under the proposal would be $1,500 for single coverage and $3,000 for family coverage. The tax credit would phase out as a business increases in size and is neutral between types of insurance: either traditional employer-sponsored health insurance or funding health savings accounts (HSAs) of their employees. 
   Under my legislation, a small business with five employees would be eligible for a per-participant tax credit of $3,000 for a family health insurance plan, and a potential total tax credit of $15,000. Small businesses cite escalating cost as the number one impediment to providing health insurance. Putting $15,000 in the hands of a small business owner could certainly help to overcome this barrier. 
   Second, my legislation would increase competition in state small group health insurance markets. There is no competition among insurers in the small group markets, with coverage and affordability the real problems. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) survey I recently requested, along with Senators Christopher Bond and Jim Talent, reported a frightening consolidation of control over state insurance markets. The five largest carriers now have more than 75 percent market share in 26 states (up from 19 in 2002) and more than 90 percent market share in 12 states (as opposed to 7 in 2002). Blue Cross and Blue Shield carriers now control 43 percent of the small group markets (up from 33 percent in 2002). 
   In my home state of Maine, Anthem Blue Cross now controls 63 percent of the small group market, and the five largest carriers put together dominate 98 percent. 
   To counter this market consolidation, my legislation would provide insurers with a 50 percent tax deduction for claims and expenses incurred in serving the small group market or Small Business Health Plans (SBHPs) and would provide a per state tax credit to defray the cost of state licensing requirements. These incentives are open to all insurers, and would motivate new insurers to enter and compete in the dysfunctional small group market and service SBHPs. 
   Together with SBHP legislation, I believe that these proposals could help solve the small business health insurance crisis. Simply put, our small businesses need choices as they seek to obtain affordable health insurance. In the coming weeks, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to push these proposals through the Senate. 
   I look forward to hearing the ideas and reactions of this distinguished panel.

It also highlights the SBA's pivotal role in overseeing the delivery of financial and business development tools for millions of aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small businesses across the United States. 
   ""The SBA has been a critical partner to millions of small enterprises as well as aspiring entrepreneurs as they embark on the path to prosperity and job creation,"" said Snowe. ""We must strengthen the SBA's core loan and technical assistance programs that have proven time and again to be a cornerstone in aiding the efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs.""

SNOWE URGES CONGRESS TO TAKE UP PASSENGER BILL OF RIGHTS
  Following a recent decision by a federal appeals court that the federal government, not the state, has authority over airlines, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, was joined by Sen. Barbara Boxer (R-Cali.) and passenger rights advocate Katie Hanni today to stress the urgent need for Congress to act on Passenger Bill of Right's legislation (S. 678) she introduced with Senator Barbara Boxer (R-CA) in February of 2006. 
   ""It was the outrageous delays at JFK Airport in New York in February 2007 and Katie's own traumatic experience in 2006, when she was stuck on the Austin tarmac for more than 9 hours without food or water, that first triggered calls for congressional action and for the enactment of a Passenger Bill of Rights,"" Senator Snowe recalled. ""Yet here we are more than a year later and Congress continues to drag its feet on this critical issue even as passenger satisfaction with the airlines continues to worsen.""
   ""More than a year ago, Senator Boxer and I introduced the Passenger Bill of Rights, and like all traveling Americans, we are still waiting for the Senate to act on this legislation as our bill languishes in the FAA Reauthorization,"" said Senator Snowe. ""Congress has a responsibility to the American people to ensure there is some level of accountability, some minimum standard in place. If a patron visits a restaurant that does not offer some modicum of functioning restrooms or provide adequate food and water, that customer can leave the restaurant and find another. For the airline passenger, that simply is not an option.""
   The Senate Commerce Committee passed the Boxer-Snowe Airline Passengers Bill of Rights as part of the FAA Reauthorization Bill in May 2007. The legislation ensures that travelers are not unnecessarily trapped on airplanes or deprived of food, potable water or adequate restroom facilities. The language included by the Committee also requires air carriers to develop and submit to the Secretary of Transportation their own plan, incorporating medical considerations, to ensure that passengers are provided a clear timeframe under which they will be permitted to deplane a delayed aircraft. The Secretary would be required to make the plans available to the public. In the absence of such a plan, passengers would have the option of safely deplaning a grounded aircraft three hours after the plane door has closed. This option would be provided every three hours that the plane continues to sit on the ground.

SNOWE AMENDMENT TO BOLSTER STATE'S SHARE OF HOUSING PROGRAM FUNDING PASSES SENATE
  An amendment introduced by U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was accepted as a part of the housing stimulus legislation passed today by the Senate. Her amendment would provide small states like Maine with an increased share of the additional Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program funding authorized in the housing stimulus legislation. MRBs are tax-exempt bonds that help fund below-market-interest-rate mortgages for first-time qualifying homebuyers. The allocation and distribution of MRBs are based on population - meaning larger populous areas receive a greater percentage of MRB funding. The program does have a small state funding block to ensure smaller states receive access to the MRBs. 
   The Senate's housing stimulus legislation provides an additional $10 billion in MRB's for first-time homebuyers and at-risk borrowers. This package is allocated only based on state populations. The accepted Snowe amendment provides an additional $930 million of MRBs in order to ""true up"" the amount small states would have otherwise received if there had been a $10 billion allocation with a small state minimum. Maine goes from receiving $43 million to $90 million - an increase of 110 percent.
   ""Americans throughout the country have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn and the housing crisis, so our efforts to curtail these problems must be as widespread and definitive as possible,"" Sen. Snowe said. ""For Maine, passage of this amendment would result in a 110% increase in the state's additional MRB allocation. While this amendment represents a very small portion of the bill's overall funding, its effects to states like Maine is pretty substantial.""

  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement calling for the release of a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to combat the spike in gas and oil prices that has been caused by the closure of the British Petroleum pipeline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska two days ago:  
   With the tight global supply of oil made even tighter by BP's shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, skyrocketing demand and an increasingly insecure world, there is no question that our nation is experiencing an energy crisis. Accordingly, I believe the President should release a commensurate portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counteract this latest disruption in supply that is affecting our entire nation. This is an appropriate short-term response to combat a dangerous spike in oil and gas prices that could well impact our economic growth - disproportionately affecting our most vulnerable citizens. 
  The shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay operation represents a significant decrease in supply - roughly 8 percent of America's crude oil production. This latest disruption, coupled with world events, has pushed the price of oil close to the inflation adjusted record high of $85 dollars a barrel. And it is without question that these high energy costs have an effect on our economy and must be swiftly addressed.
  The economic ripple effect of high gasoline and energy prices is most acutely felt by our country's rural communities and poorest families. Traveling throughout Maine, I have heard from countless Mainers who are struggling to cope with these current prices that could reach $3.30 a gallon. As a nation we must act - and we can act by releasing a proportionate amount of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help Americans through these difficult times.

  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV) today praised a Congressional compromise that brought about last-minute passage of three key pieces of telecommunications legislation as the Senate adjourned for the year. The legislation that passed the Senate last night by unanimous consent includes the Universal Service Fund bill that Sens. Snowe and Rockefeller authored, the Spectrum Relocation bill, and the Enhanced 911 (E-911) bill.  
   ""Last night, the Senate put politics aside in passing legislation to help schools and libraries around the country to stay connected Internet service while preventing potential increases in consumer and business phone bill fees. This bipartisan bill ensures that until a permanent fix is crafted, the status quo is preserved allowing schools and libraries to receive their Internet funding, and keeping consumers' telephone bills from rising,"" said Snowe. ""Over the course of the 108th Congress, my colleagues and I on the Commerce Committee have worked tirelessly to enact these three critical pieces of telecommunications legislation. I am pleased that all sides through hard work and determination were able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement and get these bills passed into law."" 
   ""Legislators from both sides of the aisle and from both houses of Congress came together to pass this important legislation,"" Rockefeller said. ""We know how important it is that our schools, libraries, and telephone consumers continue to have the communications services they need at a reasonable price. E-Rate, in particular, has been a wonderful success story because it has fundamentally transformed education in this country. I applaud everyone's effort to reach an agreement, and I look forward to a more permanent solution in the next Congress."" 
   More than $400 million in Universal Service Fund (USF) requests from schools and libraries have not yet been met because new Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-imposed accounting rules drastically limit the amount of funding for these programs. Without passage of this legislation, the FCC would have been forced to increase contributions to USF to meet all of the fund's commitments. That would have meant an increase in telephone fees to all residential and business customers beginning in January. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller's legislation would exempt USF from the Anti-Deficiency Act for one year. Under the exemption, E-Rate could continue issue commitment letters based on future revenue, not according to the cash-on-hand rules that the FCC began demanding in August. A more permanent fix for the program would be considered during the 109th Congress. 
   The USF suspension has delayed more than 4000 school systems' requests for E-Rate funding. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller created E-Rate as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. In 1996, only 3% of America's schools and libraries had Internet access. As of 2002, 92% were wired. A recent Government Accountability Office report showed that rural school systems, which have been particularly hard hit by the lack of funding, have used E-Rate to meet No Child Left Behind accountability mandates. 
   Also included in this package are two bills that enjoy broad support in Congress and which Snowe and Rockefeller have supported as members of the Senate Commerce Committee. Passage of the Spectrum Relocation bill will open up large amounts of radio frequencies currently used by the government for use by wireless telephone companies, Internet service providers, and public safety agencies. The bill would compensate these agencies for the costs they incur in moving to alternate frequencies by using proceeds from the auction of spectrum by the FCC to private companies. 
   The E-911 bill would ensure that fees assessed on telephone customers' bills for the purpose of funding improvements in local 911 emergency services is used by states and localities for that purpose alone - and not diverted to other uses. The legislation also provides for grants to state and local governments for enhancing emergency communication services. One of the key aims of this bill is to enable emergency responders to locate those placing 911 calls on cell phones. Currently, only land line callers can be immediately located. 
   The U.S. House of Representatives passed the same legislation in November of this year.

SNOWE LEADS DISCUSSIONS WITH PENTAGON ON ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT RESERVE CENTER AT BRUNSWICK
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) this morning called Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Mr. Thomas Hall, regarding the establishment of a Joint Reserve Center at Brunswick Naval Air Station (BNAS).Sen. Snowe express her support of the Center that has been proposed by General John Libby, the State's Adjutant General.  
   ""This morning, I spoke with Assistant Secretary of Defense Thomas Hall to discuss establishing a Joint Reserve Center at BNAS. I believe that a Reserve Center at Brunswick would not only be good for the facility and the surrounding community, but for the safety and protection of the region and, indeed, the nation. A joint reserve center at Brunswick Naval Air Station will ensure that reserve units from the different branches of the military have the flexibility to come together for improved coordination and training that is so necessary in this post 9-11 world,"" said Snowe. 
   ""The genesis of this Center is General Libby's - and I believe it demonstrates the irreplaceable current and future role of BNAS. I believe Secretary Hall was receptive to the idea and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future,"" said Snowe. 
   During this morning's call, Snowe and Hall discussed the unique strategic location and capabilities offered by BNAS. Brunswick NAS has played a role in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, both as a home to deployed squadrons as well as host to outbound and inbound aircraft and personnel; acts as the premier site for maritime patrol training and operations; and supports NATO, the Naval Reserve and nearby Naval activities, such as SUPSHIPS Bath and Bath Iron Works. 
   Next week, Secretary Hall's staff will brief Maine's congressional delegation staff on the Joint Reserve Centers.

SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL WITH SENS. SMITH, BINGAMAN TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION ON MEDICAID
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, joined Sens. Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) in cosponsoring the Bipartisan Commission on Medicaid and the Medically Underserved Act of 2005 to provide a comprehensive review of the program.  
   ""Today, I am pleased to join with my colleagues Senators Gordon Smith and Jeff Bingaman in introducing legislation that would undertake a long overdue comprehensive review of the Medicaid program and make recommendations to strengthen the program,"" said Snowe. ""With increased pressure on the Medicaid program, the federal government cannot abandon its responsibility to the states for helping to provide and expand access to health care for the low-income and uninsured Americans. We must continue to provide sufficient federal funding for Medicaid and we must proceed cautiously before making any significant changes in the program. The Medicaid Commission established by this bill would allow us to have a thorough and complete examination of the program before we undertake any alterations to a program that has proven so successful."" 
   The Medicaid Commission would be charged with a number of duties, including reviewing and making recommendations with respect to the long-term goals, populations served, financial sustainability (federal and state responsibility), interaction with Medicare and the uninsured, and the quality of care provided. 
   Snowe points to the overwhelming financial burden that states nationwide are experiencing due to Medicaid. In Maine, for example, Medicaid now consumes 26 percent of state healthcare spending. According to the National Governor's Association, total Medicaid costs are growing at a rate of 12 percent per year. Total Medicaid expenditures now exceed that of Medicare due primarily to factors beyond states' control, especially the costs of long-term care: nationally, Medicaid now accounts for 50 percent of all state long-term care spending and covers 70 percent of those in nursing homes. According to the Governor's most recent survey, Medicaid spending nationwide now averages 22 percent of overall state budgets. 
   Snowe is also concerned by the potential impact the new Medicare prescription drug program will have on Medicaid since it will shift federal expenditures for drug benefits currently provided by Medicaid to the ""dual eligible"" population - those who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare - from the Medicaid program to Medicare. However, this will not lift most of the financial responsibility and burden of their prescription drug costs from the states. 
   ""Many questions exist about the ultimate impact of the Medicare drug program on state budgets and Medicaid programs. One of the primary duties of the Medicaid Commission would be to review and make recommendations on the interaction of Medicaid with Medicare and other Federal health programs,"" continued Snowe. 
   The Medicaid Commission established by this bill would be required to review the Federal matching payments and requirements under Medicaid and make recommendations on how to make such payments more equitable with respect to the states and the populations they serve and more responsive to changes in states' economic conditions. 
   ""The tremendous complex responsibilities, financing, and interrelationships of Medicaid and Medicare demonstrate why a Medicaid Commission is absolutely necessary for the future survival of the Medicaid program. This legislation will help sustain and improve this critical health care safety net,"" said Snowe. 
   The bill's Medicaid Commission would be comprised of 23 members that reflect all the stakeholders and components in the Medicaid program. Those members include the following: 
   * One Member appointed by the President 
   * Two House members (current or former) appointed by the Speaker and Minority Leader 
   * Two Senators (current or former) appointed by the Majority and Minority Leader 
   * Two Governors designated by NGA 
   * Two Legislators designated by NCSL 
   * Two state Medicaid director designated by NASMD 
   * One Local elected official appointed by Comptroller General 
   * Four consumer advocates appointed by congressional leadership 
   * Four providers appointed by congressional leadership 
   * Two program experts appointed by Comptroller General 
   The Commission has just one a year to hold public hearings, conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, and the public. 
   This legislation has endorsements from the National Association of Community Health Centers, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Association of Counties, American Hospital Association, National Association of Children's Hospitals, National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, American Health Care Association, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, AIDS Institute, American Association of Family Physicians, among others. 
   The Medicaid program, the health insurance program jointly funded by the federal government and the states, provides essential medical services to low-income and uninsured children and their families, pregnant women, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and sometimes others. Last year nearly 55 million Americans were enrolled in the Medicaid program.

  Citizen soldiers have defended America from the very founding of our country and each soldier continues the work of generations of Americans who have served bravely before them. These soldiers are the living manifestation of what is best about our country and we thank them for keeping us safe around the world. America must always repay them with her respect and support during their times of need. 
   I would like to express my profound gratitude to a group of 80 Maine Army National Guard soldiers who are currently at Camp Atterbury in Indiana preparing to depart for a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. The Augusta-based 240th Engineer Group includes soldiers from all walks of life and all professions- including one of my very own staff members, Matt Walker. As Matt said to me before leaving for training, he was proud and prepared to represent his country and that no doubt is the same for the rest of the 240th Engineer Group. I know that our mission in Afghanistan could not be in better hands, Maine hands.  
   Another soldier that I am particularly proud of is Sergeant Derik Cormier. I recently received official confirmation from the U.S. Army that Sergeant Cormier has received a Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his bravery while serving in Iraq. He was shot in the leg during an insurgent attack in November of 2005 and he has since returned to Iraq to finish his tour of duty. Sergeant Cormier joins the ranks of other brave men and women who have received this military distinction for their outstanding valor. Derik is indeed a true son of Maine we can all be proud of. 
   Recently, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Peter Pace, returned from a seven-nation overseas tour where he met some 12,000 of our men and women in uniform. While there, he had a simple message for the enlisted men and women he was visiting in these faraway countries: ""Thank you."" But while we extend our thanks to those who are currently serving our country, we must not forget those who have finished their tour of duty and are once again living as civilians. 
   Specifically, we must consider the impact of President Bush's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 budget on veterans' health care. The President's budget proposes offsetting some of the increase in the Veterans Affairs's (VA) budget by instituting new enrollment fees and increasing co-payments for some veterans. This would force veterans to shoulder an even greater burden for their healthcare. I have long opposed such user fees and Congress has defeated similar proposals in the past. The budget also contains a 2.6 percent cost of living adjustment effective January 1, 2007 to recipients of disability compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, and clothing allowance. 
   When so many of our brave servicemen and women are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the VA's most critical priority is addressing the immediate and pressing needs of our veterans. While I am pleased that the President's budget increased funding for the VA to cope with a rising number of veterans in need of medical care, I remain adamantly opposed to allowing this additional fiscal strain to be borne by those who have served. We should never compromise our commitment to those who have given so much to our country, and I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to provide a level of funding for Veterans health care that reflects our gratitude and meets veterans' needs. 
   We must always make certain to thank our soldiers for their bravery in defending America and their commitment to the finest ideals of our nation. Soldiers now serving our country must know without a doubt that America will always stand behind them and recognize the tremendous sacrifices they have made on our behalf. I pledge to fight to make sure that this is the case, starting with ensuring that funding for our veterans health care is not threatened by budget shortfalls.

SNOWE SCRUTINIZES PRESIDENT'S 2007 HEALTH CARE BUDGET AT SENATE HEARING ON FEB. 10
  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today scrutinized President Bush's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Health Care budget at a hearing on Capitol Hill today. Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt testified before the committee. 
   Snowe issued the following statement today:
   Today, as we begin to review our national priorities for health care, we are faced with difficult choices. Access to affordable health care remains one of the foremost concerns of Americans today. As health care costs escalate and the number of uninsured Americans rises beyond 45 million, we must take steps to protect Medicare and Medicaid, not limit coverage or impede access to these essential programs. 
   That is why I was surprised and disappointed that just after Congress has taken significant steps to reduce spending in both Medicare and Medicaid, this budget proposes still more cuts - nearly $50 billion more from these two programs. For my state of Maine, some of the proposed cuts to home health care providers, nursing homes, and inpatient rehabilitation facilities would significantly impact people's access to care. 
   Clearly, there are some positive aspects in this budget to promote quality and access to care, such as continuing the expansion of community health centers and providing more funding for the President's health technology initiative. Overall, however, I am very troubled by many other aspects of the budget such as reduced funding for rural health programs and health professions training. 
   There are steps we can take to engage in more fiscal restraint in Medicare spending. We can find savings in the Medicare program that do not impact beneficiaries - for example, repealing the Medicare stabilization fund as the Senate did last year. 
   I also must say that one of the greatest concerns of the American people is the rising cost of prescription drugs, and the increasing burden this places on our citizens. Over the next ten years, the new drug benefit is now estimated to cost $724 billion. I believe we can help control these costs and keep our promise to seniors by granting the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate more competitive, better drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Competition works, as we have seen with the numerous offerings for new drug benefit plans. We should also apply these principles of competition more broadly and pass drug importation legislation to substantially lower both public and private spending and provide millions of Americans with access to affordable prescription drugs. 
   In closing, I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley and my colleagues, Secretary Leavitt, and the President to ensure that we do not undercut our essential health care programs for sake of fleeting budget savings. Doing so may appear to be the fiscally responsible course but, in the end, will merely risk long-term losses to Americans and the essential health care programs that sustain them. Today, as we begin to review our national priorities for health care, we are faced with difficult choices.

Some estimates put the drain of tax complexity on the economy at about $150 billion - when our precious resources could be channeled into more productive uses. What's worse, this complexity affects the lower-and middle income workers most acutely, because while the wealthy can afford an accountant or tax attorney, that expense is a great sacrifice to a lot of working families. What is clear is that it needs to be simplified and improved. 
   ""I commend the President for rightly establishing a bipartisan tax advisory panel, lead by two of my former colleagues - Senators Connie Mack and John Breaux - whose knowledge and ability to bridge the partisan divide will prove invaluable in coming up with innovative solutions to reform the tax code. 
   ""The bottom line is that with 2.8 million words in the internal revenue code, solutions will not come quick, nor will they be easy, but they certainly are necessary. As a member of the Finance Committee, I will remain engaged in any effort to create a tax system that is fairer for all families, more efficient for job creation and business growth and enhances the competitiveness of U.S. companies, while protecting the interests of Mainers during the process.""

DORGAN, SNOWE INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO PRESERVE INTERNET FREEDOM
  Sens. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) introduced legislation Tuesday that would ensure that Internet use - by consumers, content providers, and businesses - remains free from interference by broadband service providers.  
   The legislation, known as the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, would ensure that broadband service providers do not discriminate against Internet content, applications or services by offering preferential treatment. Some broadband providers have discussed plans to start acting like a gatekeeper on the previously open World Wide Web, capable of deciding which content can get through to consumers, and which content providers could get special deals, faster speeds, and better access to the consumer. 
   Such discrimination would ""fundamentally change the way the Internet has operated and threatens to derail the democratic nature of the Internet,"" U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) said. ""The Internet became a robust engine of economic development by enabling anyone with a good idea to connect to consumers and compete on a level playing field. The marketplace picked winners and losers, not some central gatekeeper. That freedom - the very core of what makes the Internet what it is today - must be preserved."" 
   ""Today's reintroduction of the Internet Freedom Preservation Act marks another step toward ensuring the fate of the Internet lies in the hands of its users and not the hands of a few gatekeepers,"" Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) said. ""The tide has turned in the debate between those who seek to maintain equality and those who would benefit from the creation of a toll road on the Internet super highway. The reintroduction of this legislation and the FCC's imposition of net neutrality conditions as part of the AT&T-BellSouth merger, are significant victories in the fight to ensure nondiscrimination on the Internet, and I look forward to continuing that fight along side Senator Dorgan in the new Congress."" 
   Several executives of companies that provide broadband service have publicly discussed their hope to eventually charge special fees to Internet content providers. 
   The two law-makers said their bill has the support of Internet businesses large and small, consumer groups, labor and education groups, religious organizations, and many others. Both Senators are members of the Senate Commerce Committee, which will have legislative jurisdiction over the bill. 
   Under the legislation, broadband service providers must operate the network in a nondiscriminatory manner, but would remain free to manage the network to protect the security of the network or offer different levels of broadband connection to users. They must also offer consumers the option of purchasing a ""stand alone"" broadband connection that is not bundled with cable, phone or Voice Over Internet Phone (VoIP) service. 
   Dorgan and Snowe offered similar legislation, which generated nearly one million letters and e-mails of support, in the previous Congress. The senators believed they had the votes to pass that legislation, but Senate leaders would not allow it to come to a vote. 
   In addition to Dorgan and Snowe, co-sponsors include Senators John Kerry (D-MA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), and Barack Obama (D-IL).

  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins and Representatives Tom Allen and Mike Michaud today voiced support for a resolution introduced during this morning's session by Speaker Glenn Cummings that highlighted the need for affordable housing in Maine and calling for Congressional passage of National Affordable Housing Trust Fund legislation:  
   In a joint-statement issued today, the delegation said, ""The necessity of affordable housing is such an issue that transcends party affiliation and constitutes a growing and urgent concern for many Mainers. For their leadership on this subject, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Maine's committed state leaders, especially the Speaker of the Maine State House of Representatives, Glenn Cummings."" 
   There are only 56 units of affordable and available housing in Maine for every 100 extremely low-income households. Nationally, the cost of decent, safe, and privately-owned rental housing is simply exorbitant. As of 2005, a record 37.3 million households paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs, according to the Nation's Housing 2007 Report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, and more than 17 million paid more than half their incomes for housing costs. 
   ""It's unconscionable that police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other full-time workers can't afford even modest rental housing,"" the delegation said. ""That's why we have come together to address the housing plight of low- and extremely low-income families, with a heightened focus on our vulnerable population of elderly, the homeless, and disabled residents."" 
   The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act would establish a goal to construct, rehabilitate, and preserve 1.5 million units of housing over the next 10 years and seeks to accomplish this task with funding from the proposed Government Sponsored Enterprise Affordable Housing Fund established in the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007 and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) savings that result from the enactment of the Expanding American Homeownership Act. The Trust Fund developed in this legislation would provide funds for the production of rental housing to extremely low-income families. If fully-funded, Maine would receive a minimum of $10 million in the first year alone for the development and rehabilitation of housing for those with extremely low-incomes. The bill has passed the House, and currently is under consideration in the Senate. 
   The Maine Congressional Delegation added, ""Establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund will help target housing to the extremely low-income and those who are on the brink of homelessness. The Trust Fund represents a critical step to help stem the affordable housing crisis.

SNOWE ISSUES STATEMENT ON WELFARE REAUTHORIZATION; PLEASED CHILDCARE AMENDMENT INCLUDED IN LEGISLATION
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, issued the following statement today on the Committee markup of the Welfare Reauthorization bill: 
   ""We have all had to make tough decisions, and we know that this bill has been the subject of party-line votes in the past. So I am pleased that after three years we are ready to move forward in a bipartisan manner, which provides both a vital safety net and also critical work supports to lower-income Americans. In 2003, this Committee was able to mark-up and report legislation, and I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member on their leadership in making that happen. However, as we know, there were issues that interceded on the floor that, in the end, precluded further consideration of the bill.  
   ""So clearly, we have a serious 'overdue notice' when it comes to welfare re-authorization, and it is time for us to enact a specific blueprint for TANF for the future - one that builds on past successes while addressing the shortcomings revealed by time. On that note, I believe this mark, which enhances work requirements but also improves flexibility for states to help remove barriers to employment - contains a number of positive provisions to set us on that course. 
   ""As was the case last year, the bill rightly recognizes that some families have longer-term barriers that must be faced. For example, the mark includes provisions I've supported and helped develop to count people who are care givers of a disabled dependent as meeting the requirements under certain circumstances. And the mark gives states flexibility by providing partial credit toward a state's work participation rate when there's partial compliance with hourly requirements by recipients. 
   ""Indeed, once again this year, this bill reflects a considerable, good-faith effort to close some of the political and policy gaps. Perhaps some would prefer additional work hours, for example, but again this year we are moving ahead through compromise, and I hope the full Senate will ultimately move forward because it's time that these programs had a blueprint for the future. 
   ""One provision in particular I believe must be part-and-parcel of any bill that is eventually passed is adequate child care funding. Now, I understand there are honest differences of opinion on the amount. But I believe there shouldn't be any question of the need. 
   ""And it is also true that if the aim of welfare reform is to move people off the welfare rolls and onto payrolls, providing support in the form of quality child care is a prerequisite to realizing that goal. So I am pleased the mark includes an element critical to the success of welfare reform - mandatory child care funding. There was one billion dollars in the bill we reported out of committee in September of 2003. And in March of 2004, I introduced an amendment on the Senate floor that added six billion dollars to provide additional funding for child care which passed 78-20. This would have provided a total of seven billion dollars in child care funding. 
   ""As a matter of compromise, this mark includes the original one billion dollars as well as an additional five billion in child care funding which is entirely offset. While the amount in this year's mark is less than what passed on the Senate floor just one year ago, I believe six billion in child care funding corresponds to the genuine need faced by parents trying to get off of welfare. 
   ""These offsets identify and close loopholes in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit that Congress never intended to allow. For example, Congress never intended that people living overseas, making close to a hundred thousand dollars annually to be eligible for Child Tax Credit. Similarly, loopholes currently exist that allow people with nonworking social security numbers - people who can not legally work in this country - to claim the EITC. If you are not eligible to work, you should not be able to take the EITC. Finally, these offsets correct an unintended feature of the new uniform definition of child, to ensure that the EITC goes to the most needy in our country and to clarify under which circumstances in which siblings and family members other than parents are eligible for the EITC. 
   ""I would like to thank the staffs of Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their tireless efforts in reaching this agreement. Mr. Chairman, I believe these provisions will secure the future success of TANF because they undergird the original intent of the legislation back in 1996 - and that is to assist states in helping TANF clients to move onto payrolls and to remain employed. 
   ""Moreover, as happened last year, I'm hopeful these provisions will ensure that a bill will be reported from this committee so this critical matter can be considered on the floor. And so I'm pleased the Chairman's mark once again retains many of the measures Senators Hatch, Breaux, Jeffords, Lincoln, Rockefeller and I included in our ""consensus"" bill in 2002, including child support distribution, the employment credit, education and training requirements, universal engagement provisions, and fixes to the contingency fund. 
   ""Moreover, I want to thank the Chairman for including a provision for an expanded state flexibility option - that was accepted as an amendment last year here in the Committee - based on my home state's highly successful ""Parents as Scholars"" program which allows up to 10 percent of the TANF caseload to take part in longer duration and post-secondary education. This program has been wildly successful - with graduates averaging a 50 percent increase in salaries, and with 90 percent of working graduates leaving welfare permanently. The bottom line is, increased education is another critical factor in whether a person will transition off welfare and keep a job with a decent income and I'm grateful this provision is in the Chairman's mark. 
   ""It is important to move ahead in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize this legislation precisely because it moves individuals toward self-sufficiency through vocational training and post secondary education opportunities. This legislation also contains critical provisions that ensure parents receive more of the child support money states' collect on their behalf. 
   ""In the end, once again, we have a responsibility to learn from the past eight years - to augment successes and address the weaknesses. But most of all, we have an obligation to pass a bill into law for the over two million families who remain on the caseloads as well as those who are receiving work supports through TANF - the overwhelming majority of whom want nothing more than to travel a path that leads to permanent self-sufficiency. My sincere hope is that cooperation will continue to be the watchword in ensuring we fight off any contentious amendments that may arise during floor debate so we can get this done this year.""

SNOWE, COLLINS ANNOUNCE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR PRIDE MANUFACTURING WORKERS IN GUILFORD
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today announced that displaced Pride Manufacturing workers in Guilford, Maine have been granted Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).  
   ""The economic hardship faced by workers and their families when a company is forced to close is always difficult,"" said Snowe and Collins in a joint statement. ""In order to be able to rejoin the workforce in a timely manner, it is imperative that the laid-off workers of Pride Manufacturing receive support and additional training. The services provided by TAA and ATAA will be instrumental in getting these workers back on their feet."" 
   The workers at Pride Manufacturing produced wood products, including shapes, knobs, and gallery rail spindles. Sales and employment have decreased compared to last year due to an increase in similar imported goods so the company has been forced to close its doors. 
   Because the TAA and ATAA petitions were approved by the Department of Labor, the displaced workers of Pride Manufacturing will have access to such benefits as training, education, job search and relocation allowances, and re-employment services including counseling, interview training, and resume assistance. Health care tax credits and unemployment benefits extensions are also established for a company that has received TAA certification. 
   Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is a program for older workers displaced by trade. It is granted if a significant number of workers at the firm are age 50 or over and possess skills that are not easily transferable.

SNOWE SUPPORTS VICE ADMIRAL THAD ALLEN'S NOMINATION TO BE COAST GUARD COMMANDANT
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Fisheries, participated today in a full Commerce Committee Hearing on the nomination of Vice Admiral Thad Allen to be Commandant of the Coast Guard. 
   The following is Snowe's statement as prepared for delivery:  
   As Chair of the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, and a representative of a state with a long and proud maritime heritage, I am pleased to address leadership transition of the United States Coast Guard. The current Commandant will complete his tour of duty on May 25th, and it is now imperative that the Senate considers and confirms his successor. 
   First, let me express my deep appreciation for the outstanding leadership of Admiral Tom Collins. For the past four years, he has carried out his duties as Commandant with distinction and remarkable accomplishment, particularly during the tumultuous aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The brave men and women of the Coast Guard performed heroically in saving more than 33,000 lives under disastrous conditions never before faced in this country, which is a testament to his outstanding leadership. 
   Since then, Admiral Collins and his Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Thad Allen, have worked tirelessly to ensure the Coast Guard is ready to respond to any threat. With their sure and steady hands at the helm, they upheld the Coast Guard's readiness under challenging circumstances and have been at the forefront in facilitating the Deepwater project - which is not only urgent and essential for upgrading the Coast Guard's aging assets but also for shoring up the very foundation of our nation's homeland security. As the Coast Guard has increasingly been called upon to do more with less - with the 40th oldest fleet among the world's 42 nations with maritime forces - they have navigated these treacherous waters effectively and with impressive diligence. 
   Given the threats we face today - whether natural disasters or the products of discontent societies - it is vital that the new Commandant of the Coast Guard maintains this course, and I have every confidence that Vice Admiral Allen is the right person for the job. As the Chairman noted, the nominee before us today has compiled a long and distinguished record in the service of our nation. Serving as Admiral Collins' Chief of Staff for the past four years, he has been instrumental in guiding the transition of the Coast Guard to its new normalcy in the post-9/11 environment. 
   Looking forward, the challenges facing our nation, and the Coast Guard, under Admiral Allen's leadership will only continue to grow. The Coast Guard must continue to be an integral component of our nation's military and a vigilant defender of our homeland security. While we have seen the Department of Homeland Security rightfully come under scrutiny during recent national events, including its roles in natural disasters and port security oversight, the Coast Guard has consistently demonstrated an outstanding ability to carry out its missions each and every time, and it must continue to do so. No Coastie better demonstrated the service's ""get it done attitude"" better than Admiral Allen, who confidently stepped into a critical leadership role and righted the federal government's response to Katrina. His ability to coordinate the efforts of all local, state, and federal agencies into one harmonious response should be the model to emulate when the next disaster strikes. 
   As our nation has painfully learned over recent weeks and months, there is simply no substitute for maintaining a ready posture when it comes to protecting our homeland. The recent firestorm over the proposed sale of critical ports terminals to Dubai Ports World has highlighted the vulnerabilities in our port security. Our nation requires a Coast Guard that can provide us with secure ports, and, Admiral Allen, I believe that is going to be the greatest challenge of your tenure. 
   Yet beyond these headline-grabbing cases, every single day the Coast Guard must continue to work tirelessly, outside the spotlight, to uphold our nation's safety and security. Through its search and rescue operations, this service aids people in distress and prevents the losses of life and property on our waters. The Coast Guard enforces all federal laws and treaties related to the high seas and U.S. waters and prevents illegal narcotics from reaching our shores. This service is the lead federal agency for preventing and responding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. At the same time, it makes our ports and shipping lanes safe for efficient maritime transportation and commerce. And as one of the armed services, it plays a critical role in our nations's defense strategies. Under your watch, Admiral Allen, the Coast Guard's vital role in each of these missions will undoubtedly continue to have direct bearing on our nation's security and welfare. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am impressed with Vice Admiral Allen's credentials for the Coast Guard's highest leadership position. The president could not have chosen a more qualified individual for this critical position. I look forward to his testimony and to working with him on the safety and security issues so critical to our nation, and I again thank you for scheduling this vital hearing today.

SNOWE FIGHTS TO STOP DRILLING IN ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) spearheaded a letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) urging him not to include a provision to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution. Joining Sen. Snowe on the letter are Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lincoln Chafee (R-RI).  
   ""I firmly believe that the budget resolution is not an appropriate place to debate drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,"" said Snowe. ""This provision could prove to be a poison pill during consideration of the budget. Congress should not be making environmental and energy policy decisions of this magnitude on the budget bill."" 
   The text of the letter is below: 
   Dear Judd; 
   We are writing to express our opposition to any language or mechanism in the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Resolution that assumes revenues from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or allows for the insertion of any provision that opens the Coastal Plain of the Refuge to oil and gas drilling and exploration. While we share your desire to develop a fiscally responsible budget blueprint, inclusion of language related to the Refuge will once again create unnecessary controversy in the U.S. Senate. We also strongly oppose the inclusion of any reconciliation instructions regarding the Arctic Refuge for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the Budget Resolution. 
   We do not feel it is appropriate to debate drilling in the Arctic Refuge as part of the Budget Resolution. As you know, the budget process was designed to ensure that important fiscal matters be debated and decided swiftly. Congress should not be making environmental and energy policy decisions of this magnitude on the budget bill. 
   We thank you for your past leadership on this issue, and ask that you assist us once again to promote a common Republican agenda for both energy and fiscal responsibility. Any requests that are intended to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling and exploration threaten our ability to maintain such an agenda and should not be included in the Budget Resolution. 
   Thank you for your serious consideration of this matter.

SNOWE CHAIRS SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE HEARING ON PRESIDENT'S FY 2007 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION BUDGET
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) delivered the following statement today at a Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship hearing that she chaired on the Bush Administration's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Budget for the Small Business Administration (SBA): 
   At a small business forum earlier this year President Bush said, ""Small businesses have been a driving force behind the tremendous growth and job creation of recent years. By adopting sound policies that help our small businesses continue to grow and expand, we will keep the economy moving forward and extend prosperity and hope in our country."" 
   Prosperity and hope do, indeed, embody the spirit of the 25 million small business owners in our country. They take risks others don't. They transform their ideas and dreams into realities. Their hobbies become their professions. Their entrepreneurial spirit is everywhere, and their products and services have made the United States the most prosperous, powerful and generous country on earth.  
   Small businesses represent 99 percent of all employers, create nearly 75 percent of all net new jobs, and employ 51 percent of the private-sector workforce. They are the foundation, the base, the core of our economy. America is America because of our small businesses. 
   Given these facts, I am truly disappointed by the proposed funding level of $624 million for the Small Business Administration for Fiscal Year 2007. Excluding the Disaster Loan program, only $425 million will go to the SBA's core programs, which continues a trend of decreasing SBA budgets over the last 6 years that have reduced those programs by 25 percent in that period, as you can see in this chart. Moreover, since 2001, SBA proposes to reduce its overall budget by an astounding 37 percent! The SBA's budget represents less than 3/100ths of a percent of the total federal budget. Is this really the place for the Administration to find additional savings? 
   The SBA argues that it ""does more with less,"" but the Agency's resources and employees are stretched too thin. We cannot, on one hand, cite how important small businesses are to our country and our economy, and, on the other hand, refuse to provide the Small Business Administration with the resources it requires to meet its mission. 
   And when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf region, the SBA desperately needed a full complement of resources to respond to this unprecedented disaster. As we have learned, the Agency's Disaster Credit Management System was incapable of handling the high volume of disaster loan applications - nearly 350,000 have been received so far - and the SBA failed to accurately monitor its disaster financial information and to implement its disaster transformation workforce strategy. This tragic response to a tragic and devastating disaster must not be repeated. 
   I have led the effort to push the agency to improve its loan processing activities and I have consistently demanded that the SBA provide more effective relief to the hurricane victims. I urged SBA officials - publicly and privately - to process Hurricane disaster loans with greater urgency and efficiency. Specifically, among other things, I asked the SBA to: 
   * Develop a comprehensive disaster response plan that accommodates different scales of 
   disasters; 
   * Improve the process for accurately predicting disaster loan volumes; 
   * Work with local resource partners to determine their individual needs to better coordinate 
   disaster relief efforts; 
   * Hire additional employees for processing centers, including business loan officers and data entry staff to meet the current demand; and 
   * Hire additional Loss Verification Officers to analyze damaged homes and businesses. 
   To date, while the SBA has resolved over 90 percent of small business disaster loans and over 73 percent of all disaster loan applications submitted by victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for a total of $5.7 billion, the largest outstanding problem is that only $450.6 million of that total has actually been disbursed thus far, and I urge the SBA, as I have been doing for over six months now, to improve its processes and get more money out to the people who need it. 
   Beyond the doors of the SBA, are volumes of small business success stories that remain untold. From the local mom and pop shop to Ben and Jerry's ice cream, the SBA and its programs have a tremendous return on investment, helping to create or retain over 4.5 million jobs since 1999. 
   Small businesses yearn to grow, flourish and thrive and the SBA has the experience and the resources to be their bridge to success. However, a steady decline in the SBA's budget could jeopardize its ability to provide this positive economic stimulus in the future. More importantly, if we fail to provide sufficient support to SBA's core lending and business development programs, we threaten to reduce small businesses' ability to compete. 
   In addition to analyzing the SBA's declining budget request, I am deeply concerned about the SBA's plan to charge additional fees on small businesses in the 7(a), 504, and Small Business Investment Company programs. These are highly successful programs. None of them receives appropriations to subsidize its loans. Last year, at no cost to the taxpayer, the 7(a) program provided over $14 billion in small business loans, the 504 program provided over $10 billion in loans, and the SBIC program provided $2.9 billion. Now, the Administration proposes to increase fees on small businesses to raise $7 million in revenue, which will be used for the SBA's administrative costs. Increasing fees paid by small businesses is not the way to reduce the budget. These small businesses are already paying fees and taxes to fund the Agency. Let's not make it more costly for them to get financing. 
   SBA loan programs have produced success story after success story, which include Eric Thorson, the Administration's nominee to be the SBA's next Inspector General. At a hearing last week Mr. Thorson told the Committee that he began his small business with an SBA veterans loan after returning from a tour of duty in Vietnam. SBA loans have also assisted the founders of Federal Express, Outback Steak House, Calloway Golf, and thousands of other successful businesses. 
   The Administration is also proposing that Disaster Loan borrowers be required to pay a higher interest rate after the first five years of their loan, to lower the cost of disaster loans by a total of $41 million for FY2007. Putting a greater burden on disaster victims is a short-sighted policy that Congress should not adopt, and I strongly oppose this proposal. 
   I also intend to fight any attempt to eliminate the SBA's Microloan Program, which provides loans of up to $35,000 and technical assistance to new and growing small businesses. This relatively inexpensive program helps entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses throughout our nation. In my own State of Maine, almost 90 loans have been made in the program over the last two years, for a total of over $1 million. It has a proven record of helping small businesses that could not get any other financing, and the Administration's proposal would eliminate this crucial source of small business growth. 
   I will continue to oppose the Administration's proposals to insufficiently fund programs such as the Small Business Development Centers, Veteran's Business Development, and Women's Business Centers which served over 1 million clients in 2005. Not only have these programs have been level-funded for the last 4 years but this year the SBA proposed to decrease their funding. These programs have exceeded their potential and it is time to provide them with the necessary resources they need to reach and assist more small businesses. 
   During the course of this hearing, I also wish to examine the Agency's funding and management of government contracting and business development programs, which are subject to your executive direction. 
   According to reports prepared by the Government Accountability Office and the SBA's Inspector General last year, the SBA failed to review over 80 percent of bundled contracts, the SBA's oversight of prime contract awards and of the 8(a) program are among the Agency's major management challenges, and large contractors at the Department of Energy have repeatedly overstated their subcontracting achievements. Despite your claims last year to increase the government contracting and business development budget by 5 percent, the budget actually saw a $5 million decrease. I applaud your decision to reverse this decline in 2007, but I am skeptical that your agency will follow through. 
   I think we all can agree that small businesses are essential to America's success, and that the SBA is a vital help to small businesses. We would be remiss to accept the status quo, rather than vigorously seek improvements. 
   The American economy needs a strong and vibrant Small Business Administration. This Committee is here to help improve the SBA in any way possible to ensure the success of tomorrow's entrepreneurs. Of course, the agency has been subjected to criticism, including my own. I do this in the hope that we can move beyond criticism and find solutions to the problems so the SBA will exhibit the same passion for excellence found in the entrepreneurs it serves. That is why we are here today.

SNOWE WORKS TO KEEP FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY PROGRAM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and 44 of her Senate colleagues sent a letter to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Ranking Member Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) urging them to oppose budget cuts to the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program. The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 budget proposes 25% in cuts to this program. 
   ""CDBG funds are essential to providing affordable housing to low-income people in communities across our nation,"" said Snowe. ""It would be irresponsible to cut funding for this program by 25 percent and leave struggling families without access to homes and shelter. I hope that congress supports this program and fully funds it in order to ensure that we are adequately addressing the housing needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens.""  
   The CDBG program provides billions of dollars in flexible funding to states, localities, and other community organizations for economic development and public works projects. Maine's CDBG program provides funding and technical support for projects that achieve local community and economic development objectives, while principally benefiting Maine's residents with low-to-moderate income. These programs are only available to Maine towns, cities and counties for the benefit of Maine residents. 
   Since 1998, Maine communities have received $23.4 million in funding for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects and over that same time nearly 3,800 jobs have been created through CDBG funding. Regardless, Maine's CDBG allocation was cut from $31.7 million in 2005 to $28.9 million in 2006. 2007 funding is expected to be reduced to $21.7 million which would equate to a loss in Maine of $10 million in funding from 2005 to 2007. 
   The text of the letter is below: 
   Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: 
   As you near consideration of the FY 2007 Budget Resolution, we urge the Budget Committee to oppose the budget proposal to cut funding for the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) Program by nearly $1 billion, or 25 percent. Instead, we urge the Budget Committee to maintain the Federal government's commitment to community development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and support a budget allocation of $4.3 billion in Function 450 for CDBG. 
   The communities that have benefited from CDBG will be devastated if the HUD proposal to cut funding is enacted. CDBG serves more than 1,100 entitlement communities, urban counties and states, and more than 3,000 rural communities nationwide. It is the centerpiece of the Federal government's efforts to help states and localities meet the needs of low-income communities. The Program funds vital homeownership, housing rehabilitation, public improvements, public services and economic development projects in communities nationwide. It also supports community-based organizations and the crucial work they do to deliver human services and rebuild neighborhoods. 
   CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results. Over 95 percent of the FY 2005 CDBG funding went to activities principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. Twenty-eight percent of CDBG funds supported housing activities in distressed communities, 24 percent supported public improvements, 15 percent went to the provision of public services, and 7 percent supported economic development activities. In FY 2005, CDBG housing projects assisted over 166,000 households, including financial assistance to new homeowners and rehabilitation assistance to the elderly and other existing homeowners. Economic development programs benefiting from CDBG last year created or retained over 91,000 full-time jobs. CDBG also has a strong record in business retention: CDBG has ensured that over 80 percent of the businesses assisted through the program were still in operation after three years. 
   The CDBG formula allocation was funded at $4.41 billion in FY 2001. Since then, the formula allocation has decreased by $670 million, or 15.2 percent, with a five percent cut in FY 2005 and a 10 percent cut in FY 2006. The FY 2007 HUD budget would reduce the formula funding by an additional 25 percent, cutting the formula allocation by over a third in just three years. 
   In light of these drastic cuts, communities have struggled to continue their programs and have discontinued critical projects for low- and moderate-income persons. We therefore ask you to reject the proposed cut and ask you to support $4.3 billion in funding for the CDBG Program. 
   Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to working with you to ensure that communities across the country can provide good jobs, affordable housing, and public services to meet the needs of all Americans.

  As all Mainers know far too well, our winters are long and cold - and this one is still far from over. While our temperatures continue to stay low, our home heating oil prices continue to stay almost unaffordably high. Low-income families, senior citizens, and disabled individuals have been especially hard-hit. They often bear an unfair burden spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills and each year this burden grows as natural gas, heating oil and propane prices continue to increase. 
   In 1981, Congress took a common sense step by instituting the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This federally-funded program is essential to ensuring that low-income families across the nation are able to afford to heat and cool their homes during the winter and summer months. Each year, almost 5 million low-income households across the country receive LIHEAP assistance. Without this funding, many families would be forced to make impossible decisions between heating their homes and other necessities such as food, rent and prescription drugs.  
   Since 2001, average household heating oil expenditures have risen from $627 to $1,474; natural gas from $465 to $1000; and propane from $736 to $1,286. On top of this, since the winter of 2001-2002 to this year's winter, the LIHEAP program has decreased its buying power for a household's annual heating oil cost from 50.9% to 19.5%. In dollar terms, this means that Americans that qualify and receive money from the LIHEAP program are paying roughly $847 more than they did in 2001. This spike in prices has left eleven states across the country including Maine without any more winter heating funds for this winter. But in personal terms for families with low-incomes and elderly on fixed incomes, this increase is often more than they can bear. 
   Unfortunately, this essential program has historically been vastly underfunded, but in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when our energy costs soared, I became determined to make sure that was not the case this year. Before Congress recessed last year, I forged an agreement with Senate Majority Bill Frist (R-TN) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) for a Senate vote on an emergency bill to provide additional funding for LIHEAP. The legislation that I authored provides $1 billion in funding for LIHEAP for Fiscal Year 2006. On March 2nd of this year, the Senate finally passed my emergency funding bill which will make funding quickly available to help cold weather states like Maine. 
   The Senate has done the right thing by passing emergency LIHEAP legislation to help families struggling with record-high fuel prices keep warm this winter. A cold winter is still a reality in many states, and the remaining cold weather months threatened countless Mainers and Americans faced with high fuel prices and LIHEAP funding that has already run out. I am pleased that the tireless work of a group of committed Senators and our Senate leadership has resulted in the additional resources that will keep so many low-income families and seniors warm this winter. We set out to secure immediate LIHEAP funding for cold weather states like Maine and the Senate has finally accomplished that goal. 
   LIHEAP's value cannot be overstated since it provides a vital safety net for the nation's low-income households and works to help them maintain economic stability. There should be no question about what to do when it comes to helping our most vulnerable citizens survive throughout the remainder of this winter and I applaud my colleagues for doing the right thing and funding this vital program. Given the efficacy and importance of LIHEAP, I pledge to continue my fight for low-income fuel assistance throughout my tenure in the Senate. 
   Individuals interested in applying for LIHEAP assistance should contact their local/state LIHEAP agency or click on the agency directory at: www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/liheap/directry.htm. The directory can help people locate the state or tribal office that administers LIHEAP funds in communities across the country.

  U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced today a bipartisan resolution to recognize National Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Education and Awareness Month in March. 
   ""I am pleased to introduce this Resolution which recognizes and reaffirms our commitment to combating Multiple Sclerosis,"" said Senator Casey. ""By promoting awareness of its causes and risks and by promoting new education programs, supporting research and expanding access to medical treatment, we can work to find a cure. It is also my hope that this Resolution that Senator Snowe and I offer today will help us to more consciously recognize all Americans living with Multiple Sclerosis.""
   ""We live in an age of possibility, where all that stands in the way of curing our most degenerative illnesses is the will and commitment to do so,"" Senator Snowe said. ""Too little is known about this disease that affects hundreds and thousands of Americans. In an age where technology and innovation have launched a new race for medical achievement, we have the opportunity and obligation to find a cure for M.S.""
   The resolution introduced today states MS affects approximately 400,000 Americans of all ages, genders, races and ethnicities. Multiple Sclerosis is a disease in the central nervous system without a cure. It affects a patient's immune system and the cause is still unknown.

  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Susan Collins (R-ME), and Reps. Tom Allen (D-ME) and Michael Michaud (D-ME) sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Gale Norton urging the maintenance of $70,000 in funding for Maine's hatcheries. The U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) has redirected the funding from Region 5, Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 and 2005 budgets from the Green Lake and Craig Brook National Fish Hatcheries in Maine to other projects under its jurisdiction in the region.  
   ""The wild Atlantic salmon was once very abundant in Maine rivers. At one time thousands of adults would return to our rivers and streams to spawn. Now we have just over 1,200 adults returning - most to the Penobscot River. The recovery of this national treasure has brought together federal and state agencies, several Native American tribes, and dozens of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in what can only be described as one of the most prolific and cooperative fishery restoration projects in the country,"" the delegation letter said. 
   ""The USFWS is jeopardizing Maine's salmon restoration efforts with mid-year budget cuts of $70,000. This cut goes beyond fish. It is directed at the spirit of cooperation that the USFWS has entered into with the State of Maine, the NGO partners and the Penobscot Indian Nation. We do not take this erosion of trust lightly,"" the letter said. 
   A redirection of FY04 funds, totaling an estimated $70,000, will cut hatchery production by 50 percent and eliminate the captive reared broodstock program. Furthermore, 80 percent of the $92,000 that was dedicated to Fisheries Operation Needs (FON's) has been redirected to other areas within the Region, impacting the ability to do proper genetic work on salmon from rivers that have been listed under the Endangered Species Act. This has long-term implications related to the Distinct Population Segment (DPS) broodstock being held at Craig Brook. 
   ""While a $70,000 cut seems small to Region 5's overall budget, the impact to Maine's salmon restoration efforts are far reaching. For instance, the Penobscot River salmon returns are now back over 1,000 adults with 300+ females. Currently 550,000 smolts are stocked on an annual basis to help facilitate this return. With the proposed cuts only 275,000 smolts will be available in FY05. The effect of this reduction will be seen in 2007 when adult returns are projected to drop below 300 with less then 80 females. The reduction in spawning females will jeopardize the genetic viability of salmon in the Penobscot River - a river we understand is undergoing a biological review for potential listing under the Endangered Species Act. 
   The delegation noted that Secretary Norton, based on a recently published opinion piece in the Bangor Daily News is a strong supporter of the Penobscot River restoration effort, which is currently underway, and that she understands the benefits that this effort has to Atlantic salmon - the keystone species for this project. 
   The decline in the Penobscot River returns will jeopardize the U.S. seat at the international salmon management table. The United States is a current and active member of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO). The U.S. has this seat, in part, because of the run of fish on the Penobscot. The US participation at NASCO was instrumental in organizing the buyout of the West Greenland fishery saving thousands of North American Atlantic salmon. 
   These budget cuts have impacts beyond the Penobscot River. The Saco River Salmon Club has a restoration project that currently has one of the best return rates of any stocked river in New England. This program depends on eggs, parr and smolt that are supplied by the Green Lake Hatchery. Eggs will no longer be available, eliminating the natural run of Atlantic salmon and leaving the membership of the Club with a hatchery that will still have a mortgage to pay on it. Further up the coast on the Union River, another dedicated group of volunteers has built a hatchery and spent thousands of dollars gearing up for eggs in 2006 - this hatchery will not open. International cooperation with Canada with the St. Croix River smolt-stocking program will be damaged because of the lack of available smolts. The ASC is spending thousands of dollars on in stream incubation systems within the Kennebec Drainage - this project will be eliminated. Finally, the Fish Friends Program, which involves the rearing of Atlantic salmon eggs in 150 classrooms, will be reduced by an estimated 100 classrooms affecting the education of 3,000 Maine school children. 
   ""Atlantic salmon are a highly valued natural resource for the State of Maine and the nation. We would urge you to direct the National and Regional Directors to readjust the FY04 budget so that Maine's restoration efforts are not compromised. We look forward to hearing from you within the next two weeks as to what corrective measures can be taken,"" the letter concluded.

""Given their extensive community involvement activities, I am not surprised that they were chosen to receive this honor. Both of these enterprising and selfless young women serve as role models to youth and adults across the state of Maine. Their dedication to their communities and their causes is inspiring."" 
   The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards honors young people in middle level and high school grades for outstanding volunteer service to their communities. Created in 1995 by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), the awards constitute the United States' largest youth recognition program based solely on volunteering. Over the past 11 years, the program has honored more than 70,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level. 
   Two young Americans-one high school student and one middle-level student-in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are named State Honorees in the 2006 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program. These Honorees receive $1,000 awards, engraved silver medallions, and an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. for four days of recognition events. 
   Kathleen Casasa-Blouin, 18, of Portland, Maine, a senior at Deering High School, helps plan and lead counseling programs to ease the emotional trauma that children typically experience when their parents divorce or separate. Kathleen first became involved in this cause as a fund-raiser for the Kids First Center in Portland, which offers divorce support-group sessions for children and adolescents. After raising more than $350 to help kids from low-income families attend the program, she began volunteering as a co-facilitator at the center, helping a social worker conduct 1?-hour sessions for kids 5 to 14 years old once a week for six weeks. Kathleen helps plan a theme for each session, leads discussions, organizes activities, and assists in other ways. 
   Kerry Kay, 14, of Bath, Maine, an eighth-grader at Bath Middle School, volunteers to help Alzheimer's patients at a local nursing home, collects food and other donations for an animal shelter, and makes sandwiches for local firefighters and policemen. At the nursing home, Kerry organized a ""Red Hat"" activities group for Alzheimer's patients after observing how much happier the patients seemed when other people were around them. With help from her mother and the home's activities director, Kerry planned projects, collected red hats and other fun items, helped the patients take part in the activities, and took pictures to create a display board for patients and their families. When Kerry learned that the animal shelter needed food and other items, she created collection boxes and organized a donation campaign at her school. She also made and delivered ""hero"" sandwiches to thank firefighters and police officers for their work.

SNOWE TO OFFER AMENDMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLAN BILL
  Today Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, called for Senate passage of an amendment to S.1955, a bill currently being considered by the Senate that would allow small businesses to pool together through Small Business Health Plans (SBHPs) in order to offer affordable health insurance to their employees. 
   Snowe's amendment aims to build bipartisan support for the bill by requiring that SBHPs protect the benefits adopted by a majority of states and limiting the scope of benefit preemption to group health insurance markets, leaving the individual insurance market as-is. SBHPs give small businesses the same market-based advantages and competitive leverage that large employers and unions enjoy when providing employees health insurance, and they have the potential to substantially reduce the ranks of the uninsured. Last year Snowe introduced her own version of SBHP legislation, S.406, and she first introduced such legislation in 2003 after discussions with constituents and small businesses in Maine.  
   ""The health insurance crisis continues in Maine and across the country, with nearly 46 million Americans going without health insurance,"" said Snowe. ""SBHPs will move us forward in dealing with this crisis, but I have been concerned with the way in which we address state benefit mandates. I and many of my colleagues have fought for years for comprehensive health care coverage, and we believe that widely accepted, critical protections for patients must be preserved in any SBHP legislation the Senate ultimately adopts. The amendment I will soon offer is a carefully crafted compromise that would maintain protections on which there is broad consensus, while allowing SBHPs to tailor their plans to the needs of their members. I believe my amendment can serve as a foundation for building the bipartisan support necessary for the Senate to pass a bill that will allow small businesses to afford insurance for their employees."" 
   Of the nearly 46 million uninsured Americans, approximately 60 percent work for a small business. The Congressional Budget Office has conservatively estimated that 600,000 uninsured individuals would become insured if this legislation were passed, and other studies have concluded that as many as 8.5 million people might gain health insurance through small business health insurance plans. 
   ""This is a watershed moment - the Senate has an opportunity to provide health insurance for millions of uninsured Americans and to aid small businesses that are struggling to offer insurance to their employees,"" said Snowe. ""I call on my Senate colleagues to listen to their uninsured constituents and the small business communities in their states and put aside partisan differences to pass legislation that addresses a national problem in a responsible way."" 
   Snowe's amendment would limit the scope of benefit mandate preemption under S. 1955 by: 
   (1) Requiring that SBHPs protect the benefits which are adopted in a majority of states. According to the Council for Affordable Health Insurance (CAHI), the benefits that would be covered in 26 states include: alcoholism treatment, breast reconstruction, contraceptive coverage, diabetic supplies, emergency services, mammography, maternity stay, mental health -general and mental health parity, off-label drug use, and prostate screening. If one of these benefits exists in at least 26 states, an SBHP would have to include that benefit in those states. 
   (2) Limiting the scope of preemption. Senator Snowe's amendment would limit the preemption of benefit mandates to SBHPs, the small group insurance market, and the large group insurance market. Senator Snowe's amendment would ensure that the individual insurance market would not be subject to benefit mandate preemption.

SNOWE CALLS FOR STRICTER FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS FOR CARS, TRUCKS
  At a Commerce Committee hearing this morning, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) called on Congress to dramatically increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for automobiles as well as light trucks and SUVs. At the hearing, she discussed legislation that she is introducing today with Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) that calls for all vehicle fleets to get 10 miles more per gallon (mpg) over the next ten years by 2016.  
   ""Our nation is yet again experiencing sky-rocketing gasoline prices that are sending shock waves throughout our economy. While the Bush Administration should be commended for taking some initial action to increase the fuel economy standards for SUVs, I believe it is imperative that Congress not abrogate its responsibility in setting CAFE standards,"" said Snowe. ""We should consider legislation I have introduced today with Senator Feinstein that requires vehicle fleets, including SUVs to average 10 miles more per gallon by 2016. This will finally fully close the SUV loophole. It has been estimated by the Union of Concerned Scientists that, by 2025, our bill will save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day."" 
   According to the National Academy of Sciences, the technology to raise fuel economy standards by 10 miles per gallon is available and could be carried out on a fleet-wide basis. In other words, companies can average their entire fleet of SUVs, trucks and cars to reach an average of 35 mpg by 2016. 
   Last month, the Bush Administration announced an incremental increase in the miles per gallon of the light truck category to 22.2 mpg by model year 2007. Snowe and Feinstein have long fought to close the SUV loophole to raise SUVs up to the passenger car standard of 27.5 mpg. Currently, the U.S. combined CAFE average is 24.8 mpg. 
   Snowe and Feinstein wrote to Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Ranking Member Daniel Inouye (D-HI) on Apil 27th, requesting a hearing on CAF? standards.

SNOWE URGES $2 MILLION INCREASE FOR FISHERIES BUDGET
  Concerned that insufficient federal funding will threaten New England's hatcheries, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) has joined a bipartisan group of New England Senators in petitioning Senate conferees to support a $2 million increase in funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) budget for the fisheries. USFWS' budget is included in the fiscal year (FY) 2005 Interior Appropriations bill currently being reconciled in a House-Senate conference committee.  
   ""I unequivocally believe that the hatcheries, which play a critical role in restoring Atlantic salmon to Maine's waters and must be Fish & Wildlife Services' top priority. Federal law mandates the recovery of this endangered species, which will benefit Maine and the entire nation, "" Snowe stated. ""I am committed to securing these needed resources for the successes of Maine and New England's Atlantic Salmon hatcheries projects."" 
   Snowe, who is chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries and Coast Guard, has long fought to sustain funding for Maine's hatcheries programs. In May, Snowe pressed USFWS to take any and all steps necessary to distribute $70,000 in federal funding allocated under the FY 2004 Interior Appropriations to the Green Lake and Craig Brook National Fish Hatcheries in Maine. The funding, originally designated to Atlantic Salmon hatcheries in Maine, was redirected to other projects under Fish & Wildlife Service's Region 5 - which includes Maine - due to FWS' budget restraints. Additionally, Snowe requested $15 million in the Senate FY 2005 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill for Atlantic Salmon recovery efforts in Maine. 
   ""Budget shortfalls will also trigger a nearly 80 percent reduction in Atlantic salmon fry stocking and a 50-100 percent reduction in smolt stocking in the Connecticut River; a 60-70 percent reduction in Atlantic sa6lmon fry stocking and a 50-100 percent reduction in salmon smolt stocking for the Merrimack River; a 60-70 percent reduction in salmon fry propagation for the Pawcatuck-Wood River in Rhode Island; a reduction of broodstock support for the Merrimac River Atlantic Salmon Recreational Fishery of 50-100 percent; and a reduction of at least 50 percent in salmon egg production for the Saco, Kennebec, and Union rivers in Maine. In addition, USFWS may have to cut outreach and habitat assessment activities and technical assistance to state partners,"" the bipartisan letter to the conferees read.

SNOWE: TERMS OF AGREEMENT SHOULD BE MET
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today joined 10 of her colleagues requesting United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab take the necessary steps to apply the terms of a softwood lumber trade settlement between the United States and Canada retroactively to October 1, 2006. The terms of the settlement signed September 12, were originally scheduled to begin on October 1st but have been delayed following requests from Canadian lumber producers seeking more time to comply with the agreement's requirement that private lawsuits filed against the United States be dropped. The United States and Canada settlement calls for the replacement of U.S. corrective duties totaling 10.8% with a Canadian export tax of approximately 15%. 
   ""The efforts by the Canadian lumber industry to delay the application of the settlement agreed to by both the Canadian and U.S. government should not be allowed or rewarded,"" Senator Snowe said. ""Each day the terms of the deal are delayed, is an another day the Canadian softwood lumber is allowed into the United States at artificially reduced prices putting thousands of Maine jobs at risk.""  
   The following letter was authored by Senator Craig (R- Idaho) and signed by Senators Snowe (R-Maine), Cochran (R-Mississippi), Collins (R-Maine), Enzi (R-Wyoming), Lott (R-Mississippi), Shelby (R-Alabama), Smith (R-Oregon), Crapo (R-Idaho), Chambliss (R-Georgia), and Burns (R-Montana) and sent to Ambassador Susan Schwab today, October 6th: 
   Dear Ambassador Schwab: 
   We commend your work with the Canadian government to reach an agreement regarding Canadian softwood lumber imported into the United States. This agreement is the capstone of many years of hard negotiations, and we believe that your leadership was a critical factor in the agreement. 
   We understand that the original deadline of October 1, 2006 was extended because of pressure by Canadian industries to provide them the necessary time to comply with the new regulations. While we still fully support the agreement, it was our hope that the original deadline for the Canadian government to begin to collect taxes would be met. We feel those in Canada who do not want the agreement are finding ways to delay implementation. 
   With each day that passes, the U.S. market is flooded with Canadian lumber. As a result, U.S. mill owners are facing the difficult decision to remain open or not. For some, the decision will be temporary, for others it will be permanent. As you can imagine, we have heard from a number of mill operators expressing great concern that the Canadian lumber industry is unfairly exporting their products in an effort to get around the impending tax implementation set for November 1. 
   Immediate action is needed to address this unexpected crisis. For starters, the agreement must be implemented as quickly as possible, including termination of all pending court cases. Moreover, to discourage the continued surge of Canadian imports, the border tax measures contemplated by the agreement should be applied retroactively to October 1. 
   We appreciate your continued attention to this matter. The Canadian lumber settlement agreement provides a great opportunity to solve the types of unfair trade problems that have long afflicted U.S. sawmills and workers. We encourage you to aggressively pursue any opportunity to ensure the agreement is fully and expeditiously implemented.

SNOWE, DORGAN CALL ON MAJORITY LEADER TO ALLOW SENATE TO TAKE UP PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORT BILL
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) today released an October 6th letter sent to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist calling for open debate on allowing Americans to access lower priced imported prescription drugs. 
   In a July letter to Senator Frist, Senators Snowe and Dorgan, coauthors of S. 334, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, joined by Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John McCain (R-AZ) requested a vote on their legislation prior to the September recess. That letter was never answered nor acknowledged.  
   Today, Snowe and Dorgan put Frist on notice they intend to move the legislation to the Senate floor with or without him when the Senate returns in November. 
   ""We have waited for more than two years for the Senate to consider this issue,"" Dorgan and Snowe wrote in their letter to Frist. ""The needs of millions who rely on importation cannot continue to be postponed, so we will consider all means available to ensure that the full Senate finally considers this legislation when Congress reconvenes after the November election."" 
   ""The cost of inaction on this legislation is being felt by millions of Americans who are forced to pay higher costs for essential medication rather than a safe affordable alternative,"" Senator Snowe said. ""We have a responsibility to the American people to, at the very least, debate this issue on the floor of the Senate and consider legislation that could help the American people receive the prescription drugs they need. We have asked the Majority Leader to recognize the importance of this issue and give it the consideration it deserves, and quite frankly, the American people deserve."" 
   ""Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and they do so because the big drug companies have the ability to monopoly price their product,"" Senator Dorgan said. ""Allowing Americans access to lower priced prescription medicines from other countries would save billions, and would do so primarily by introducing a little price competition into the market place for prescription drugs."" 
   The Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act has 34 cosponsors and has garnered broad support from over 30 groups, including AARP and Families USA. The legislation would allow individuals to directly order medications from outside the U.S. when using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-registered and approved Canadian pharmacy. FDA would examine, register and inspect these facilities on a frequent basis. It would also allow U.S. licensed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved medications from a number of major industrialized nations and pass along the savings to their customers. The FDA would also ensure the highest standards for such essential functions as recording medical history, verifying prescriptions, and tracking shipments. 
   The following is the text of an October 6th letter sent to Majority Leader Frist by Senators Snowe and Dorgan: 
   Dear Majority Leader Frist: 
   We are disappointed that the Senate has failed to debate and vote on legislation to ensure Americans have access to more affordable, FDA-approved prescription drugs from Canada and other highly developed countries. We are writing to let you know that it is our intent to ensure that this issue is debated when the Senate reconvenes after the November election. 
   In July, we sent you a letter asking you to schedule time to debate the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act. This legislation, which we introduced with Senators Kennedy, Grassley, Stabenow and McCain, would ensure American consumers have access to more affordable, FDA-approved prescription drugs. Despite our previous discussions with you regarding this legislation, no response to our request has been received from your office. 
   When you met with us in May 2004, you acknowledged that the Senate must address this issue before adjourning in October 2004. Two years later, we are still waiting for the debate. We also understand that you stated your willingness to schedule floor time to consider standalone legislation on drug importation, should an amendment supporting drug importation achieve 60-vote support on the Senate floor. In July, we had that test vote. More than two-thirds of the Senate voted to give American consumers access to more affordable prescription drugs from Canada. 
   For too long, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, particularly the more than 46 million Americans who lack any form of drug coverage. While millions of Americans have been importing prescription drugs to obtain affordable therapy, the federal government has failed to place safeguards in place to protect consumers from rogue Internet pharmacies which have exploited the established safety of Canadian and other sources on which Americans have relied. It is now time to see that our legislation is considered by the full Senate so that a safe and effective system is in place to serve and protect American consumers. 
   We have waited for more than two years for the Senate to consider this issue. The needs of millions who rely on importation cannot continue to be postponed, so we will consider all means available to ensure that the full Senate may finally consider this legislation when Congress reconvenes after the November election. We hope you will join us to see that this critical legislation is considered.

  By Sen. Olympia J. Snowe
  This week, we mark the solemn third anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the crash of United Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. Americans will always remember the more than three thousand victims killed on that horrific morning, including the eight people with ties to Maine - Anna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline and Robert Norton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. We also honor those who selflessly risked their lives to help others, and those who have since dedicated their lives to rooting out the global network of terrorists and defending our nation. 
   As a nation, the pains of that day will never fade - withstanding even the tempering nature of time. Our nation and our spirit were attacked on September 11th by a stateless, faceless enemy. But, as a true testament to the unrelenting vigilance of Americans, we rose above the smoldering rubble of Ground Zero and the Pentagon as a nation united and resolved. And, three years later, that enemy is no longer faceless - and they are, now, rightly the ones under attack.
   As the President has accurately stated, our nation is entrenched in a global war on terror. American servicemen and women around the world are working in cooperation with our international allies in identifying and extracting the deep roots of terrorist groups. Our joint efforts have led to measurable successes - disruption of financial funding channels to terrorist groups, dismantling of weapons' trade routes of the black market, and the capture or killing of hundreds of known terrorists. 
   Our work is not nearly completed, and there will be more sacrifices placed upon the American people. However, we will, as we have in every challenge placed before us in our history, rise with courage and due diligence to the situation and accomplish the mission with resounding success. As we remember those who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks of September 11th, let us honor to those who have died in pursuit of justice for those responsible for the atrocities, and freedom for all. 
   While operations continue around the world to achieve greater international security, we cannot be complacent as the threat to our homeland remains. Without question, our domestic security has been significantly strengthened. Under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, airports are more secure with the addition of professional security screeners from the Transportation Security Administration. Ports and coastline are also safer because of the time and effort invested to strengthen the Coast Guard, which I oversee in my role as Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries and Coast Guard. And land borders with Canada and Mexico are more stringently patrolled through the cooperation of the Border and Protection Agency and the Citizenship & Immigration Services Agency. 
   Additionally, in cities and towns across Maine, our police and firefighters, our hospitals and health care workers, have received invaluable training and equipment through the allocation of federal preparedness grants - a process that continues today. 
   As we did not foresee the tragedies of September 11th, 2001, we cannot foretell what will happen next. But we can and must work together to remain vigilant against an adaptable and resilient enemy who care nothing about killing the innocent. We must also remember those who have come before us, maintain our collective strength in the face of continued threats, and remind each other of the principles and people in which we believe. By working together every day to help change the world, we are paying the highest possible honor to the more than three thousand people who lost their lives on September 11th, and to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the fight against terror in the days and years that have followed and those to come.
   It is the indomitable American spirit - fueled by freedom, polished with compassion and burnished by pride in our country and the men and women who are risking their lives to protect ours, that makes us great as a nation. It is our spirit that will allow us to never forget those lives lost - and our unfaltering spirit that honors our heros, at home and abroad, each day. Because, we will always remember.

COLLINS, SNOWE URGE INCREASED FUNDING FOR LIHEAP
  In expectation of a harsh winter season and record-high energy prices, Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe have petitioned the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) to transfer funding to the ""Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program"" (LIHEAP) prior to September 30, 2004, the end of the federal fiscal year.  
   ""We have long fought for increased funding for LIHEAP which provided critical assistance to 45,700 Maine households last winter alone. With application expectations for this year exceeding 60,000 homes and escalating energy prices, there is an urgent and substantial need for greater federal support of LIHEAP prior to the impending cold winter months,"" said the Senators in a joint statement. ""There is a limited window of opportunity to transfer the much-needed funding prior to the end of the fiscal year and the onset of the typically harsh Maine winter."" 
   This month, the lock-in price for heating oil in Maine is $1.61 per gallon - a $.23 increase from last January. Current predictions estimate the price per gallon to reach as high as $2.00, translating into a household home energy bill increase of nearly $400 for the 2004-2005 winter months. In a letter to HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, the Senators urged increased federal support for LIHEAP outlining these concerns. 
   ""For many low-income families, disabled individuals, and senior citizens living on fixed incomes, home energy costs are unaffordable. These families carry a higher energy burden than most Americans - spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills. States in the Northeast and Midwest, which we represent, face some of the nation's highest energy prices and cost-of-living expenses, placing additional financial burdens on low-income households. Unfortunately, LIHEAP reaches only 15 percent of the 30 million households eligible for assistance. The program needs at least $3 billion simply to equal the purchasing power it provided in 1982. Transferring funds to LIHEAP before the end of the fiscal year will provide critical resources to states to reduce the energy burdens of low-income households,"" the bipartisan letter spearheaded by Collins and Snowe read.

  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today pressed President Bush to include $600 million for the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in the Administration's emergency supplemental funding request to assist those impacted by Hurricanes Charley and Frances. This funding would help alleviate a looming, but preventable, crisis for millions of Americans due to the soaring cost of home heating fuel as winter approaches.  
   ""As the Administration works to compile a badly needed supplemental funding request to meet the emergency needs of the millions of Americans endangered by Hurricanes Charley and Frances, we urge you to also include $600 million in emergency Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds to avoid a looming, but preventable, crisis for millions of additional Americans caused by the soaring cost and diminishing affordability of home heating fuel as winter approaches,"" a letter by a bipartisan group of Senators, spearheaded by Snowe wrote. 
   LIHEAP provides a safety net against high energy costs for the nation's low-income households, disabled individuals and senior citizens living on fixed incomes. For many low-income families, disabled individuals and senior citizens living on fixed incomes, home energy costs are unaffordable. The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown since 1981, but the number of households served has declined, because of high fuel costs. 
   ""The current rise in energy prices coupled with energy debt remaining from last winter are leading to increased disconnections and arrears among consumers as the winter heating season begins - threatening the well-being of families and seniors. This situation warrants the provision of emergency LIHEAP funding in the supplemental request, as it may be our last opportunity to act before the winter cold sets in,"" the letter continued. 
   Americans are facing record prices for oil, natural gas and propane. Northeast and Midwest states need additional funding immediately to help low-income families and seniors restore disconnected utility service before the start of the winter heating season and to ensure affordable heat for their homes. In Maine, 45,700 applications were received for assistance last year, but the State expects at least 60,000 requests for this coming winter, so last year's assistance of $400 per household will be hard to meet as the costs of heating oil are predicted to go up to $2 per gallon for this coming winter. It is expected that more needy handicapped and elderly people will reach crises proportions just to keep warm. 
   ""When home energy bills are unaffordable in winter, low-income households rely on alternative heating sources such as ovens or space heaters. The National Fire Protection Association reports that house fires show a sharp increase in the cold-weather months. Half of the home heating fires and three-fourths of the home heating fires deaths occur in the winter months,"" the letter continued. 
   Residents in Northeast and Midwest states face some of the Nation's highest energy burdens and cost-of-living expenses, placing serious financial burdens on low-income households. The Energy Information Administration is forecasting that heating costs will again increase this winter: heating a home with natural gas will cost an average of $1,049 this winter; heating with oil will cost $1,094; and, heating with propane will cost $1,361. These predicted increases come on top of soaring energy prices over the past several years. Compared to average heating costs from 1998 to 2000, expenditures this winter are expected to be 55 percent higher for natural gas; 45 percent higher for heating oil; and 41 percent higher for propane. ""Families are facing an unforeseen energy emergency that requires an immediate response,"" the letter said. 
   ""Residents and business affected by the hurricanes deserve the nation's full support and financial assistance, and we stand ready and willing to do everything we can to help. At the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent so much needless hardship for millions of other Americans by acting to get these LIHEAP emergency funds before we have another full-blown crisis on our hands,"" the letter concluded.

  A long-time supporter of conservation efforts, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was pleased that a total of $3,214,200 in conservation fund was awarded to Maine under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), and for the Lake Umbagog and Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuges preservation projects in Maine.  
   Snowe's senior environmental policy advisor has represented the State of Maine for many years at meetings of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, chaired by Interior Secretary Gale Norton, to ensure the conservation projects that protect the habitats of local bird species, were funded. 
   ""I am pleased that these vital conservation projects in Maine are being recognized by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for their work to preserve the habitats of native bird populations. Maine has a long-standing tradition of establishing model private-public partnerships to protect future generations of native species within our pristine wetlands and forestlands,"" said Snowe. 
   At this week's Commission meeting, Snowe's senior policy advisor Ginny Worrest - representing the Commissioner of Maine's Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife - conveyed the historical commitment of the Senator and Maine to conservation projects in the state, pressing for funding to acquire additional acres of land. 
   The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission voted to fund the following preservation projects in Maine: 
   * $1,000,000 for the Downeast Lakes Forestry Partnership under the North American Wetlands Conservation Trust (NAWCA). The Partnership is working to conserve a total of 339,000 acres of working forestland, protecting the habitats of native bird species, including the northern pintail, ring-necked ducks, Canadian goose, and the red-winged blackbird. Additionally, eagles, bobcats, lynx, deer, moose, and rare species of freshwater clams and dragonflies will be protected. 
   * $1,000,000 for the Maine Forest Ecosystem Project under NAWCA, including both the West Branch Easement and the Katahdin Forest Easement. The collaboration of the Forest Society of Maine, the Nature Conservancy, the Maine Department of Conservation and other entities seek to add to its 476,291 acres currently protected - of which 50,415 acres are wetlands. The greater ecosystem project includes the protection of migrant songbird habitats for the Olive-sided Flycatcher and the Canada Warbler, along with multiple populations of the Wood Turtle. 
   * $650,000 for the Greater Pleasant Bay Project under NAWCA. Developed by the Maine Wetlands Protection Coalition - a partnership of federal, state and local agencies with statewide conservation organizations, local land trusts and private landowners - to permanently protect 762 acres of wetland to preserve the habitat values for water-dependent black ducks and migratory shorebirds. Additionally, the wetlands provide nesting islands for bald eagles and seabirds, including some species native only to Maine. 
   * $538,200 to add 466 acres to the Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge in Oxford County. The Refuge, which spans over the Maine-New Hampshire border, has long been recognized as one of the most productive breeding areas in the northeastern U.S., particularly for the common loon and the osprey. Large populations of moose and black bears also make the habitats in the area. The funding will support efforts to comprehensively manage residential development projects and increased recreational activities of power-boating and water-skiing from further disrupting native nesting and breeding habitats. 
   * $26,000 to add land to the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge spanning York and Cumberland Counties. Intended for the purchase of 36.6 acres from the Kittery Land Trust, the acquisition is considered critical to protecting breeding habitats, including a nearly all salt marsh, for migrating waterfowl, specifically black ducks, mallards and wood ducks. The preserving of the salt marsh and neighboring dune grass along with several other natural communities form a coastal dune-salt marsh ecosystem in southern Maine.

  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is pleased that the Senate passed by voice vote this morning an amendment that she cosponsored with Senator George Voinovich (R-OH) to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill to provide additional funds for Emergency Management Performance Grants (EMPG) program. A 2003 survey by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA) found that the EMPG program faces a $245 million shortfall. This amendment would begin to make up that shortfall by adding $56 million to this year's FY 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which is currently being considered by the full Senate.  
   ""I'm pleased that the Senate passed this amendment to provide critical additional funds for the Emergency Management Performance Grant program,"" said Snowe. ""This program has been vital in supporting the efforts of state and local agencies against not only terrorist threats in a post-September 11th world, but against natural emergencies like blizzards, floods and hurricanes. With the passage of this amendment, the Senate has taken a substantive step to meet the needs of state and local governments across the country."" 
   Congress provided $180 million to EMPG in FY 2004 - a $15 million increase over FY 2003. The Administration's budget request would fund the program at only $170 million and proposed to restrict the use of the grants to no more than 25 percent for personnel and calls for an increased focus on terrorism. NEMA estimated that approximately 60 percent of state and local emergency management positions could have been impacted by the restriction on the use of the grants for personnel. 
   The EMPG program was created to assist in developing emergency response systems at the state and local government level that can handle disasters and emergencies of all types and sizes. It provides the only source of federal assistance to state and local managers to help with their emergency management capabilities. The program gives needed emergency coordination and planning support to state and local governments and first responders, effectively integrating federal response assets and resources when needed.

SNOWE URGES FAA, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS TO COME BACK TO NEGOTIATING TABLE
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) to come to a mutual agreement on a pending contract. Sen. Snowe is a member of the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees the FAA.  
   ""I believe that the FAA moved too quickly in declaring an impasse in the ongoing negotiations with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and sending the matter to Congress. An impasse is not in the best interest of either party - politicizing the negotiations and putting the question of a reasonable settlement at risk. I believe they should instead come back to the negotiating table to find an equitable resolution,"" said Snowe. 
   Last week, the FAA declared that the negotiations had reached an ""impasse"", sending the contract to the United States Congress to resolve. Even though the negotiations have been sent to Congress, the FAA and NATCA can still negotiate. The contract mediation expired on March 31st. 
   Snowe sent a letter to Marion Blakey, the FAA Administrator, urging them to continue their negotiations beyond March 31rst in order to come to a voluntary agreement. 
   The Honorable Marion Blakey 
   Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration 
   800 Independence Avenue, SW 
   Washington, D.C. 20591 
   Dear Administrator Blakey, 
   I am aware that the contract mediation between the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) expires March 31st. If your intent is to move to impasse and present the FAA's proposal to Congress, then I urge you to continue your negotiations beyond that date in order to come to a voluntary agreement. I believe that a negotiated settlement is truly in the best interest of all parties. 
   The impasse process that follows an unsuccessful mediation attempt has still not been tested by the courts. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has not made a ruling providing guidance to the parties on how to proceed during an impasse situation. The Court ruled that each organization's arguments were equally compelling, but that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The case has been remanded to the Fair Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) for a decision. I feel that a decision must be rendered by the FLRA before any impasse proceeding should be considered. 
   Considering the uncertainty of the situation and the possible illegalities, I am hopeful you will remain at the negotiating table with the union. If negotiation fails, I ask you to proceed in a reasonable manner consistent with good labor relations principles. Alternatively, I encourage you to consider leaving the current agreement intact until all of the surrounding legal issues are resolved. 
   Sincerely, 
   OLYMPIA J. SNOWE 
   U.S. Senator.

SNOWE CALLS ON CONGRESS TO CLOSE TECHNOLOGICAL GAP IN EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICES OFFERED BY VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL PROVIDERS
  At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on ""Voice Over Internet Protocol and the Future of 9-1-1 Services,"" Senior Member Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) on Wednesday, April 11, urged Congress to actively usher in the next-generation of 9-1-1 services. Earlier this year, Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) introduced the ""IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2007,"" which would require Voice Over Internet Protocol providers to connect directly to emergency services when 9-1-1 was dialed and provide the 9-1-1 call center with the caller's number and location information.  
   ""While consumer technology is advancing, public safety's technology remains stagnant at the high cost of human lives,"" said Senator Snowe. ""It is utterly unacceptable that a consumer who chooses to subscribe to a VoIP phone service would be unable to reach a 9-1-1 operator during times of emergency. I strongly urge Congress to support this vital legislation that would ensure 9-1-1 and E9-1-1 services can effectively do their jobs and help save American lives."" 
   The Snowe-Nelson legislation would ensure that those who control the essential 9-1-1 equipment allow VoIP providers to fully interconnect into the 9-1-1 system and would provide public safety officials and VoIP providers parity with wireless and wireline services in terms of protection from frivolous lawsuits. The legislation would also preserve the major funding source for 9-1-1 call centers, state 9-1-1 fees and also directs the E9-1-1 Implementation and Coordination Office to develop a national plan for migrating to a next-generation, IP-enabled emergency network.

  As friendly neighbors, Maine and Canada have a long-standing history of successfully overcoming energy, environmental, and tourism issues together. This connection to Canada has only grown stronger in recent years as health care costs in the United States have sky-rocketed. While Americans pay the world's highest prices for prescription drugs - currently spending over $200 billion each year - our Canadian neighbors have access to their medications at a far lower cost. 
   In fact, thousands of Mainers have found they can only obtain safe and affordable medications through a Canadian pharmacy. If we can import food safely, then there is no doubt that importing prescription drugs from Canada can be done in an equally safe manner. I believe that drug importation has the potential to promote sorely-needed competition in an industry in the United States that has experienced little. That is why I have fought to enact legislation to legalize and regulate drug importation through a safe and effective regime to protect Americans.  
   I have introduced the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act over two years ago with my colleague Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and since then, we have garnered significant support for our efforts with one third of the Senate joining us in cosponsoring our legislation. We have built a powerful, bipartisan coalition behind our bill, including Senators Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and John McCain (R-AZ) and have the support of over 30 outside groups, including AARP and Families USA. And just last month, two-thirds of the Senate voted to stop U.S. Customs from preventing consumers from importing prescription drugs from Canada. Clearly the will of the Congress is there to get this done and I have urged Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) to take up this legislation as soon as possible. 
   Healthcare costs pose a financial problem to most Americans, and drug importation is a realistic solution. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated our legislation will save $50 billion - and that is simply the direct savings. As we see greater competition develop, the savings could increase substantially. 
   The Senate has passed drug importation legislation in the past, but each time a ""safety certification"" requirement has prevented its implementation. Critics of drug importation argue that imported medications would not meet our safety standards. In most cases, those imported medications are the exact same as those sold in the U.S., made in the same manufacturing plants, and inspected by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). Wherever a consumer buys their prescription drugs, the FDA will ensure the safety of these medications by continuing to examine, register, and approve the safety of imported drugs. We have also included provisions that will prevent counterfeiting, track the handling of drugs, and improve medication labeling. I believe our drug importation system will actually raise the bar for our standard of drug safety, exceeding our current domestic standards. 
   Opponents claim importation will cause harm, but they fail to note the greatest prescription drug threat to Americans is the inability to pay for medication that will save lives. In Maine, one of our own physicians has reported hospitalizing two patients in a single month because they could no longer afford their prescriptions. The cost is clearly not just in dollars, but in lives. 
   We can no longer sit back and watch Americans bear this cost. Other countries have successfully relied on drug importation to manage health care costs for decades. The FDA has been unable to report a single individual harmed by Canadian drugs, and in Europe, in thirty years of drug importation no death or injury has ever been documented. I believe that we as a nation are certainly up to the task of managing a similar system. 
   Over 40 million Americans currently bear the burden of paying exorbitant prices for their prescription drugs - or going without. Our government can no longer stand by while Americans are forced to forgo life's necessities - like paying for food or energy bills - to pay for life-saving medicines. We must utilize the knowledge, research, and tools we have to improve the health of millions and reduce our escalating health care costs. Drug importation is one such tool and it simply must be used.

SNOWE: CONGRESS PASSES CRITICAL FISHERIES LEGISLATION
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Senate Fisheries and the Coast Guard Subcommittee Chair, hailed final congressional passage late last night of the Magnuson-Stevens Act Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (MSA) of 2006 (H.R. 5946) and called the consensus, bipartisan bill a significant step toward providing stability and security for Maine and the nation's fish and fishing communities. The legislation now awaits the President's signature to become law. Sen. Olympia Snowe worked in the last days of the 109th Congress for passage of this legislation critical to the state of Maine. 
 ""Whether we are talking about a 300 year-old fishing village in Downeast Maine, or remote fishing outposts in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, we must be bound by a commitment to a thoughtful balance between sustaining both fish and fishermen,"" Snowe said. ""The Magnuson-Stevens Act strikes that thoughtful balance and is essential to the economies and marine environments of coastal communities in Maine and throughout the nation. I am especially proud that in the final days of the 109th Congress we were able to reach a bipartisan consensus to pass legislation that benefits Maine and the nation.""  
 The bipartisan bill, which reauthorizes the MSA from Fiscal Year 2007 through Fiscal Year 2013, will for the first time prohibit overfishing in future fisheries management plans. It also contains provisions that would help improve international fishery management and conservation compliance with an emphasis on strengthening controls on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. The MSA reauthorization bill retains key provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) that was passed in 1996, while making adjustments to the legislation designed to improve national compliance with the Act. 
 MSA, originally enacted in 1976, was most recently amended through the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) of 1996, and establishes a national framework for conserving and managing marine fisheries within a 200-mile wide zone contiguous to the United States through eight Regional Fishery Management Councils. 
 ""With this legislation, we have established a common framework that achieves the goals of sustaining fish and the fishing industry while still providing our Regional Councils with the flexibility and tools they need to address their unique local challenges,"" said Snowe. ""Our fisheries law must accommodate scientific uncertainty, recognize that fisheries ecosystems are highly complex, and ensure that our management system can adapt to ever-changing marine environments. This legislation is not a perfect solution, but I believe we have struck an appropriate balance between preserving the marine resources of our coastal communities with these fisheries management tools.""
 Snowe successfully added several provisions to the bill that are critical to Maine and New England in the legislation: 
 * Provisions that ensure that, at the end of any quota development process in New England, two-thirds of eligible fishermen would be required to approve the plan before it could be implemented. 
 * The bill directs fisheries managers to utilize economic and social data and assessment methods based on the best information available, analyze the cumulative impacts of management measures, and explore possible mitigation measures for minimizing the impacts of management plans, all of which are critical for ensuring management accountability to fishing communities. 
 * Language directing managers to consider steaming time, or the time it takes fishermen from different states to transit to distant fishing grounds, in their management plans, so that fishermen may not lose their fishing days-at-sea. 
 * In addition, this legislation contains language requiring the Secretary of Commerce to complete a comprehensive study of the economic and social impacts of regulations contained in Framework 42, the updates to Amendment 13. These rules, implemented in November 2006, require additional cuts in groundfishing effort in New England, and this study will ensure that the full range of impacts and mitigation measures are identified and addressed by regulators. 
 * Provisions requiring the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to make clearer rules for streamlining the criteria and approval of Experimental Fishing Permits (EFPs), or special permits to allow fishermen to test new gears or methods not otherwise allowed under fishing rules. New England groundfishermen have been applying for EFPs for several years; however, NMFS has been unable to approve most of these requests under their current management system, because of procedural and administrative technicalities. 
 * The bill authorizes a cooperative research study of herring in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem to help answer questions about stock size and distribution, which are necessary to effectively manage herring and other fisheries that depend upon herring. 
 * The legislation addresses stressed groundfish stocks, like cod. Right now, certain state-licensed fishermen in New England are harvesting cod, one of the most depleted species in the federally-managed groundfish complex. Language contained in this legislation would require NMFS to determine if state fishing is inconsistent with Amendment 13, and if so, to take action to correct it. 
 * Another provision allows for a waiver of the U.S. processing requirement for fisheries that can show historic practice of processing in other countries that have comparable food safety standards, which would allow Maine herring fishermen to continue using Canadian processors. To help new domestic processors get off the ground in places like Maine where a processing void exists for some fisheries, Snowe included a provision that directs the Secretary of Commerce to work with the Small Business Administration and other federal assistance agencies to facilitate U.S. investment in processing. 
 Other highlights of the underlying bill include: 
 Preserves and Strengthens the Regional Fishery Management Councils 
 * Establishes a Council training program open to existing Council members and required for new members designed to prepare them for complying with legal, scientific, economic, and conflict of interest requirements applicable to the fishery management process. 
 * Strengthens and clarifies the MSA's conflict of interest and recusal requirements. 
 * Ensures that Council members disclose any financial arrangements with any other individuals who may have a financial interest in activity over which the Council has jurisdiction, as well as disclose any other sources of compensation the Council member may receive. 
 Mandates the Use of Allowable Catch Levels to Prevent Overfishing and Preserve Sustainable Harvest 
 * Mandates that every fishery management plan contain an annual catch limit that prevents overfishing in the fishery. 
 * Directs the Councils to set annual catch limits that are not to exceed the recommendations of the Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSCs) or other appropriate scientific body. 
 * Requires the Councils to include measures in a fishery management plan that ensure accountability with catch limits. 
 Establishes National Guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs 
 * Establishes national guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) for the harvesting of fish. The LAPPs include Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs), and are expanded to allow for allocation of harvesting privileges to fishing communities or regional fishery associations. 
 * Does not provide for the establishment of a separate Processor Quota, but processors would be eligible to hold LAPPs to harvest fish, pursuant to current law, and any decision to allocate privileges to processors would be made in the Council's normal allocation decision making process. 
 * Provides for a seven-year administrative review of each program's compliance with the goals of the program and the MSA. 
 Improves the Uniformity of Decision Making for Fishery Management Plans and Aligns them with the NEPA Process 
 * Authorizes the establishment of a Coordinating Committee comprised of Council Chairs, Vice Chairs, and Executive Directors as a forum to discuss issues relevant to all Councils. 
 * Directs the Secretary, with public participation and in consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Regional Fishery Management Council, to develop one, uniform fishery management-specific environmental review process that conforms National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, analysis, and public input schedules to the timelines appropriate for fishery management decisions under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The intent is to establish one consistent, timely, and predictable regulatory process for fishery management decisions. 
 Improves Data Collection for Better Management 
 * Authorizes a national cooperative research and management program, which would be implemented on a regional basis to be developed and conducted through partnerships between federal and state managers, commercial and recreational fishing industry participants, and scientists. 
 * Priority support would be given for efforts to improve stock assessments, assess bycatch, identify or conserve habitat areas, and collect socioeconomic data. 
 * Provides a mechanism for improving data relating to recreational fisheries by establishing a new national program for the registration of marine recreational fishermen who fish in federal waters or for anadromous species. 
 * Establishes a program dedicated to the development of technologies and methods to improve the ability of fishery participants to reduce bycatch and associated mortality. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Councils and other interests, to create a regionally based Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program to develop technological devices and engineering techniques for minimizing bycatch, bycatch mortality, and post-release mortality. The provision includes an outreach mandate to encourage the adoption of new technologies, and also encourages the adoption of bycatch reduction incentives in fishery management plans, such as bycatch quotas. 
 The bill strengthens the role of science in Council decision making through a number of provisions. 
 * Specifies that the role of the Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSCs) is to provide their Councils with ongoing scientific advice needed for management decisions, including acceptable biological catch or optimum yield, annual catch limits, or other mortality limits. 
 * The SSCs are expected to advise the Councils on a variety of other issues, including stock status and health, bycatch, habitat status, and socio-economic impacts. 
 * Requires that SSC appointees be federal, state, academic, or independent experts with strong scientific or technical credentials and experience and authorizes stipends for non-government SSC members. 
 Strengthens U.S. Leadership in International Conservation and Management 
 * IUU fishing, as well as expanding fleets and high bycatch levels, are threats to sustainable fisheries worldwide. The bill includes provisions to strengthen the ability of international fishery management organizations and the United States to ensure appropriate enforcement and compliance with conservation and management measures in high seas fisheries. 
 * Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to establish an international compliance and monitoring program provide reports to Congress on progress in reducing IUU fishing, promoting international cooperation, and strengthening the ability of regional fishery management organizations to combat IUU and other harmful fishing practices. 
 * Requires the Secretary of Commerce to define IUU, but specifies that the definition must include violations of quotas or other rules established under a regional or international agreement, as well as overfishing or use of certain damaging gear in high seas areas with no international or regional conservation and management measures. 
 * Allows for the use of measures authorized under the High Seas Driftnet Act to force compliance in cases where regional or international fishery management organizations are unable to stop IUU fishing or excessive bycatch. 
 Reauthorizes and Strengthens Two International Fishery Treaties 
 Contains implementing legislation for (1) the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention, a treaty to establish the first regional management regime for highly migratory species in the Central and Western Pacific, and (2) the Pacific Whiting Treaty, to establish an international and scientific and management regime for Pacific whiting, which are before the Senate for advice and consent. 
 International fisheries stewardship: 
 Snowe added language governing international fisheries directing the Secretary of Commerce to designate a new, Senate-confirmed, senior position within National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to perform the duties of the Secretary with respect to international fisheries agreements, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the International Whaling Commission. This provision will improve consistency and continuity in the administration and leadership of U.S. activities in these international conservation fora. 
 Funding 
 The bill authorizes $ 338 million in FY2007 for implementation of activities under the MSA, which would increase annually to $397 million in 2013. To address the growing need for additional funding for fisheries technology, science, and related information, the bill includes a new provision that would establish a new Fisheries Conservation and Management Fund. This Fund is intended to respond to the call by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for dedicated funding for ocean-related needs, but establishes a fishery management-specific fund, patterned on the Wallop-Breaux Trust Fund ""user pays, user benefits"" model. 
 Allocations from the fund would be determined in consultation with the Councils, and would be for specific activities not funded under current law, including technology upgrades, cooperative research, gear buybacks and development, and sustainable seafood marketing and handling activities. Funds to be deposited in the fund would include: funds from certain penalties and seizures; any quota set-asides designated by a Council; general revenues; or donated funds.

SNOWE SUCCESSFULLY SECURES CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION GIVING FAMILIES RELIEF IN CARING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES
Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) successfully secured congressional passage of legislation, the Lifespan Respite Care Act (S.1283), providing relief to family caregivers that gives them the flexibility, the tools and the resources to care for a chronically-ill family member. Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) took the Senate floor today pressing for passage of their legislation, which now awaits the President's signature to become law.
 ""The challenge of how we will look after our loved ones when they are too frail to take care of themselves can be overwhelming. When families are suddenly confronted with making these difficult choices, they often have no idea where to find information on what services or facilities exist in the community that best fit their needs or who they can turn to for advice,"" said Snowe.  
 ""Now more than ever, the family caregiver fills a key role in our country's health system by providing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For many, care in the home results in a higher quality of life and can also result in substantial cost savings. Yet despite these benefits, the supports for such care are far too limited,"" continued Snowe. ""Today the Congress responded by passing the Lifespan Respite Care Act before the we adjourn for the year, because it is so critical to those Americans who are caring for their family members. They need and deserve our support with this bill.""
 Each year, 50 million American families provide in-home care to family members with disabilities and chronic conditions. In-home care is often preferred by family members over institutionalized settings. But the stress - from emotional to financial - for the family caregivers can be enormous. In addition to providing a brief respite for often physically and emotionally drained family caregivers, respite care also can delay forcing a patient into an institutionalized and more costly setting like a nursing home. 
 According to recent studies, family caregivers suffer poor health and even higher morality rates. For example, mortality rates among older caregivers are 63 percent higher than among non-caregivers. As much as 66 percent of caregivers report physical or mental health problems due to care-giving. And nearly half have a chronic health condition that requires ongoing medical care.
 ""To ease the burden this responsibility places on caregivers and their families, it is critical that they have access to better information on respite care services and more qualified respite care providers. Because while caregivers are heroes in every sense of the word, they are also human beings who are often asked to perform superhuman feats. Today, the average American woman can expect to spend 17 years caring for a child and 18 years caring for an elderly parent,"" said Snowe. 
 The legislation specifically expands and enhances respite services, improves coordination and access for respite care, helps recruit and train respite-care providers, and helps family caregivers find and pay for respite services. Specifically, the bill would authorize competitive grants to states to make quality respite care available and accessible to family caregivers, regardless of age, disability or family situation.
 ""This legislation is about enhancing people's understanding of their options and their ability to access those options. To accomplish this, our bill creates a flexible grant program to states that will help communities improve the availability of respite care services to support family caregivers. Funding from the new grant program will also increase the availability of appropriately trained respite care providers and volunteers,"" said Snowe.
 Our nation lacks a national coordinated approach to helping those who need respite care find it, qualify for it and pay for it. Respite care is in short supply or inaccessible for all age groups. Disparate and inadequate funding streams exist for respite in most states. Respite care services capped and limited to narrow eligibility categories. Long waiting lists are the norm. Respite care may not exist at all in some states for children over age 18 with disabilities who are still living at home, or individuals under age 60 with conditions such as ALS, MS, spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries, or children with autism or serious emotional conditions.
 The Lifespan Respite Care Act would provide grants to an agency or organization to: 
 * Develop lifespan respite care at the state and local level
 * Provide respite care services for family caregivers caring for children or adults 
 * Train and recruit respite care workers and volunteers 
 * Provide information to caregivers about available respite or support services
 * Assist caregivers in gaining access to such services 
 Respite care improves the health and well-being of caregivers, reduces the risk of abuse or neglect (children with disabilities are four times more likely to be abused or neglected; 32 out of 1000 elders are victims of abuse - 90 percent of the perpetrators were family members), helps delay or avoid more costly hospitalizations, nursing home placements, foster care or other out-of-home placements. 
 There are an estimated 29 million family caregivers who provide $306 billion in free care every year to their loved ones. If caregivers had to stop providing this care, the cost to government in out-of-home placements would be astronomical.
 The Federal government would benefit directly from Respite Saving: Benefits cited above all result in cost-savings. If respite delays institutionalization of a person with Alzheimer's by as little as a month, $1.12 billion is saved annually. By avoiding or just delaying out-of-home placements, millions in Medicaid long-term care savings alone could potentially be realized. 
 Over 70 national and 100 state and local organizations have endorsed the bill. The legislation has 27 Senate cosponsors. In 2002, Snowe joined with Senator Clinton in introducing the Lifespan Respite Care Act. 
 Snowe has long championed efforts for family caregivers including her legislation in 1986 that established the first National Family Caregivers Week, and since then she has introduced legislation to improve tax treatment of dependent care expenses, and offer tax deductions for health care, adult day care, and respite care costs for those caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease.

Late last night, the United States Senate passed tax legislation that is vital to America's working families. If the Congress had not acted in the final hours of this legislative session, these tax provisions would have expired at great expense to American tax payers. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, the committee that has jurisdiction over the nation's tax policy, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) pressed to have the New Markets Tax Credit, the $4,000 college tuition deduction and several energy conservation tax incentives included in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. 
 ""In the closing hours of the 109th Congress, we passed a massive tax bill that includes several essential provisions for hard-working Americans. It is unfortunate it took this long to extend these critical tax provisions when we could have passed them this summer,"" said Snowe. ""Yet, this bill includes several provisions that I have long championed that are important for Maine and America, including extending the $4,000 tuition deduction, the New Markets Tax Credit to help rural areas, and energy efficiency tax credits to lessen our reliance of foreign imported oil.""  
 Below is a list of those tax provisions that Snowe authored that were set to expire: 
 * Snowe joined Senate Finance Committee colleague, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), in pushing to ensure that the above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses to allow families help defray the cost of college tuition was included in the bill. 2.7 million taxpayers in Maine and the country benefited from the $4,000 deduction in 2004. 
 * Snowe introduced the extension of new markets tax credit and modification for rural counties. The new markets tax credit's innovative approach uses the tax code to encourage long-term capital investments in downtrodden communities identified by the census as historically plagued by high unemployment, low levels of private investment and stifling poverty rates. In Maine, the NMTC has helped bring much needed investment dollars to struggling rural communities. The Credit, for example, enabled two pulp and paper mills owned by the Great Northern Paper Company in the Katahdin Forest area to stay in business and modernize, resulting in the direct employment of 650 people. 
 * Snowe also secured the extension of three energy efficiency provisions that she authored through 2008 that were set to expire at the end of 2007. An extension of deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings, a credit for new energy efficient homes and a credit for residential energy efficient property. These provisions were a part of the EFFECTER Act that Snowe authored with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that were included in the 2005 Energy bill. 
 Snowe also supported the following provisions: 
 * Extension of the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit and expansion to enhance alternative methods of determining the credit. 
 * Extension and expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for hiring individuals who face barriers to employment - and combination of the credit with the Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit in 2007. 
 * Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit for hiring individuals who have received public assistance for an extended period of time - and combination with the WOTC in 2007. 
 * Treating combat pay as earned income for purposes of the earned income credit calculation. 
 * Above-the-line deduction for out-of-pocket teacher classroom expenses. 
 * Expensing of brownfields remediation costs. In addition to the extension, the definition of a contaminated site is expanded to include sites contaminated by petroleum products.

SNOWE JOINS SENS. MCCAIN, LIEBERMAN IN REINTRODUCING ESSENTIAL CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, FEB. 11
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a strong advocate for confronting the impact of global climate change, participated in a press conference today with Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Joe Lieberman in reintroducing the Climate Stewardship Act (CSA). 
   ""We are here today reintroducing this legislation because reducing domestic, manmade greenhouse gas emissions is integral to addressing the environmental impacts of climate change and to give US businesses the kind of certainty they need to be able to make both sound and sensible decisions for the future in the international marketplace,"" said Snowe. ""I come to this legislation once again because ongoing scientific peer-reviewed research demonstrates this is one of the most significant environmental issues of the 21st century. Yet, I have grave concerns that the federal government, like the saying applied to Rome, is literally fiddling as the planet burns, or, at the very least, heats up.""  
   The Climate Stewardship Act sets up a cap and trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and is one of the ten recommendations of the International Climate Change Taskforce (ICCT) that Snowe co-chairs with the Rt. Honorable Stephen Byers of the United Kingdom. 
   ""I have insisted that in the ICCT report that one of the recommendations should be for countries to establish national cap-and-trade systems to reduce manmade carbon dioxide emissions. And that is precisely what the McCain-Lieberman legislation proposes to do,"" continued Snowe. 
   The goal of ICCT is to chart a new way forward on climate change - and outside of the Kyoto Protocol since both the US and Australia have said they will not ratify the treaty. In January the Task Force released its report with recommendations on how to move forward to address Climate Change. 
   ""Even with the Kyoto Protocol going into effect next week, it is obvious that new ideas for securing international cooperation are necessary as we cannot get to the heart of this global problem without the world's major economies at the table,"" continued Snowe. ""Domestically, we should encourage a market-based system where we put a monetary value on reducing this carbon - by giving industries credits for reducing emissions they can then trade in the market for those who need credits to meet their emissions obligations. This is a sensible, effective incentive. The CSA also allows the forestry industry - critical to my State of Maine - to voluntarily enter this program and receive credits for sequestering carbon through the trees they plant and grow in a sustainable manner."" 
   Included in the CSA is the call for a National Academies report to Congress on the potential negative effects that entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol will have on U.S. industry and its ability to compete globally. ""Since the Kyoto Protocol goes into effect next Wednesday, February 16th, we need to know - will U.S. businesses be able to compete in the global marketplace as our allies join forces under Kyoto to participate among themselves?"" said Snowe. 
   Finally, the CSA requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to carry out scientific research on abrupt climate change, a change in climate so rapid or unexpected that human or natural systems may have difficulty adapting to it. Last week, Snowe cosponsored legislation authorizing $60 million to be appropriated for a network of scientific research on abrupt climate change. 
   ""The bottom line is, for our country to do its part for the global environment, the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 sets out to help reduce our nation's emissions in an environmentally and economically friendly way. We have a choice - continue down a path of greater environmental damage and economic harm, or chart a course for a better future for our planet, and enhanced competitiveness for our industries. Let's ""do the right thing"" and pass this legislation,"" concluded Snowe. 
   Senator Snowe, a long-time advocate for continued scientific research into the harmful effects of global climate change, accepted an invitation last March to join the International Task Force on Climate Change. Formed by three global think tanks - the Center for American Progress (Washington, DC), the Institute for Public Policy Research (London), and the Australia Institute in Canberra, the Taskforce is a collection of eminent scientists, policymakers, and political leaders from around the world who have made recommendations for global strategies for reducing greenhouse emissions and provide long-term direction to address the international issue of climate change - most notably for UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for the upcoming July G8 meeting. 
   Key recommendations of the Taskforce include: 
   1. The G8 and other major economies, including from the developing world, form a G8+ Climate Group, to pursue technology agreements and related initiatives that will lead to large emissions reductions. 
   2. The G8-Plus Climate Group agree to shift their agricultural subsidies from food crops to biofuels, especially those derived from cellulosic materials, while implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure sustainable farming methods are encouraged, culturally and ecologically sensitive land preserved, and biodiversity protected. 
   3. G8 governments establish national renewable portfolio standards to generate at least 25% of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025, with higher targets needed for some G8 governments. 
   4. G8 governments increase their spending on research, development, and demonstration of advanced technologies for energy- efficiency and low- and zero-carbon energy supply by two-fold or more by 2010, at the same time as adopting strategies for the large-scale deployment of existing low- and zero-carbon technologies. 
   5. All industrialised countries introduce national mandatory cap-and-trade systems for carbon emissions, and construct them to allow for their future integration into a single global market. 
   6. A global framework be adopted that builds on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, and enables all countries to be part of concerted action on climate change at the global level in the post-2012 period, on the basis of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. 
   7. A long-term objective be established of preventing global average temperature from rising more than 2 C (3.6 F) above the pre-industrial level, to limit the extent and magnitude of climate-change impacts. 
   8. Governments remove barriers to and increase investment in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies and practices by taking steps including the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and requiring Export Credit Agencies and Multilateral Development Banks to adopt minimum efficiency or carbon intensity standards for projects they support. 
   9. Developed countries honour existing commitments to provide greater financial and technical assistance to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change, including the commitments made at the seventh conference of the parties to the UNFCCC in 2001, and pursue the establishment of an international compensation fund to support disaster mitigation and preparedness. 
   10. Governments committed to action on climate change raise public awareness of the problem and build public support for climate policies by pledging to provide substantial long-term investment in effective climate communication activities. 
   All of the Taskforce's recommendations are designed to build on the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol to help ensure that climate change is addressed effectively over the long term. 
   The following is a bill summary of the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005: 
   The Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 would require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation, transportation, industrial, and commercial economic sectors as defined by EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. The affected sectors represent approximately 85 percent of the overall U.S. emissions for the year 2000. The bill also would provide for the trading of emission allowances and reductions through the government-provided greenhouse gas database, which would contain an inventory of emissions and a registry of reductions. 
   TARGETS The bill would establish a target for the year 2010. The 2010 target would set the U.S. emissions level for the affected sectors at 5896 million metric tons (or the year 2000 levels) measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents. The quantity of emissions (number of tons) would be specified, as opposed to specifying the year, and is based upon the EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouses Gas Emissions and Sinks, which is submitted annually to the United Nations as part of the U.S.'s commitment under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The methodologies used are consistent with other international practices for measuring a country's greenhouses gas emissions. The bill's emission limits would not apply to the agricultural or residential sectors. Certain areas within the affected sectors may be exempt if the Administrator determines that it is not feasible to measure emissions from that area. These limits would be subject to a bi-annual review for adequacy by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. 
   ALLOWANCES All covered entities, those which have at least one facility that emits more than 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents per year, would be required to submit to the EPA one tradable allowance for each metric ton of greenhouse gases emitted during the reporting period. For the transportation sector, each petroleum refiner or importer would be required to submit an allowance for each unit of petroleum product sold that will produce a metric ton of emissions. The Administrator will determine the amount of emissions that will be emitted when a unit of petroleum products is used. 
   The Secretary of Commerce would be required to determine the amount of allowances to be given away free and the amount to be reserved for the public and report to the appropriate Congressional Committees. The Secretary's determination would be subject to a number of allocation factors identified in the bill. The publicly reserved allowances would be sold by a newly established Climate Change Credit Corporation. Proceeds from the sale of these allowances would be used to reduce consumers' energy costs, assist disproportionately affected workers, help low income communities, and disseminate technological solutions to climate change. 
   Alternatively, an entity may satisfy up to 15 percent of its emission allowance requirements by submitting tradable allowances from another nation's market in greenhouse gases, submitting a registered net increase in sequestration, or submitting emission reductions that was registered by a person that is not a covered entity. If a covered entity has an excess of tradable allowances for a reporting period, the entity may hold those allowances in order to sell, exchange, or use in the future. 
   The Administrator would be required to establish a loan program by which a covered entity may borrow against anticipated future reductions to meet current year emissions requirements. The loan would be attributable to either capital investments or new technology deployment. Interest rates would be at 10 percent annually for up to 5 years. 
   PENALTY Any company not meeting its emission limits would be fined for each ton of greenhouse gases over the limit at the rate of three times the market value of a ton of greenhouse gases. The market value would be based upon the price of emission credits from trading system provided for in the bill. 
   TRADING The trading aspects of the bill would be accomplished by incorporating the registry system as part of a database to collect, verify, and analyze emission information. It would allow companies that realized a verifiable emission reduction to register that reduction in the registry and subsequently trade them on the open market. Companies not regulated under the mandatory limits would be permitted to participate in the trading system. By participating, they would be required to report their emissions as part of the emission reductions verification process. This provision would allow regulated companies to trade emission reductions with non-regulated companies. 
   The EPA Administrator would be required to implement a comprehensive system for greenhouse gases reporting, inventorying, and reductions registrations. The system would be, to the maximum extent possible, complete, transparent and accurate. The system would also minimize costs incurred by entities in measuring and reporting of emissions. The Secretary of Commerce, within one year of enactment, would be required to develop measurement and verification standards and standards to ensure a consistent and accurate record of greenhouse gas emissions, emission reductions, sequestration, and atmospheric concentrations for use in the registry. 
   RESEARCH The bill would establish a scholarship program at the National Science Foundation for students studying climate change, require a report from the Department of Commerce on technology transfer, and require a report from the Secretary of Commerce on the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on the U.S. industrial competitiveness and international scientific cooperation. 
   The bill also would make changes to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, establish an abrupt climate change research program at the Department of Commerce, and establish a research program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the area of standards and measurement technologies.

SNOWE COSPONSORS LEGISLATION CRUCIAL TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, today announced the introduction of three bills introduced that impact coastal communities: the Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization Act, the Coastal and Ocean Mapping Integration Act, and the Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act.  
   Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization Act: 
   This legislation, introduced by Senator Snowe, would reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act and provide gradual increases in funding authorization for coastal programs, and reflects the bipartisan consensus developed by Snowe to help prevent polluted runoff, or non-point source pollution, and to increase funding for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. 
   ""America's coastal zone comprises only 17 percent of the contiguous U.S. land area, yet nearly 53 percent of all Americans live in these coastal areas,"" said Snowe. ""At the same time, it provides critical habitat for a variety of plants and animals, ranging from rare microscopic organisms to commercially valuable fish stocks. This legislation will enable our nation to improve the way we manage our valuable, yet vulnerable, coastal resources."" 
   Snowe's legislation, cosponsored by Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), tackles several major areas of coastal policy including: 
   Non-point Source Pollution - Polluted runoff, known as non-point source pollution, is degrading the condition of the Nation's coastal rivers, wetlands, and marine environments. Although the states currently take action to address this problem under existing authority, the passage of the Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization Act of 2005 would encourage them to take additional steps to combat the problem through the Coastal Community Program. The initiative provides states with the funding and flexibility needed to deal with their specific non-point source pollution problems. 
   Maine has dedicated a significant percentage of its coastal zone funding toward activities such as monitoring, mapping of watersheds, and local grants for mitigation of nonpoint source pollution, resulting in some of the nation's most proactive management practices that improve both water quality and quality of life for Maine residents, Snowe said. 
   Local, Community-Based Programs - The bill also increases federal and state support of local community-based programs that address coastal environmental issues, such as impact of development and sprawl. ""This type of bottom-up management approach is critical,"" said Snowe. ""It provides flexibility to communities so that they may design solutions to fit their unique coastal environmental problems. The program also allows communities to be proactive in protecting their coastal resources, preventing them from reaching a point where drastic action may become necessary."" 
   To provide further flexibility, the bill allows state matching funds to accrue in the aggregate, as opposed to requiring states to match each section individually. 
   National Estuarine Research - Snowe said the legislation reflects her work last year to increase funding for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. A network of reserves provides habitat for a wide variety of fish, invertebrates, birds and mammals, and serves as a natural laboratory for research and education. The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve in Maine is one such reserve. ""Our national reserve system has been expanding without a comparable increase in funding, and this legislation increases the federal funding to enable states to build upon the successes of their research and education programs,"" Snowe said. 
   Administrative Grants - Administrative grants serve as the base funding mechanism for the states' coastal management programs. Despite the fact that appropriations for these grants have increased in recent years , the Appropriations Committee has imposed a $2 million cap per state on the Administrative Grants. As a result, there has been an inequitable distribution of the new funds as larger and more populous states get stuck at the $2 million cap. In fiscal year 2000, 13 states accounted for 83 percent of the Nation's coastline and 76 percent of the coastal population had reached the $2 million cap. To address this problem, Snowe seeks to ensure fair distribution of funds by including a provision that directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide equitable increases and decreases between funding years for each state. 
   Coastal and Ocean Mapping Integration Act: 
   The goal of this bipartisan legislation is to create a much-needed cohesive national program for mapping the ocean floor, and provide it with the modest amount of funding necessary to make it successful. 
   ""In numerous cases throughout the country, including in the Gulf of Maine, knowledge of the ocean floor plays a critical part in sustainably managing our marine resources,"" said Snowe. ""This bill will create a coordinated approach to our nation's ocean mapping , bringing together all parties involved in ocean mapping to collaborate and pool their resources and infrastructure."" 
   Coastal and ocean maps give us a detailed look at the location of sensitive or endangered habitat, serving as a much-needed tool for ongoing conservation efforts. They provide us with information about the topography of the ocean floor, greatly assisting in the placement of ocean structures, and these maps are essential to the ongoing exploration of our oceans, leading to continuous new discoveries. 
   Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act: 
   This bill would lead to much needed improvements in our ocean habitats and coastal communities through various national and international initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of trash and other debris in coastal areas. 
   ""Our oceans are under assault from a wide range of human-induced threats, one of which is marine debris,"" said Snowe. ""Garbage in the marine environment is not only unsightly - it also threatens fish and wildlife habitat as well as human health and safety. As a coastal state Senator from a state with more than 5,000 miles of coastline, I fully support the goals of this bill, which will lead to much needed improvements in our ocean habitats and coastal communities.""

SNOWE, COLLINS, REPS. ALLEN, MICHAUD BACK EFFORT TO HELP MAINE FARMERS HURT BY EXCESSIVE RAIN, COLD WEATHER
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Susan Collins (R-ME) and Reps. Tom Allen (D-ME) and Michael Michaud (D-ME) have asked Mike Johanns, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to approve a request to declare Androscoggin, Aroostook, Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Piscataquis, Sagdahoc, Waldo, Washington and York Counties agricultural disaster areas.  
   ""Excessive rainfall and cold weather can be devastating to fruit and vegetable farmers,"" said the delegation in a joint statement. ""Maine farmers are already dealing with tremendous adversity, and denying them this aid could destroy any chance they might have at a profitable season. It is critical that we help these farmers as soon as we can in order to keep their farms financially viable and producing the crops that Maine and America depend on."" 
   The disaster request cites extensive production and physical losses that farmers have suffered due to excessive rainfall and cold weather during the growing season. If approved, Maine farmers would be eligible for disaster aid for crop losses suffered during the disaster period. 
   Snowe, Collins, Allen and Michaud are sending a formal letter of support to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns asking that he approve the disaster request and expedite efforts to bring financial aid to Maine farmers. 
   February 9, 2005 
   The Honorable Mike Johanns 
  Secretary of Agriculture 
  14 Street and Independence, S.W. 
  Room 200 A 
  Washington, DC 20250 
   Dear Secretary Johanns: 
   We are writing in support of the December 21, 2004 request made by Governor Baldacci for a Secretarial Disaster Determination for farmers in the following counties in Maine: Androscoggin, Aroostook, Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Piscataquis, Sagadahoc, Waldo, Washington and York. 
   Severe weather during the 2004 growing season has resulted in crop loss, as indicated by the USDA Potential Natural Disaster Damage Assessment Reports received from the Farm Service Agency Maine State Office, and subsequent economic hardship for farmers throughout the state of Maine. Excessive rain and wet conditions during 2004 caused production and/or physical losses to potatoes in Aroostoock County. The extremely cold winter with little snow cover and deep frost caused production and/or physical losses to apples, apple trees, blueberries, and cranberries in Androscoggin, Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Piscataquis, Sagadahoc, Waldo, Washington, and York Counties. Production losses to hay, pumpkins and winter squash in Knox, Lincoln and Somerset counties were also experienced because of the cold, wet spring and summer. 
   Secretarial Disaster Determination is extremely important for producers in Maine as they prepare for the 2005 season. Any delay in the designation will compound hardships on producers who already have faced extraordinary financial losses. 
   We ask that you approve Governor Baldacci's request for a disaster designation for the above counties as soon as possible. We thank you for time and consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   Olympia J. Snowe, U.S. Senator

SNOWE FIGHTS INEQUITIES IN IMMIGRATION LAW THAT HAVE HURT MAINE; INTRODUCES H2B VISA LEGISLATION
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, today announced that she is cosponsoring legislation, the ""Save our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act,"" to confront an H2B visa crisis situation that is directly hurting small businesses around the country, particularly in seasonally dependent states like Maine. This legislation was introduced by Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Judd Gregg (R-NH).  
   ""The lack of H-2B visa availability is an ongoing problem that can only become worse with the passing of each fiscal year,"" said Snowe. ""Those affected industries need relief, and they need it now. This is not a partisan immigration issue. For the sake of small businesses all across the nation, Congress must prioritize this issue in the early days of the 109th Congress and swiftly take action on this legislation."" 
   ""From bed-and-breakfasts to local restaurants, the small businesses that comprise Maine's largest economic sector rely on additional summer help from some 3,000 seasonal, foreign workers who hold an H-2B visa,"" said Snowe. ""Business owners all over Maine are in dire need of legislative action."" 
   Last year, the cap for Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 was reached in March, 2004, severely impacting year-round American jobs and small business owners whose livelihoods depend on a successful summer season. This year the cap for FY 2005 was reached in January of this year. During the last Congress, Senator Snowe cosponsored S.2258, the ""Summer Operations and Services (S.O.S.) Relief and Reform Act""and S. 2252, the ""Save Summer Act,"" and supported efforts to bring relief to employers in Maine and across the nation. 
   In Maine, approximately 87,000 jobs are directly tied to the success of tourism, which generates $13.9 billion for Maine's economy and $556 million in state tax revenue. 
   This legislative fix is designed to be a short term solution to the H2B visa shortage, in anticipation of comprehensive immigration reform to fix the long-term problem. This is two year fix. It does not raise the cap. It simply exempts returning workers who have played by the rules. Employees who have worked here before and returned to their home country are given the opportunity to return to the US to work another season under the H2B Visa program. 
   ""Current law favors winter employers over summer employers ,placing Maine's essential summer tourism at a disadvantage,"" said Snowe. ""This legislation directly addresses this regional inequity that has hurt Maine by allowing employers each season an equal opportunity to hire the workers they need."" 
   The H2B visa program allows businesses with seasonal needs to hire foreign workers to supplement their permanent and seasonal US workforce. These H2B workers fulfill a variety of short-term seasonal needs for employers when there are not enough US workers available. H2B employers need workers who are landscapers, lifeguards, seafood processors, ski instructors, horse trainers, resort workers, and carnival workers. 
   Employers can't just turn to the H2B program whenever they want seasonal workers. First, employers must try to vigorously recruit US workers. Employers must demonstrate to the Department of Labor that there are no US workers available to fill seasonal vacancies before they are allowed to these vacancies with H2B visa workers. 
   These foreign workers offer short-term help. Often the same individuals come back year after year and work for the same companies. They cannot and do not stay. Instead, they return home. The company they worked for must then go through the whole visa process again the following year, including proving that they cannot get US workers, before they can bring the worker back to the US for another season. 
   DETAILS OF THE ""SAVE OUR SMALL AND SEASONAL BUSINESSES ACT"" ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
   1. Exempting returning seasonal workers from the cap. 
   The bill exempts from the H2B cap workers who have already successfully participated in the H2B Visa Program. These are workers who have used the H2B program in one of the past three years and have returned home following their employment with a US company. Employers hiring these workers are still required to go through the whole visa process. Employers must still demonstrate that US workers are not available. But, after that process is successfully completed, any repeat worker brought in is exempt from the cap. This new system rewards those who have played by the rules, worked hard and successfully participated in the program. The bill also helps employers retain workers that are already trained to do their seasonal jobs. 
   2. Creates new anti-fraud provisions. 
   This bill will make sure that the government agencies processing the H2B visas have the resources they need to detect and prevent fraud. Under the bill, employers are required to pay an additional fee of $150 on each H2B petition and those fees are placed a Fraud Prevention and Detection account with the US Treasury. The bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to place these funds with the H1B and L anti-fraud fees so that the Departments of State, Homeland Security and Labor can use the funds to educate and train their employees to prevent fraud in each of these visa categories. 
   The bill also creates new sanctions for misrepresenting facts on a petition for an H2B visa. This provision is designed to further strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement power to sanction those who violate our nation's immigration laws. If an employer violates this section, the DHS will have the power to fine the individual employer and/or not approve their H2B petitions. A special provision is added to protect American workers, reserving the highest penalties for employer actions which involve harm to US workers. 
   3. Creates Fair Allocation of Visas 
   The bill creates a visa allocation system that is fair to all employers. It reserves half of the 66,000 visas for employers needing workers in the winter, and the second half for those needing workers in the summer. Dividing when visas are allocated ensures that - until a long-term solution is reached - employers who use winter labor and those who use summer labor will have an equal chance of getting the workers that they need. Because of increased demand and the existing cap, the current system favors winter employers to the detriment of summer employers. Under this new system at least some employers in each season will get the temporary workers they need. 
   The legislation also adds simply reporting requirements to ensure that Congress knows how many people are using the program, returning each year and/or had their visa status revoked or otherwise terminated.

SNOWE HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF CLASS ACTION REFORM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), an original cosponsor of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, today applauded the Senate for passing the bill by a vote of 72 to 26. This bipartisan legislation would enact key reforms in the handling of class action lawsuits, including diverting a greater number to federal court, in order to eliminate many costly procedural abuses that have arisen in recent years.  
   ""Class actions play a vital role in our legal system, but abuse of the litigation process is a drain on our legal system and our economy. Frivolous claims Should not be allowed to go forward only to the benefit of the lawyers who file them,"" said Snowe. ""This legislation will go a long way toward eliminating abuses that have become increasingly common in the last decade."" 
   A class action is a lawsuit filed collectively by plaintiffs with similar claims against the same defendant or defendants. A handful of state courts across the country are recognized as overly-friendly to plaintiffs in class action suits, and some attorneys have exploited legal technicalities in order to repeatedly bring class action suits in those sympathetic jurisdictions, even if none of the major parties in the case have any connection to that state. Often, lawyers in these cases receive millions in attorneys fees from the defendant companies, while the plaintiffs themselves receive little more than coupons. Such large monetary payouts to attorneys are often cited by manufacturers and other businesses as significant impediment to economic growth.
   ""Most complex legal cases of national importance belong in federal court because federal courts have particular expertise in adjudicating them."" said Snowe. ""This bill allows all parties to a lawsuit to have confidence that they will receive a fair trial, and provides that plaintiffs who have suffered injury at the hands of a defendant company receive just compensation, not meaningless coupons. At the same time, this bill protects the rights of states and their citizens by ensuring that legal actions of a truly local nature remain in state court."" 
   The Class Action Fairness Act would give federal courts jurisdiction over lawsuits if most of the plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of different states and at least $5 million is in controversy. However, the bill allows states to continue hearing such cases if most of the parties are from the same state, or if most of the events in question occurred in that state. The legislation also gives judges a far greater role in approving class action settlements, ensuring that plaintiffs actually receive a meaningful benefit from a large settlement.

SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL OCEAN OBSERVATION SYSTEM
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, today introduced the Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act of 2005, legislation that would establish a national system for gathering real-time ocean data, based upon the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observation System (GoMOOS). The national data system would augment and integrate a loosely-knit network of regional observation systems currently established in coastal zones across the country, giving all those who count on consistent and complete ocean data access to real-time information.  
   As we saw with the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami only weeks ago, the oceans are alive and ever-changing, said Snowe. A While our nations coast escaped the direct impact of this recent tragedy, it reminds us that those who live near or along our nations 95,000-plus miles of shoreline need to be able to quickly assess ocean-based threats, including tsunamis, hurricanes, harmful algal blooms, and pollution. The information this system would provide is essential to marine science and resource management as well as maritime transportation, safety, and commerce. 
   This bi-partisan, science-based bill would authorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to establish and maintain an integrated network of ocean observing and communication systems around our nations coastlines. This system would collect instantaneous data and information on ocean conditions B such as temperature, wave height, wind speed, currents, dissolved oxygen, salinity, contaminants, and other variables. 
   As a representative of a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I want to ensure that the citizens of Maine, and all coastal states, have the tools they need to monitor and assess what is happening off their shores, said Snowe. A The State of Maine has a strong and proud history rooted in our connection to the sea, as do other coastal states, and our coastal communities are highly dependent on the fisheries resources, coastal habitats, tourist destinations, safe harbors, and other essential services connected to the sea. The people of this countrys livelihoods are directly linked to how well we understand and adapt to changing ocean conditions. 
   Among its provisions, the AOcean and Coastal Observation Systems Act would: 
   * Develop and maintain an integrated marine data monitoring and management system that provides for comprehensive and continuous ocean and coastal observations; 
   * Facilitate timely warnings to coastal communities about potentially hazardous ocean conditions detected by coastal and offshore buoys, satellites, and other ocean observing instruments; 
   * Coordinate state agencies regional ocean observing systems efforts regarding data measurement requirements, standards and protocols for quality control, and data management and planning activities; 
   * Establish a research and development program to study the relationship between ocean conditions and human activities, develop new observation technologies, enhance security at US ports, and improve public education. 
   Snowe gave the following tangible examples of how this nationwide integrated ocean observing system will benefit Maine and the nation: 
   * Natural Distasters B Ocean observing system would detect hazardous ocean conditions - such as harmful algal blooms, oil spills, tsunamis, and hurricanes - and enable marine scientists to predict, track, and warn coastal communities about their potential impacts. 
   * Port Security B Ocean observing system will help ports Apush out their borders. By detecting the presence of harmful chemicals and tracking their paths, it will be able to ascertain biological threats and it will be able to track vessels and determine any possible suspicious activity. 
   * Fisheries Science B Ocean observing system would provide the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with critical nation-wide environmental data to improve fisheries modeling and management, coastal planning and harmful algal blooms management and mitigation. 
   * Coast Guard B Ocean observing system would provide the Coast Guard with valuable real-time information on sea-state conditions to determine when and how to conduct missions, including search-and-rescue activities. 
   * Navy B Ocean observing systems would provide the Navy with detailed observations and a variety of capabilities to support core Navy missions, improve tactical and strategic information for battlespace environments, improve submarine and mine detection, and develop improved sensor technologies.

  Following her reelection as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) today outlined an ambitious preliminary agenda for the 109th Congress, addressing many of the foremost concerns of small business owners, and aiming to reduce unnecessary burdens hampering small businesses from creating jobs.  
   Snowe's preliminary agenda includes initiatives to address the health insurance crisis, legal, regulatory and tax compliance burdens, access to capital, global competition and contract bundling, but is subject to expansion in response to the President's forthcoming Fiscal Year 2006 budget and the final legislative agenda issued by the Senate's leadership. 
   ""As the economy moves forward, we must work diligently to sustain the strides made in recent months and to lay a foundation supporting existing small business operations - while still nurturing budding entrepreneurs willing to invest their time and money to launch new business ventures,"" Snowe said. ""As a nation, we have reached a critical point where common sense and economic reality demand that policies affecting small businesses be given absolute priority to sustain growth."" 
   ""My goals for the Committee include maintaining and improving small business programs administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that will not only promote overall stability in the small business sector, but also that help prepare small firms to deal with difficult challenges over the long term, including global competition,"" she added. 
   Snowe was reelected unanimously by Senate Republicans on Wednesday to lead the Committee. ""I am honored by the confidence expressed by colleagues,"" she said. ""I look forward to remaining at the helm of this important Committee for the next two years. Many diverse issues and concerns face small business owners, and I pledge to continue my fight for legislation that will help them succeed, both in Maine and across the country,"" she added. 
   Under Snowe's leadership last year, a final resolution to the long delayed reauthorization of the SBA was passed and enacted into law, ensuring that the SBA assistance programs on which the small business community relies will be available over the next two years. Passage of the reauthorization, as part of the ""Ominbus Appropriations Act,"" (H.R. 4818) passed at the end of the 108th Congress, also will allow Senator Snowe and the Small Businesses Committee to devote more time to specific problems concerning small business owners. 
   Snowe also pledged to lead the Committee to address a broad array of issues, including vigorous oversight activities to ensure that SBA programs operate efficiently and provide practical assistance to help small businesses succeed. 
   Snowe's preliminary agenda includes: 
   * Health care: 
   Association Health Plans (AHPs) - access to health care and the cost of health insurance remain leading concerns of the nation's small businesses. As a result, ensuring final passage of AHP legislation and promoting greater competition in small group health insurance markets will be a key priority. 
   * Legal/regulatory burdens: 
   Small Business Compliance Assistance - legislation to help small firms better understand and comply with federal agency regulations by ensuring that the agencies' duties to publish how-to compliance guides as required by the ""Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act"" are clearly specified in the law. 
   * Litigation burdens: 
   The Committee will examine the unique challenges the current legal system imposes on small firms and evaluate options to alleviate those burdens. 
   Independent Office of Advocacy - legislation to erect a firewall around the SBA's Office of Advocacy and guard against political interference in its day-to-day management. 
   * Taxes: 
   Tax code simplification - initiatives to encourage changes in the tax code that simplify or reduce the paperwork and record keeping burdens affecting small businesses and the self employed as well as the costs associated with meeting IRS compliance regulations. 
   * Access to capital and markets: 
   SBIC Program Reform - promoting a consensus among Congress, the Administration and the SBIC industry to reform and improve the SBA's Participating Securities Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program. 
   * Trade and small manufacturers: 
   The Committee with strengthen existing trade assistance programs for small manufacturers and examine new options to promote and facilitate the success of small exporters in global markets. 
   * Procurement/federal contracting: 
   Contract Bundling - reforming federal procurement policies to strike a balance between encouraging contracting opportunities for small firms and promoting streamlined, high-efficiency buying practices by federal agencies.

With the help of this funding, Maine schools and libraries will be able to improve their telecommunications options and better prepare students for the global job market of the 21st century."" 
   The E-Rate program provides discounts of between 20 and 90 percent to schools and libraries - depending on their resources and needs - for the cost of education technology. This funding represents the discounts schools will receive for specific telecommunications services. The discounts cover the cost of telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections needed to bring information directly into classrooms and libraries. 
   The E-rate's first funding priority is for telecommunications services and Internet access, and the second funding priority is for internal connections and wiring at schools and libraries - beginning with the neediest applicants first - until the $2.1 billion fund is exhausted. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller gained the inclusion of their E-rate provision in the telecommunications reform bill by a single vote in the Senate Commerce Committee; successfully fought back an effort on the Senate floor to remove the provision from the bill; and defended the E-rate program during the two and one-half year implementation process at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) while ensuring it was implemented in a manner consistent with the language of the law and intent of the authors.

BAUCUS, SNOWE INTRODUCE SMALL BUSINESS TAX BILL
  Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) today introduced legislation to make permanent a tax credit for American employers who hire disadvantaged workers. The Senators unveiled their legislation following the Senate Finance Committee's first hearing of the 110th Congress, entitled ""Tax Incentives for Businesses in Response to a Minimum Wage Increase.""  
   ""America's minimum-wage workers have long deserved a raise. The 110th Congress is going to do the right thing and finally deliver a minimum wage increase. And at the same time, we should help keep jobs available to America's workers by helping small businesses absorb this wage hike,"" said Baucus. ""I intend for the Finance Committee to provide a package of appropriate tax incentives for small businesses this month, and to do it in a fiscally responsible way. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit targets employers who hire new workers at the minimum wage, and it's the right place to start."" 
   ""The strength of the American people lies in their desire and drive to work and provide for their families if only they have the opportunity. That's why I have long fought for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit that is an effective incentive for employers to hire those who need a job the most,"" said Snowe. ""Today, I couldn't be more pleased to join Senator Baucus in introducing this legislation that will finally bring permanency to the Work Opportunity Tax Credit."" 
   The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provides a credit of 40 percent on qualified wages up to $6,000 in wages, or less for fewer hours worked, to help cover the cost of wages for disadvantaged workers. From 1995 to 2005, WOTC helped move more than two million Americans from public assistance to gainful employment. The Baucus-Snowe legislation permanently extends WOTC and expands it to encourage employers to hire veterans who became disabled as a result of their service after September 11, 2001. WOTC is currently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. 
   At today's Finance Committee hearing, an employer of minimum-wage workers testified about the cost of training workers and the financial pressure small businesses experience when the minimum wage increases. Bruce Obenour, the president of a company that owns several fast-food restaurants in Ohio, called on the panel to make WOTC permanent, which the Baucus-Snowe bill will do. 
   ""We need the WOTC. It is well intentioned and effective. However it should be strengthened and expanded,"" said Obenour. ""These recommendations would contribute to reinvestment in the workforce and businesses in the near term to the benefit of the economy.""

SNOWE, CANTWELL LEGISLATION WOULD PRESERVE, MAINTAIN AMERICAN COASTAL REGIONS
  Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) today introduced legislation that would enhance the federal government's commitment to maintaining its valuable coastal resources.  
   ""The Coastal Zone Management Program has a long record of helping states achieve their coastal area management goals and maintaining clean, safe, and productive coastlines ultimately serves the best interest of our nation,"" Senator Snowe said. ""This program enjoys widespread support among coastal states, as demonstrated by the near unanimous participation by eligible states, and the many Commerce Committee members who have worked with me to strengthen this program over the past several years. I am pleased to introduce this legislation to provide our coastal states with the funding and management frameworks necessary to meet the ever-increasing conservation and development challenges facing our coastal communities."" 
   ""Our Coasts serve as centers of trade and commerce, economic engines, and homes for countless species,"" said Senator Cantwell. ""Environmentally friendly, more efficient management of our coasts will protect jobs, safeguard marine life, and keep our coasts clean."" 
   Congress originally passed the Costal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972, establishing a unique state-federal framework for facilitating sound coastal planning. The law gives states the opportunity to create a coastal zone management plan which, once approved, makes states eligible for matching federal funds to carry out the goals of its plan. This system allows states to tailor plans to their individual needs, but permits the federal government to ensure that marine resources-which often overlap political boundaries-are managed responsibly nationwide. As a result of this program's success, more than 99.9 percent of the United States' 95,376 shoreline miles are managed under this system, including, 34 of the 35 coastal and Great Lakes states and territories. The 35th, Illinois, has submitted a plan for federal approval. 
   However, the CZMA has not been reauthorized in more than a decade, and the program has been operating with authorization levels and mandates that expired in 1999. Yet, persistent threats to coastal areas such as increasing rates of non-point source water pollution and constriction of working waterfront areas have out-paced states' ability to maintain an appropriate balance between development and conservation. 
   The legislation would address the significant changes that have occurred since the last reauthorization of this critical program. The Coastal Zone Enhancement Reauthorization of 2007 significantly increases the authorization levels for the Coastal Zone Management Program, enabling states to better achieve their coastal management goals. The bill authorizes $170 million for fiscal year 2008 and increases the authorization levels up to $193.5 million for fiscal year 2012. Additionally, the legislation would encourage states to take additional voluntary steps to combat these problems through the Coastal Community Program.

SNOWE JOINS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO PRESERVE AND IMPROVE RURAL AIR SERVICE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today joined Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Ben Nelson (D-NE) in introducing bipartisan legislation that would preserve and expand rural air service. The Rural Aviation Improvement Act of 2007 would enhance vital components of the Essential Air Service program to increase access to commercial air service for passengers in rural parts of the country, like Maine. 
   ""A robust transportation network is critical to the economies of rural states like Maine and it is imperative that Congress works to bridge the transportation gap by improving access to commercial air service for these areas,"" said Senator Snowe. ""This legislation is a vital component of that goal and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ensure that the Essential Air Service program is not only retained, but better developed so that our state has the same economic development opportunities that other urban areas already do.""  
   As a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees our nation's air service, Senator Snowe has been a staunch supporter of the Essential Air Service Program and has worked diligently to increase rural air service to guarantee that Maine is connected to the nation's transportation network. Maine currently has four EAS airports: Augusta State Airport, Hancock County - Bar Harbor Airport, Knox County Airport in Rockland and Northern Maine Regional Airport in Presque Isle. 
   Key provisions of the bill include: 
   * Repealing a provision put in place by the 2002 FAA Reauthorization requiring a community to pay a portion of the cost (up to 20%) to keep its limited commercial air service. Annual Congressional action has prevented this provision from being enacted with an amendment to the Transportation-Housing Appropriations bill. 
   * Modifying an existing provision that caps the EAS subsidy at $200 per passenger for communities within 210 miles of a medium or large hub airport. The cap was set in 2000 and has never been adjusted for inflation or increases in airline costs. The bill includes an annual increase in the cost cap to reflect inflation. 
   * Allowing a community or state where the subsidy has exceeded the per passenger cost cap in Section 3 to pay the difference in the per passenger cost and thus retain its essential air service. Under current law, a community's commercial service is terminated if the statutory cap is exceeded. 
   * Allowing a community or state to pay the difference in cost for a individually determined 'preferred level' of commercial air service above the minimum level provided for by EAS or to pay the difference in cost of a preferred air carrier above the low-cost bidder. 
   * Requiring the Department of Transportation to calculate distances to the nearest hub airport (see Section 3 for the importance of such mileage) by using the most commonly used route instead of the shortest route available. 
   * Establishing an Office of Rural Aviation within the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. The office will be changed with the development of a uniform 4-year contract for EAS (the current contract length is 2 years), develop a uniform set of metrics and a mechanism to fairly compare applications from all air carriers bidding to provide essential air service to communities, and to select air carriers from among air carriers applying to provide essential air service. 
   * Extending through 2011 the authority to make grants to communities under the Small Community Air Service Development Program. 
   * Including incentives for airlines to participate and stay in the EAS program by requiring subsidy payments to be adjusted to reflect changes in operating cost, such as the cost of fuel. 
   * Requiring FAA to include passenger boardings on charter flights departing from EAS communities to be included in total the passenger boardings used to calculate an airport's annual apportionment for the Airport Improvement Program, which is currently delineated by a 10,000 enplanement threshold. If you are below that threshold, you are eligible for $150,000. If above, $1 million. Currently, charter enplanements are not counted as part of the 10,000 enplanement threshold which determines this apportionment. 
   * Retaining the mandatory $50 million annual appropriation from the overflight fund. Re-establishes a mandatory additional $50 million annual appropriation from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Raises the total annual authorized funding to $133 million from the current $127 million to assure a more secure source of federal funding for all eligible EAS communities and any new communities.

SNOWE DELIVERS KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT LISBON HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION ON JUNE 11
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) today delivered the keynote address at the 2007 Lisbon High School graduation ceremony at the Lewiston Armory. 
   Excerpts of the speech as prepared for delivery: 
   ""Few occasions are cause for greater pride and warmer memories than a high school graduation, so I am grateful to you for inviting me here today, and I am honored to join in these special moments with you - congratulations to you all. 
   Graduation speakers, in pursuit of sound advice and lofty ideals to present to captive graduating seniors, are always trying to find the good things that no one has ever said before. Usually, when that challenge is considered at graduation time, it's from the perspective of ""now, what are you going to do with the rest of your life""?  
   Most of you would respond to the ""now what?"" question by saying that you're going to attend a four-year college, or one of Maine's superior community colleges, become a full-time member of America's work force, or join the United States Armed Forces. But I would offer that, in the long run, there is an additional perspective that you may want to take. Instead of trying to map out your entire future, let me suggest focusing foremost on what kind of person you want to be, and how you will actually choose to live. Because I can tell you firsthand, there is no perfect plan...no straight course through life. 
   But no matter what challenges may come your way, I have found in my own life that by maintaining your values and integrity...setting high expectations and goals...and believing in yourself ...you can not only survive...but thrive. And that's all the more true as you are entering a world that will surround you with challenges from the demands of a changing economy and workforce, to today's accelerated speed of existence that far outpaces the time in which I received my high school diploma. 
   The real question is, in this whirlwind of change that will be often exciting and sometimes overwhelming, how will you stay grounded in what is truly important? And this is where I give you the good news - that while we are members of much different generations, there are certain constants that transcend age, and one of them is that the greatest limits that will be placed on your lives are the ones which you place on yourself. 
   As someone who grew up right here in Lewiston-Auburn, I well recall when I was sitting at my own high school graduation from Edward Little just across the river, it certainly never occurred to me to think that I'd ever be a United States Senator. You see, my parents, hardworking people - my father, an immigrant, my mother, a first generation American - had died before I was 10, and my aunt and uncle took me into their family, which already included five children. My uncle was a barber, and my aunt worked just a few blocks from here in the old Continental Mill - on the third shift to be precise. So we weren't exactly overburdened with a lot of money. 
   But early on in my life, I realized that I had two choices - either allow myself to become overwhelmed by adversities, or learn something from them. And it certainly didn't hurt that I had been surrounded by the twin pillars of family and faith growing up...the kind of setting that instills confidence and hope - and from that, a belief in oneself - that was only strengthened by a first-rate education such as you have received right here at Lisbon High. As such, I never accepted from others nor restricted myself to the idea that there were things that I couldn't do if I so chose. So, by placing no restrictions on your horizons, a broad range of possibilities exists for each and every one of you. 
   I also hope that, in thinking about how you will live your life, you will consider that the mark of the truly successful individual will be to work and live within a system of beliefs and strongly-held values that have long-graced our country...values of community and fairness, of honesty and hard work. A place where your paycheck only measures your income, not your worth as a person. 
   It's been said that ""only by holding fast to unchanging principles in changing times will you do justice to yourself, your family, and your community."" By sticking with these principles, you won't be making your life's decisions in a vacuum...you'll have the backdrop of a strong moral and ethical framework to guide you. And that foundation couldn't be more vital given the frenzied pace of life and the constant bombardment of information that have become hallmarks of your generation. 
   Consider that a relatively short time ago in human history - about 300 years or so - it was still possible for one individual to know virtually everything. Well, no one could do that today. The reality is, you are already immersed in a world with instant access to more information from infinite sources and greater and more astounding technologies than at any time in the history of humankind. 
   In fact, incredibly, while it took two centuries to fill the shelves of the Library of Congress with more than 57 million manuscripts, 29 million books and periodicals, and 12 million photographs - in 2007 the world generates nearly one-hundred times that amount of information digitally...every day. And YouTube alone consumes as much bandwidth today as the entire Internet consumed in 2000 - just seven years ago. 
   Twenty-four hours a day, virtually anywhere, you can get news...you can listen to music...you can watch videos...you can text-message and email and download podcasts. We had record players, you have Ipods. We had rotary phones connected by wires if you can believe it - you have cell phones that can do just about everything other than pumping gas and washing dishes. We had diaries - you have MySpace, and Facebook. 
   Today, we are barraged with images and information around the clock, seven days a week, over satellite, cable, computers, blackberries, smartphones, DVD's, blogs, over our HDTV's from CSPAN, Fox News, CNN, MTV, ESPN, MSNBC. We live in an age of staggering immediacy. Yet, even as instantaneous as this glut of information is, the answers to our most compelling challenges as a nation and a world cannot simply be ""Googled."" 
   Just think about it - we are in the midst of a technological revolution that may well eclipse even the Industrial Revolution. So how is it that - with all of our stunning and innovative breakthroughs - we still face the perilous confrontations of a war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism? How is it that students right here in America still choose to end the lives of classmates in their own schools - as we saw with the unspeakable and incomprehensible loss of 32 lives at Virginia Tech? How is it that we have come so far with our machines, but we still have so far to go when it comes to each other? 
   The fact is, CNN can broadcast what's happening live in a battle zone...or stream footage of a campus tragedy from someone's cell phone video...but it's up to us to help stop such horrific events from ever reoccurring. Technology can show us the deplorable inhumanity of the more than 200,000 ethnic killings in the African region of Darfur - that's over five times the population of Lewiston - but it is up to us to help end the suffering. It can deliver us images of the decay in our own inner-cities - as we saw most explicitly in New Orleans in the horrific aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - but it is up to us to rebuild that devastated region. 
   These pressing issues and many more should hopefully sound an alarm that will be heard above the noise of daily life. That what's required is more involvement, not less - and that you not be satisfied, in the words the poet Robert Frost, ""to go with the drift of things, but rather to be engaged in the world around you - a full participant in the world in which you live..."" 
   Certainly, an excellent example is how it's all the more critical in this high tech world to ensure we take care of our planet. Because it matters that polar ice caps are melting and sea levels are rising...it matters when polar bears and other species begin to disappear. Here in America, while we represent about five percent of the world's population, we contribute at least 20 percent of the planet's manmade greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. 
   Of course, you alone can't solve this problem. But all of you together, doing your part - whether it's reducing household trash 25 percent which would cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 1,000 pounds a year...or using more energy efficient appliances which could reduce harmful emissions by 175 million tons...or of course, through recycling here in Maine, which has been at the forefront of environmental leadership - doing all of this together you can make a difference 
   As the fabled Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi once said, be the change you wish to see in the world. And in that light, we could no better than to look to the shining example of one of our own - a young woman from Yarmouth, Maine, named Hanley Denning. 
   Sadly, Hanley lost her life in a tragic car accident earlier this year - yet her young life will always stand in testament to the ability and - I would say - imperative of one individual to make a difference. Just 26 years of age, she took it upon herself not just to get involved, but to take action - founding an organization called Safe Passage to provide children who live in the Guatemala City garbage dump with opportunity and hope through education, nutrition, and health care. 
   Today, remarkably, Safe Passage serves as many as 600 boys and girls - and Hanley's life is a poignant reminder that, while we can transmit messages and images in nanoseconds around the world, technology alone could not substitute for what she was doing, on the ground, on the front lines of the world's forgotten children. Technology can telegraph and make clear what we must do, but Hanley actually did it ...and she changed the world. That's why more than one thousand people gathered in Portland for a memorial to a person who inspired not only her country, but one that wasn't even her own. 
   Thankfully, Hanley's incredible deeds are preserved on film, online, and in the media. In fact, a documentary about Safe Passage entitled - A Recycled Life - was nominated for an Oscar this year. But it remains up to us to advance the message of Hanley's legacy...that it is only through our active participation in our communities - and our determined commitment to contribute to the common good of the world around us - that we truly succeed as citizens and as people. 
   Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. once said that ""The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving."" Your graduation today signals to one and all that you are already headed in the right direction - and that you are more than well-equipped with the knowledge, skill, and character to chart and steer this next leg of your journey. 
   As you leave here, I hope you will seize the limitless potential inside yourselves and act upon it - and, let me add, I hope you take your hard-won ""license to achieve"" and choose to do so right here in Maine - because we need you. So Good luck to all of you...God Bless...and congratulations to the Lisbon High School graduating Class of 2007.

SNOWE SPEAKS OUT ON AMENDMENT 13 COURT DECISION
  While continuing to express her concern at the challenges that Maine's fishermen continue to face, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) believes today's Federal Court decision to mostly uphold Amendment 13, New England fishing regulations that came into affect last May, will provide New England's fishermen with a limited level of certainty after years of uncertainty and will not lead to more restrictive regulations. Snowe is pleased that the Court correctly ruled that Amendment 13 is sufficiently protecting fisheries.  
   ""I cannot say enough how difficult Amendment 13 continues to be on the fishermen of Maine and New England, placing difficult and inflexible regulations on a community that is struggling to survive,"" said Snowe, Chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard. ""I hope that today's federal court ruling at the very least will provide an element of closure and certainty to New England fishermen. For too long, they have waited for this ruling and today - at long last - they have it. They now know that these rules will not be further tightened. Now we must turn a new page to build a better framework that both works to increase our fish stocks, while being more responsive to our fishermen's needs."" 
   Snowe is particularly pleased that the Court struck down a provision that allowed the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to override the New England Fishery Management Council's ability to determine catch sizes on eastern Georges Bank. The U.S. and Canada share fishing rights to this vital fishing ground. 
   ""The bright side of this ruling is that the New England Fishery Management Council retains the right to determine how much fish is caught on eastern Georges Bank - not NMFS. This is wise as we have to allow flexibility and local input to be a guiding principle in fisheries policy,"" continued Snowe. 
   Over the past four years, Senator Snowe has taken an active role throughout the development of Amendment 13 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan to ensure that the rules are constructed in a way that takes into account their potential social and economic impact on fishing communities in Maine and throughout New England. Snowe has worked closely with the New England Fishery Management Council and National Marine Fisheries Service to address aspects of Amendment 13 that unfairly penalize fishermen, and continues efforts to encourage framework adjustments that correct inequities in the rules for Maine fishermen and fishing communities. 
   Snowe has voiced her concern over provisions of Amendment 13 that: 
   * Penalize Maine fishermen who assisted the recovery of groundfish stocks in past years by harvesting other species, such as lobster and shrimp - a practice known as ""latent effort."" Under the current proposal, these fishermen would lose those groundfish days allocated to them but not used in past years; and 
   * Limit the types of Special Access Programs, which could allow targeted fishing on healthy stocks, to only a small subset of those that were proposed and considered by the Council. Future Special Access Permit programs can be considered for the Framework adjustments, but they will not be in place in time to provide fishing opportunities before this fall. 
   ""We need a federal fisheries policy that can be interpreted and applied in ways that recognize and respond to the unique conditions facing each individual fishery. It needs to reflect the reality that many fish stocks have rebounded in recent years and do not always need to remain under unnecessarily restrictive regulations,"" said Snowe. ""Of the hundreds of fisheries on our nation's coastline, no two are exactly alike. The conservation measures that work in one fishery cannot always be transferred to another. The Magnuson-Stevens Act must express enough flexibility to accommodate these variations, so that managers can craft unique, innovative solutions based on the conditions and needs of the fish stocks and fishing communities in question. It has become clear in recent years that implementation of the Act has not fully reflected the flexibility that Congress intended. I will be working with Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-AK) to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Act this year to improve it be more reflective of the needs of our fishing communities."" 
   Snowe also wants to remove the 10 year rebuilding time line the Magnuson-Stevens Act so that similar cases to Amendment 13 are never again repeated.

SNOWE PLEASED BY COMMERCE COMMITTEE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO SAFEGUARD OCEANS
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, Chair of Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, believes that today's Commerce Committee action has placed four pieces of ocean-related legislation on the fast track for full Senate consideration to safeguard our oceans. The following legislation was passed out of the Committee today, including Snowe's Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act (S. 361), the National Ocean Exploration Program Act (S. 39), the Marine Debris Research Prevention and Reduction Act (S. 362) and the Tsunami Preparedness Act (S. 50). 
   ""Our oceans are not only an ecological treasure, but an economic asset that contributes billions of dollars to our world's economies. If we do not take steps now to safeguard our oceans, future generations will be unable to enjoy and make their livelihoods from this most critical natural resource,"" said Snowe. ""Today's quick action by the Senate Commerce Committee to report out four pieces of ocean-related legislation, including my Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act, is indeed good news for those of us who are committed to moving our oceans to the forefront of congressional action. With Chairman Stevens' full support, it is my hope that this legislation will come to the floor of the Senate in an expeditious manner.""  
   Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act: 
   ""As a representative of a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I want to ensure that the citizens of Maine, and all coastal states, have the tools they need to monitor and assess what is happening off their shores,"" said Snowe. ""The State of Maine has a strong and proud history rooted in our connection to the sea, as do other coastal states, and our coastal communities are highly dependent on the fisheries resources, coastal habitats, tourist destinations, safe harbors, and other essential services connected to the sea. This legislation is essential to our understanding and our ability to adapt to changing ocean conditions."" 
   Among its provisions, the ""Ocean and Coastal Observation Systems Act"" would: 
   * Develop and maintain an integrated marine data monitoring and management system that provides for comprehensive and continuous ocean and coastal observations; 
   * Facilitate timely warnings to coastal communities about potentially hazardous ocean conditions, such as harmful algal blooms, detected by coastal and offshore buoys, satellites, and other ocean observing instruments; 
   * Coordinate state agencies' regional ocean observing systems' efforts regarding data measurement requirements, standards and protocols for quality control, and data management and planning activities; and 
   * Establish a research and development program to study the relationship between ocean conditions and human activities, develop new observation technologies, enhance security at US ports, and improve public education. 
   The National Ocean Exploration Program Act: 
   ""Establishing a national program for ocean exploration and research will provide the necessary resources to produce groundbreaking oceanic discoveries,"" said Snowe. ""With so much of the underwater environment still unexplored, there is great opportunity to further develop oceanographic research and expand our knowledge of the world's oceans."" 
   The Senate Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which would administer the new program. In carrying out the program, the administrator of NOAA would conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey little known areas of the oceans and give priority attention to deep ocean regions, with a focus on surveying deep water marine systems that hold potential for important scientific and medical discoveries, such as hydrothermal vent communities and seamounts. The bill builds on recommendations from the final report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for a more robust and coordinated U.S. ocean exploration program. 
   In addition, the National Ocean Exploration Act would require NOAA to convene an ocean technology and infrastructure task force to develop and implement a strategy to: 
   * Facilitate the transfer of new exploration technology to the program. 
   * Improve the availability of communications infrastructure (including satellite) to the program. 
   * Develop a data management information processing system for information obtained under the program. 
   * Encourage cost-sharing partnerships to assist in transferring exploration technology and technical expertise to the program. 
   Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act: 
   This bill would lead to much needed improvements in our ocean habitats and coastal communities through various national and international initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of trash and other debris in coastal areas. 
   ""Our oceans are under assault from a wide range of human-induced threats, one of which is marine debris,"" said Snowe. ""Garbage in the marine environment is not only unsightly - it also threatens fish and wildlife habitat as well as human health and safety. As a coastal state Senator from a state with more than 5,000 miles of shoreline, I fully support the goals of this bill, which will lead to much needed improvements in our ocean habitats and coastal communities."" 
   Tsunami Preparedness Act: 
   ""The Tsunami Preparedness Act will act to not only safeguard our own citizens, but actively works to encourage greater coordination and cooperation internationally to better share information which is paramount in saving lives,"" said Snowe. ""This is legislation that I believe will help mitigate against a future cataclysmic event like the one that took the lives of over 250,000 people through out South Asia."" 
   Below are details of the Tsunami Preparedness Act: 
   * This bill directs NOAA to operate regional tsunami detection and warning systems in the Pacific Ocean region, and in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico region. The system shall cover all areas of the Pacific Ocean and any area in the Atlantic and Caribbean that NOAA determines is at-risk of tsunami. The system shall utilize such components as deep ocean detection buoys and tide gauges, as well as cooperation and data sharing between NOAA and USGS. 
   * Included in the detection and warning system is the establishment of tsunami warning centers, including the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, and the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska, in order to monitor data from seismological, deep ocean, and tidal monitoring station, as well as evaluate earthquakes that may have potential to generate tsunami, and disseminate information and warning bulletins. 
   * The bill also authorizes NOAA to establish a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program to improve tsunami preparedness of at-risk areas. The bill establishes a coordinating community for this program consisting of representatives from NOAA, FEMA, USGS, NSF, and affected coastal states and territories. This program will improve inundation mapping, community outreach and education, and promote and integrate tsunami warning and mitigation measures, including rescue and recovery guidelines. 
   * The bill requires NOAA to establish, along with other agencies and academic institutions, a tsunami research program to develop detection, prediction, communication, and mitigation science and technology to support tsunami forecasts and warnings. 
   * The bill also requires NOAA to immediately repair, and ensure the deployment of existing deep ocean detection buoys and related components of the detection and warning system, and to notify Congress upon any equipment or system failures that will impair regional detection, and of significant contractor failures or delays. 
   * The bill requires NOAA, and the United States Interagency Committee to provide technical assistance and advice to international entities as part of an international effort to develop a fully functional global tsunami warning system. 
   * The bill authorizes $35 million to carry out this act.

SNOWE RECEIVES 'SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE' AWARD FROM U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
  Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) today received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's 'Spirit of Enterprise' award for her support of pro-business issues during the second session of the 108th Congress.  
   ""I would like to thank the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for bestowing such a great honor upon me. The importance of their work in promoting business and entrepreneurship throughout the nation cannot be overstated,"" said Snowe. ""As our nation continues to rebound from an economic downturn, we must continue to endeavor to keep our economy on track with a record of continued growth. By working together, we can ensure that American business - particularly small business, the engine of our economic recovery - has a bright and prosperous future."" 
   Snowe has concerns regarding funding for the Small Business Administration (SBA), and its lending programs including the valuable Microloan Program. She recently sent a letter to Senate Budget Chairman Judd Gregg and Ranking Member Kent Conrad, requesting FY06 funding for the SBA of $55 million above the SBA's Fiscal Year 2005 appropriations to preserve the SBA's Microloan program and core technical assistance programs. 
   ""During the 109th Congress, I look forward to utilizing the Small Business Committee to address the diverse issues and concerns facing small business owners. After all, most of our large businesses were once small businesses proving their indispensable importance to our nation,"" concluded Snowe. 
   This is the seventeenth year that the U.S. Chamber has formally honored the accomplishments of a select group of members of Congress. The Chamber awards the Spirit of Enterprise based on rankings it gives members of Congress for key business votes, set out in its annual publication, How They Voted. Votes included in the rankings are Chamber-designated ""key votes,"" recorded floor votes on issues established as priorities by the Chamber's board of directors on which the Chamber communicates its position prior to the vote.

  Today the Senate passed the Bankruptcy Reform bill, which would reduce abuse of the current bankruptcy system, by a vote of 74 to 25. This legislation includes an amendment introduced by Sens. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that would ensure that the private, personal identification information filed in bankruptcy proceedings does not fall into the hands of criminals.  
   ""I applaud the majority of my Senate colleagues for voting for this commonsense reform, and I am especially pleased that privacy legislation I offered with my colleagues, Senators Leahy and Cantwell, was included in the bill,"" said Snowe. ""Because court documents, including bankruptcy filings, are public record and increasingly available online, individuals' safety and property could be in jeopardy. Our amendment will prevent these harmful invasions of privacy from ever occurring."" 
   Bankruptcy court filings, like most other court proceedings, are public record, and most papers filed in these cases are publicly available. Such information includes not only a person's name and address, but information such as the person's Social Security number, date of birth, and driver's license number. While this information has long been available for public review at our nation's courthouses, in today's information age, more and more federal courts are making all of their public documents available online as well. This technological advancement potentially opens up opportunities for abuse for identity thieves and others who access the internet with the intent to commit fraud, physical harm, or other crimes. 
   In Maine, this new legislation will affect fewer than ten percent of the people who file under Chapter 7, and it would affect no one who earns less than the median state income. The bill also names low-income veterans, service-members called to active duty, and debtors with severe health problems as people who automatically qualify as having ""special circumstances"" and can therefore file under Chapter 7 and have their debts forgiven, regardless of their income.

  By Sen. Olympia J. Snowe
   The expression, ""give a man a fish and he eats for one day; teach a man to fish and he eats for the rest of his life,"" goes to the heart of how we can make Welfare as we know it a more successful program. Most Americans who rely on Welfare want nothing more than to get out of this program and move onto a path of self-sufficiency and a bright and successful future.  
   For those of us in Congress, we have the means before us of accomplishing that goal. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have worked with my colleagues to pass out of Committee legislation to reauthorize the Welfare bill, which is already 3 years overdue. We have made significant improvements to this essential program - now we must work to ensure that this legislation receives the President's signature and starts helping those who most need it.
   Welfare, which is officially called The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program, is an essential program that works to improve the livelihoods of families that are the most in need. It provides assistance and work opportunities to struggling families by granting States the federal funds and wide flexibility to develop and implement their own welfare programs. I have long been a supporter of this program and as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have worked to increase funding for some of the program's most important provisions and encourage reauthorization of the entire bill.
   TANF strives to move recipients into work and turn welfare into a program of temporary assistance. Under the welfare reform legislation of 1996, TANF replaced the old welfare programs known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program and the Emergency Assistance (EA) program. The law ended federal entitlement to assistance and instead created TANF as a block grant that provides States and tribes federal funds each year. These funds cover benefits, administrative expenses, and services targeted to needy families. 
   It is time for us to enact a specific blueprint for TANF for the future- one that builds on past successes while addressing the shortcomings revealed by time. The recent Finance Committee mark up of this bill, which enhances work requirements but also improves flexibility for states to help remove barriers to employment, contains a number of positive, commonsense provisions that will prove to be extremely beneficial.
   For example, the bill rightly recognizes that some families face longer-term barriers than others. It will allow states to count people who are caregivers of a disabled dependent as meeting the requirements under certain circumstances. It also give states flexibility by providing partial credit toward a state's work participation rate when there is partial compliance with hourly requirements by recipients.
   One of the most important provisions that I successfully worked to have included in the bill is adequate child care funding. If the aim of welfare reform is to move people off the welfare rolls and onto payrolls, providing support in the form of quality child care is a prerequisite to realizing that goal. This bill includes mandatory child care funding which is a critical element to the success of welfare reform. There is no question of the need of such an inclusion because it is impossible for parents to return to work if they are unable to find or afford adequate child care. Under the provisions of this bill, working Mainers in the TANF program would receive an extra $4 million per year for childcare and the program overall would receive an extra $5 billion. 
   Another provision that I had included is expanded state flexibility option is based on Maine's highly successful ""Parents as Scholars"" program. This program counts college and vocational education as work and allows up to 10 percent of the state's TANF caseload to take part. Maine's program has been wildly successful, with graduates averaging a 50 percent increase in salaries and with 90 percent of working graduates leaving welfare permanently. Increased education is a critical factor in whether a person will transition off welfare and keep a job with a decent income.
   I believe these provisions will secure the future success of TANF because they uphold the original intent of the legislation passed in 1996- to assist states in helping TANF clients to move onto payrolls and to remain employed. It moves individuals toward self-sufficiency through vocational training and post secondary education opportunities. It also ensures that parents can afford childcare so they can return to the workforce.
   It is my hope that the TANF reauthorization bill will be able to pass in both the House and the Senate this year. We must not let petty disputes get in the way of passing legislation that could positively and significantly impact the lives of many Americans. This program provides a vital safety net that works to support lower-income Americans and it's time that these programs had a blueprint for the future.

SNOWE JOINS SENATE REPUBLICAN TASK FORCE IN PRESENTING 'TOOLBOX' OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP AMERICA'S UNINSURED
  At a press conference today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) joined her colleagues in the Senate Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured in unveiling its blueprint for addressing the problems of rising health care costs and the uninsured. Snowe, Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, explained the provisions recommended by the Task Force to make coverage more available, emphasizing the overall importance of Association Health Plans (AHPs) and their role in providing health insurance to small businesses.  
   ""Today the Republican Task Force on Health Care Costs and the Uninsured came together to recognize that while ensuring health care for all Americans is indeed a daunting task, it is not insurmountable. Today we take yet another step forward toward providing improved health care access for all Americans through common sense, multi-pronged approaches,"" said Snowe. 
   ""With nearly 44 million Americans lacking health coverage at some point in the last year, with the Institute of Medicine estimating that 18,000 deaths a year could be attributed to a lack of health coverage when a family of four pays almost $10,000 a year for health insurance, and when costs continue to rise at an unsustainable rate - and we already spend nearly 15 percent of GDP on health care, or $1.7 trillion - we should all be able to agree that we can't put off action any longer,"" said Snowe. 
   ""So the question is not the need but rather the method. We start from the sound premise that when it comes to a solution, one size will not fit all. Needs differ, people differ and so Americans want and deserve choices,"" said Snowe. ""That's why the Task Force has been working to identify a 'toolbox' of proposals to build a legislative framework of thoughtful, sustainable reforms, based on sound principles of increased choice, competition and fiscal responsibility - so we can address the three core issues of improving care, controlling costs, and of course - providing coverage."" 
   Snowe noted that she is pleased that the Task Force included Association Health Plans in its recommendations. 
   ""AHPs are consistent with our principles not only of providing greater affordability, but also flexibility for businesses, and market competition - all at nominal costs for the federal government. According to CBO and SBA's Office of Advocacy, these plans would operate with administrative costs as much as 30 percent lower than traditional small group insurance plans - with the potential to benefit more than half of all uninsured working Americans today,"" said Snowe. 
   ""Moreover, at a time when insurance rates have been skyrocketing by 30 percent and more over the past 3 to 4 years for small businesses and at a time when nearly two thirds of the 44 million uninsured Americans are either employed by a small business or dependent on someone who is, shouldn't we be making it easier, not harder for them to provide health care coverage?,"" said Snowe. ""That's why as Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, I introduced the Small Business Health Fairness Act to establish nationally-based Association Health Plans for all our small businesses, so they can pool their employees nationally to buy insurance at lower costs through volume purchasing - just as large employers and unions are permitted to do. Small businesses create as much as 75 percent of the new jobs in this country and we need to given them as much help as possible so they can provide the benefits necessary to attract the quality employees they need. Why should small businesses be discriminated against?"" 
   Snowe, sponsor of S.545, ""The Small Business Health Fairness Act,"" a bill she introduced to create national AHPs, is pleased that a broad coalition of over 170 associations representing 12 million employers and 80 million employees has developed in support of Snowe's bipartisan legislation. ""The strength of this idea is in the large numbers of small businesses across the country who are clamoring for this,"" said Snowe. 
   Her legislation awaits consideration by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. 
   Discussing the issue of coverage, Snowe said that the approach to increasing coverage should be multi-faceted and should improve affordability: ""While we clearly need to address the issue of the uninsured, we have a responsibility to pay heed to our federal budget deficits,"" said Snowe. ""That is why AHPs are both a fiscally responsible and effective manner to help cover the millions of uninsured in our nation."" The Task Force recommendations are broken down into three categories: CARE, COVERAGE and COST. Task Force documents are available at http://republican.senate.gov/costcoveragecare.

SNOWE, COLLEAGUES, URGE APPROPRIATORS TO BOOST FUNDS FOR KEY SBA PROGRAMS; JOBS, ECONOMIC SECURITY AT STAKE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and four colleagues today called on Senate appropriators to boost funding levels for key Small Business Administration (SBA) programs, an investment she called ""essential to make our nation's economic security a priority, create jobs and strengthen the economy."" 
   In a letter to Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH), Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary and Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC), the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Snowe urged the appropriators to add funding above the President's Budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 to help sustain a range of programs critical to the small business community. She was joined by Senator Kit Bond (R-MO), Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN) as co-signers.  
   ""This increase is absolutely necessary to provide the SBA with the resources it needs to serve America's 23 million small businesses, including its vital small business manufacturers,"" Snowe added, commenting on the release of the letter. 
   The President's budget request reduces the SBA's overall budget to $678 million - a 15 percent reduction from FY 2004, mostly from a change in the vital 7(a) Loan Program. The reduction of $119 million in overall SBA funding would significantly affect a range of critical programs and services, including 7(a) Guaranteed Loans, the Small Business Development Center Program, the Microloan Program, Women's Business Centers, SCORE, U.S. Export Assistance Centers and FAST Rural Outreach Program. 
   ""Small Business is the engine of job growth in our economy,"" Snowe said. ""A larger investment in our small businesses will help sustain job growth in this important economic sector and pay dividends in the form of improved growth in the economy overall."" 
   Highlights from Senator Snowe's letter to the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee: 
   7(a) Loan Program: ""Small businesses must have access to a strong 7(a) loan Program to obtain long-term financing that would not otherwise be available. Last year, approximately 67,000 small businesses that could not obtain comparable credit elsewhere were approved for loans in the 7(a) Program. The SBA requested no appropriated funds for the program in FY 2005, and announced plans to raise fees on lenders and borrowers, and reduce guarantee rates, to substitute for appropriations. For FY 2005, Snowe recommended appropriations of $129 million for the 7(a) Program. This is only approximately 15 percent more than the $101 million available in FY 2004, rather than the additional 30 percent that would have been necessary to meet demand in FY 2004. 
   ""You should be aware that the Committee is currently working to construct a solution to further reduce the program's subsidy rate for FY 2005 and beyond. If Congress passes legislation to reduce the program's costs and need for appropriations, it is likely that the full appropriations will not be required. Although this is the Committee's goal, we still recommend you allocate sufficient program funds until a solution is reached. Anything less would risk another shut down or cap on the program and would constrict small business growth, which is vital for the nation's economic growth and job creation."" 
   Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Program: ""The SBDC Program is the SBA's largest and most extensive technical assistance program. With more than 11,000 service delivery points nationwide the SBDC Program serves more clients than all other SBA programs combined. The program provided more than 2 million training hours to almost 700,000 clients and helped to create or retain over 146,000 jobs in FY 2003. 
   ""The Administration's budget request for FY 2005 of $88 million is $1 million less than was appropriated for FY 2003 and FY 2004. This amount fails to adequately account for the current state of the economy. Specifically, studies have consistently shown that when people are unable to find jobs, they turn to entrepreneurship, and when people consider entrepreneurship, they turn to their local SBDC for assistance. Given that SBDC services continue to produce impressive results and benefit hundreds of thousands of small businesses, Snowe recommend that SBDC funding for FY 2005 be increased to $93 million at a minimum. 
   U.S. Export Assistance Centers: ""The U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) are one-stop shops that provide small to medium sized businesses with local export assistance through a partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The SBAis the only partner in the USEAC that offers loans that are geared toward small businesses developing or expanding in the export market. The SBA proposes to eliminate the USEAC line item in FY 2005, thereby terminating the SBA's involvement in the program."" Noting the importance of small business exports to this nation's economic growth and creation of jobs, and the valuable assistance that USEACs provide to exporters, Snowe recommend the continued funding of the USEAC Program at $5 million. 
   Microloan Program: ""The SBA has stated that the Microloan Program should be terminated and the loans under this program should be approved through the 7(a) Program. However, the Microloan Program is designed to support the needs of very small businesses and self-employed entrepreneurs that have insufficient credit profiles to qualify for 7(a) loans. This point was clearly emphasized at the Senate Small Business Committee's hearing on February 12, 2004, that if the Microloan Program is terminated, these borrowers will find it difficult to secure financing to fund their new or established small businesses. 
   ""The Microloan Program is an important source of financing for entrepreneurs who are not yet considered bankable in the private sector lending community and have no other available option. Therefore, the Microloan Program should be funded at FY 2004 levels at $1.91 million and the Microloan Technical Assistance Program at $15 million."" 
   Federal and State Technology Partnership (FAST): ""Technological innovation creates jobs, improves our way of life, and helps American companies maintain their competitive advantage over foreign firms. To capitalize on the small business sector's innovative potential, Congress created the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, which directs federal research and development grants to small businesses. Congress later created the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program to further utilize the innovative potential of the small business sector. Currently, these programs facilitate over $1.5 billion in government research and development grants to small businesses. Moreover, since the inception of the program in 1982, SBIR firms have produced more than 4,100 patents."" Therefore, Snowe requested that the FAST Program be funded at $2 million in FY 2005, which is consistent with FY 2004 funding. 
   Rural Outreach. ""The Rural Outreach Program (ROP) provides funding to stimulate greater participation in the SBIR and STTR programs by small firms in rural states with low participation rates. The program benefits small businesses that receive assistance as well as the federal government and the economy because these grants result in better and higher-quality research and development proposals, which are more likely to produce valuable innovations. We recommend that the ROP be funded at $250,000 for FY 2005."" 
   SCORE. ""A volunteer-based small business assistance network SCORE is both cost efficient and effective. With its reliance on a cadre of approximately 10,500 experienced volunteers, SCORE provides expert training to entrepreneurs and small business owners each year at a low or no-cost - and at a fraction of the market value for such services. Under current appropriations, the SCORE Program is unable to expand and update its scope of services."" Therefore, Snowe recommend that the SCORE funding for FY 2005 be increased to $7 million so that SCORE can expand into new sectors of the economy. 
   HUBZone (Historically Underutilized Business Zone) Program: ""According to the SBA, in FY 2003, each $1 spent on the HUBZone Program yielded a return of $432 in contract awards and helped to create more than 18,000 jobs in the U.S., approximately 70 percent of which were located in distressed areas. Yet, inconsistent funding hampers the ability of the program to achieve its goals."" 
   In FY 2002, an unexpected omission in the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill deleted the HUBZone Program funding, although in the Defense Supplemental Appropriations bill the Congress subsequently directed that HUBZone funding be restored through a reprogramming request. In FY 2003, the Conference Committee on the FY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Act once again zeroed out program funding, but in FY 2004, the program was appropriated $2 million. 
   This year, the SBA has not requested a separate line item for the HUBZone Program, but instead has committed to fund the program as part of the overall Government Contracting/Business Development (GC/BD) Program budget. Snowe requested the appropriators clearly state in report language that $10 million be earmarked from the overall GC/BD Program budget for the HUBZone Program. 
   Procurement Center Representatives (PCRs): ""PCRs work with federal agencies to increase small business opportunities in the federal acquisition process by reviewing agency acquisition plans and making appropriate recommendations to set aside opportunities for small business. However, the number of PCRs has shrunk in the last several years, draining the SBA of valuable procurement knowledge and experience, and diminishing the agency's ability to meet its statutory mandate. 
   ""Therefore, we ask that you allocate $5 million to hire and train an additional 25 PCRs in FY 2005, while replacing attrition among existing PCRs, and include specific language in accompanying reports that clearly states the purpose for which this funding is provided.""

   The JOBS Act will allow the U.S. to meet its obligations to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by repealing the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion and converting the incentive into a broad-based manufacturing tax exemption that would effectively lower manufacturers' tax rates by 3 percent - from a top rate of 35 percent to 32 percent. The bill would redistribute the $50 billion planned for FSC/ETI over the next ten years to a much wider range of manufacturers. 
   ""Today, the Senate passed critical legislation that will help our economy grow and provided critical jobs to those who need them,"" said Snowe. ""With the World Trade Organization ruling that the United States is in violation of international trade law, the JOBS bill has brought our nation into compliance, and will help level the playing field for our nation's manufacturers to compete in the global marketplace. This legislation also provides much needed tax relief to our nation's manufacturers at a time when our nation is on the road to recovery."" 
   On March 1 of this year, the European Union (EU) began the process of imposing up to $4 billion in sanctions on American manufacturers because of the rules governing Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI). The WTO found that these rules provide an illegal trade subsidy that violates international trade law. The JOBS Act repeals these rules bringing the US in compliance with international trade law, removing these hurtful sanctions. This legislation also replaces tax relief provided under the FSC/ETI rules with what amounts to a three-percent income tax rate reduction for domestic manufacturers with income from their domestic manufacturing activity. Importantly, this tax relief would be available to ALL manufacturers, regardless of size, meaning that S-corporations, sole proprietorships, and partnerships are all eligible for this tax relief. 
   Snowe highlighted the overall impact on Maine: ""While recent economic indicators are indeed heartening, over the past several years no industry has witnessed a more profound erosion of jobs than U.S. manufacturers. In my home state of Maine, 17,300 manufacturing jobs have been lost in just three years. So we are exactly right to focus on strengthening this vital sector that has also been traditionally a source of quality jobs, decent wages and critical benefits,"" said Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee and Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. 
   When fully phased-in, the bill would provide a 9 percent tax deduction for income that is attributable to domestic production activities. Under a measure requested by Senator Snowe, the benefits of the new manufacturing deduction will be extended to S corporations. The bill also extends this tax relief to partnerships and sole proprietorships. 
   ""With small businesses accounting for 97.5 percent of Maine businesses, 98 percent of America's manufacturing enterprises, and contributing three-quarters of all new jobs nationwide, whatever we do should continue this trend and reinvigorate America's entrepreneurial spirit."" said Snowe. ""This legislation does not just focus on tax policy to help U.S. companies, but also fosters the creation of jobs."" 
   To that end, there are several provisions that Snowe, as a member of the powerful Finance Committee, successfully worked to have included in the JOBS Act: 
   Shipbuilding 
   * Method of Accounting for Naval Shipbuilders - A Snowe provision is included that would delay, but not reduce the amount of tax a builder of a naval ship pays on profits earned upon delivery of each ship, provided the construction or overhaul takes two years or longer. Currently, Naval shipbuilders are required to pay tax on a percentage of their expected profits even though a ship being constructed may yet not be completed and payment not received until a future date. This tax treatment is similar to how commercial shipbuilders pay their income tax. 
   ""By changing the way our nation's naval shipbuilders account for their tax payments, this will strengthen the industry's overall financial health and ultimately our national security,"" said Snowe. ""Currently, our naval shipbuilders at facilities like Bath Iron Works in Maine, are forced to pay income tax much earlier than when they receive payments for the ship. This is not only unfair, but has the potential to negatively impact their cash flow and their long-term financial health."" 
   ""This provision takes dramatic steps to remedy this inequity by changing the timing in which these taxes are due,"" said Snowe. ""By no means does this provision lower the tax rate for our shipbuilders - in fact it is exactly the same over time - but rather makes it a more balanced and reasonable approach."" 
   Small Business Assistance 
   * Expansion of Section 179 Expensing - Currently, small businesses may expense $100,000 of the cost for new equipment and other property. This benefit is phased-out for companies that make over $400,000 in a year in qualified investments. This provision would increase the $400,000 phase-out amount to $800,000, which would allow more companies to qualify for section 179 expensing. 
   * Modification of the Unrelated Business Taxable Income Rules - This provision based on an amendment Snowe offered, excludes government-guaranteed debt capital of Debenture Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) from the definition of ""debt"" for purposes of the unrelated business taxable income (UBIT) rules. This would encourage pension funds and other tax exempt organizations to invest in SBICs, which will then have the additional capital to invest in small businesses. 
   Forest Products Industry 
   * Based on another Snowe-sponsored amendment, companies will be allowed to write off the first $10,000 of their reforestation expenses, and allows them to amortize their remaining costs over 7 years. 
   * Unprocessed Softwood - The tax deduction for manufacturers in the original proposed bill would not apply to ""unprocessed softwood timber"". This is a holdover from the FSC/ETI rules that were based on export sales. Since the new tax deduction for manufacturers is not based on exports, Senator Snowe had a provision included that would allow ""unprocessed softwood timber"" to qualify for the manufacturers tax deduction, an important addition for Maine. 
   Energy 
   * Snowe also supported an amendment offered by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and Craig Thomas (R-WY) that is similar to legislation she introduced last September that allows a 15 year applicable recovery period for depreciation of electric transmission property. Snowe proposed the legislation in the wake of last summer's costly blackouts in the Northeast.

ROCKEFELLER DEMANDS THAT CHINA PLAY FAIR ON TRADE
  With joint trade talks set to begin tomorrow between the United States and China, Sen. Jay Rockefeller and a bi-partisan group of 16 U.S. Senators are calling for the Chinese government to commit to a series of changes that would make trade fairer between the two countries. Under an artificially-devalued currency, Chinese companies are able to sell goods at lower prices, creating a $200 billion trade deficit - the largest in world history - for the U.S. Senators also want the Chinese to stop crippling the American music industry and open its markets to U.S. beef. 
   Administration officials will meet Tuesday with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi in a daylong meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade - the forum for the U.S.-China talks.
   ""Our economic relationship is now at a critical point and failure by China to address key outstanding trade concerns and fulfill longstanding commitments creates the risk of serious damage,"" Rockefeller and the Senators wrote the Vice Premier.
   Among the areas where the Senators demanded the Chinese make meaningful commitments to fairer trade include:
   Halting the pirating of American music and other infringements of American intellectual property.
   Lifting China's ban on U.S. beef, a ban inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules and regulations.
   Reduce government intervention in the marketplace.
   Increasing the flexibility of the yuan - a move that is not only more responsive to true market forces, but would enable American companies to compete with Chinese companies.
   ""We look to your leadership to help resolve serious problems that face our trade and economic relationship - symbolized by the record $200 billion trade deficit that the United States posted last year with China, the largest deficit between any two countries in history,"" Rockefeller and the Senators wrote. ""It was obvious at last week's Senate Finance Committee hearing that serious questions exist regarding the value of China's currency and China's compliance with its commitments in the World Trade Organization.""
   Rockefeller is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees U.S. trade policy.

ROCKEFELLER VOTES IN FAVOR OF FORECLOSURE RELIEF LEGISLATION
  Over the objections of President Bush, and in an effort to address the growing home foreclosure crisis, the U.S. Senate has passed legislation cosponsored by Senator Jay Rockefeller aimed at helping West Virginia families and veterans stay in their homes and rebuild neighborhoods that have a surplus of vacant property. The Foreclosure Prevention Act passed the U.S. Senate today by a vote of 84-12. 
    ""The legislation that we passed today has the potential to bring some real peace of mind to those West Virginia families that are struggling each month to keep a roof over their heads,"" Rockefeller said. ""Our nation is in the grips of a crippling housing crisis, and the dream of homeownership should never turn into a nightmare of unpredictable interest rates and declining property values.""
   To keep struggling families in their homes, the Foreclosure Prevention Act provides additional federal funding for housing counselors, offers new options for homeowners to refinance out of subprime loans, and allows returning veterans more time to make mortgage payments and one-year relief from increases in mortgage interest rates. 
   President Bush has objected to a part of the bill that would provide billions of dollars in additional funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). States and local communities would be able to use CDBG funds to purchase foreclosed homes from lenders that can be resold or leased to families. By reducing the number of vacant homes in a neighborhood, existing homeowners will see their property values remain the same or increase. 
   ""In the midst of a recession, the President applauds the Federal Reserve's decision to spend $30 billion to shore-up failing businesses on Wall Street. But ultimately that expense is going to be passed on the taxpayer and grow our national debt,"" Rockefeller said. ""Rather than criticize congressional efforts to rebuild our communities, improve property values, and keep families and veterans in their homes, the President should be working with us."" 
   The bill also takes a number of steps to prevent a future mortgage crisis by improving the disclosure of information given to borrowers when they receive a mortgage or refinance, enabling them to make better, more informed decisions about their loans.
   The Foreclosure Prevention Act includes a number of important tax relief provisions aimed at jump-starting the ailing housing market. These include: a federal standard property tax deduction for West Virginia homeowners who don't itemize; increased bond authority to allow municipalities to refinance subprime loans and provide mortgages for first-time homebuyers and multifamily rental housing; an extension of the Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryback to help aid homebuilders and businesses hit hardest by the economic slump; and a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of homes already in foreclosure.
   The Foreclosure Prevention Act now moves to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration. Senator Rockefeller, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, is an original cosponsor of the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.

  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement in response to comments made by President Bush earlier this afternoon on reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Senator Rockefeller co-authored the legislation that created CHIP in 1997. Earlier this year, he submitted legislation that would reauthorize that program for another 5 years.  
   ""It's no surprise to anyone that our nation's health care system is broken. But, whatever your view is on how best to reform the system, I believe that one thing is perfectly clear - our children should come first and their healthcare must be protected. 
   ""For a decade, CHIP has succeeded in meeting the health care needs of millions of children. Through the CHIP program, states are provided with the resources they need to take care of one of our most vulnerable populations. As a result, millions of children have received routine healthcare checkups, immunizations, and screenings to give kids a healthy start in life. You can't duplicate that kind of security through the tax code, despite the President's wishful thinking. 
   ""It's time for the President to get serious about children's health care and work with Congress to give families the peace of mind that they deserve.""

ROCKEFELLER SUPPORTS REAUTHORIZATION OF WELFARE REFORM
  To build on the historic 1996 welfare reform, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is supporting a Senate Finance Committee welfare reauthorization bill that would continue to help families move from welfare to work. The PRIDE (Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone) bill reauthorizes the welfare reform law that fundamentally transformed the old system of dependency into a new program focused on moving families into jobs and self-sufficiency. An essential part of this transition to work for many individuals and families is child care, and the bill Rockefeller supports adds $6 billion in new child care funding over the next five years, including $30 million for West Virginia. 
   ""Child care is critical for families moving from welfare to work. Having access to safe, reliable child care is often the difference between being able to enter the workforce or not,"" said Rockefeller. ""This bill makes important investments in child care."" 
   The PRIDE bill helps West Virginia individuals and families move into the workplace in other ways. The bi-partisan bill continues special work rules for mothers with children under 6, so that they have a more flexible 24-hour per week work requirement. The House Republican welfare bill would eliminate the special work rules for mothers with young children and impose a 40 hours work requirement on all parents. 
   The bill also helps move people off the welfare rolls by: 
   * Authorizing $100 million for job creation and job placement programs. 
   * Creating a Parents as Scholars program, allowing up to 10% of recipients to attend college.
   * Expanding Transitional Medicaid Assistance from 1 year to 2 years.
   * Providing publicly-available research on children's well-being data for West Virginia and al l states. 
   * Strengthening child support enforcement to encourage states to give families more of the money collected from non-custodial parents so that families can leave welfare.
   In the 107th Congress, Rockefeller was a leader in welfare reform efforts that supported these ideas, and throughout his career he has been recognized as a leader on welfare reform. During negotiations on President Clinton's landmark 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, Rockefeller served as one of the Senate conferees.

ROCKEFELLER KICKS OFF 'COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK'
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), a nationally recognized leader on health care issues, was invited to deliver remarks at an event to rally awareness for 'Cover the Uninsured Week' Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Rockefeller addressed the need to set aside political differences and work to make certain that uninsured Americans have access to health care.  
   ""An estimated 18,000 people die every year in America because they lack health coverage. That is a very unflattering statistic for a world superpower. It's unnecessary and I'm sure most Americans find it unacceptable,"" Rockefeller said. ""I will continue to fight to make sure every American can get the basic medical treatment they need when they need it."" 
   During the May 10-16 'Cover the Uninsured Week,' nearly 1,500 organized events will take place in communities nationwide, including health and enrollment fairs, seminars for small business owners on how to obtain health coverage for their employees, campus discussions and interfaith events held in places of worship. 
   Rockefeller supported this week's activities by saying, ""We must do whatever we can to get more people covered. We cannot allow so many of our fellow citizens to just fall through the cracks of a deficient health care system."" 
   Rockefeller has a long history of working to obtain health coverage for the nearly 44 million Americans - including 241,700 West Virginians - that do not have health insurance. Rockefeller chaired the Pepper Commission in the late 1980s, which produced bipartisan recommendations on how to achieve universal coverage for both acute and long-term care. He also served on the Children's Commission in the early 1990s, and helped create a bipartisan report with recommendations on how to improve the lives and health coverage of America's children. Additionally, Rockefeller co-authored the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997, which insured 35,000 West Virginian children in 2003 alone. 
   ""We need to get back to higher ground in our discussions about the uninsured,"" Rockefeller said in his speech. ""We need to put aside our allegiance to party, ideology, special interest groups - and put the needs of the uninsured uppermost in our minds. We've done this before, and we can do it again."" 
   Rockefeller is the Chairman of the Alliance for Health Reform, which he founded in 1991 to encourage bipartisan solutions to the problems of the uninsured. Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), Vice-Chairman of the Alliance, also spoke at the event as well as television actor Noah Wyle, who is the volunteer spokesperson for 'Cover the Uninsured Week.'

ROCKEFELLER FAA BILL STRENGTHENS WEST VIRGINIA AVIATION SERVICES
  West Virginia's air transportation industry will benefit under bipartisan legislation co-authored by Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Trent Lott (R-MS) and introduced last week. The Aviation Investment and Modernization (AIM) Act of 2007 will continue to provide essential air service to local communities, invest in airport safety and capacity improvements, restore air traffic controllers' bargaining rights, and establish a national research center to fund coal to jet fuel research.
   Senator Rockefeller, Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee on Commerce, said ""a healthy and modern aviation system is vital to the economic future of countless small and local communities that are linked to the rest of the nation and world through aviation.""  
   ""In West Virginia alone, aviation represents approximately $3.4 billion of the state's gross domestic product, and directly and indirectly employs over 51,000 people,"" Rockefeller said. ""This bill is good for West Virginia and good for the nation."" 
   IMPROVING WEST VIRGINIA AIR SERVICE 
   Experts predict that the current air traffic control system is incapable of handling increased capacity. As a result, by 2015 gridlock in the skies and on the runways will become so bad that its effects will be felt throughout the system - especially at West Virginia's regional airports. Rockefeller said modernization of the system has to be a top priority. 
   ""Given the nature of our aviation system, delays on the runways at O'Hare or Charlotte will be felt by travelers in West Virginia. When congestion increases, small communities are the first to lose flights or service. We must modernize air traffic control systems and build new runways in order to keep commerce and people moving everywhere,"" Rockefeller said. ""The only way to pay for these improvements is to spread the cost fairly among all users of the system."" 
   In order to make the costs more fair, funds will come from a new $25 surcharge for commercial and ""high-end"" general aviation users, such as corporate jets. It's predicted that the new surcharge will generate close to $400 million in revenue over the next four years. These funds would be dedicated to implementing the ""Next Generation Air Traffic Control System"" - the program to replace the existing analog communication system with a state-of-the-art digital system. 
   In addition to modernization, the Rockefeller-Lott bill provides $35 million for the Small Community Air Service Development Program and $133 million to the Essential Air Service program - five West Virginia communities receive approximately $5 million in EAS subsidies annually. 
   Earlier this year, the Bush Administration offered a proposal that would have reduced funding for Airport Improvement Programs (AIP) at 15 of the 17 general aviation airports within West Virginia. Under the AIM act, funding for those airports is restored and greater flexibility is given to facilities to decide how best to spend those funds. The Rockefeller bill continues the AIP cost-sharing formula - 95% federal and 5% local match - for airport projects he first helped to establish in 2003. 
   PROTECTING GENERAL AVIATION 
   Under the Rockefeller-Lott bill, ninety percent of West Virginia's general aviation community will continue to pay the current rate - they will not be subject to the new surcharge or a proposed increase in jet fuel taxes. 
   Unlike the Bush Administration proposal, the Rockefeller-Lott bill does not include a host of user fees for aircraft certification that would have adversely impacted aircraft manufacturers and general aviation. For instance, the Administration proposed increasing fuel taxes to as high as 70 cents on all general aviation users - adversely affecting the West Virginia general aviation community - while at the same time eliminating all taxes and fees on the commercial airlines. 
   In contrast, and in a separate recommendation for the Senate Finance Committee, where Senators Rockefeller and Lott both are senior members, they outlined a proposal that would bring equity to the current system of taxes and fees, where there has been a historical imbalance between the commercial and general aviation fields. 
   The Senators' plan retains existing taxes and fees paid by aviation users. However, over the next five years the 4.3 cents per gallon tax on fuel used by commercial airlines will be phased out. Fuel taxes on ""high-end"" jet aviation will be increased from 21.8 cents to 49.1 cents per gallon. The increase will not apply to piston-engined aircraft - which are flown by the vast majority of West Virginia's recreational fliers. 
   COAL TO JET FUEL RESEARCH 
   The AIM act also establishes a national center of excellence to develop coal to jet fuel technologies. Rockefeller noted that several countries around the world already use fuels derived from coal with great success - and the U.S. military has some projects underway, specifically, the Air Force is already testing the use of Appalachian coal-based jet fuels. 
   Other key provisions in the bill include: providing consumers with information on on-time arrivals and delays from the airline industry, conducting a study on aircraft cabin air quality, and restoring balance and fairness in the FAA labor negotiation process. 
   A hearing on the legislation is scheduled for next week.

  Facing a critical deadline in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations at the end of the month, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-West Virginia) and Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) called upon the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Portman, to pursue a strong and comprehensive negotiating strategy that will protect American jobs from unfair and illegal foreign trade practices such as dumping and illegal subsidies. 
   In a letter sent this week to Ambassador Portman, Rockefeller and Craig, who were joined by 12 of their Senate colleagues, expressed their concern over the lack of proposals advocated by U.S. negotiators during the Doha Round of negotiations, currently underway in Geneva. The Senators also called upon Portman to follow the clear position of the U.S. Senate and take a tougher stance during the trade talks to protect American interests. The Senate unanimously accepted an amendment by Craig and Rockefeller in November that expressed the sense of Congress that our trade laws must not be undermined in the current round of negotiations.
   America's trade rivals have, so far, dominated the negotiations and have offered approximately 180 proposals that are detrimental to the U.S. economy. The Senators are concerned that American negotiators will be unable to address many of the significant grievances that affect the U.S. economy if they fail to pursue a comprehensive negotiating strategy during the final weeks of negotiations.
   As the Senators wrote:
   ""The continued strength of the trade remedy laws is vital both to our ability to counteract unfair foreign competition and to the health of critical parts of the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
   ""We believe that a more comprehensive strategy is needed now in Geneva to makes sure that these important laws are preserved and enhanced. We are now literally down to the final weeks when the U.S. can change the dynamics of these talks - this means putting forward a meaningful, affirmative agenda, right now.""

ROCKEFELLER CONTINUES THE FIGHT TO COVER MORE WEST VIRGINIA CHILDREN THROUGH CHIP
  During a hearing of the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) took aim at a Bush Administration policy that is making it harder for states like West Virginia to provide health care to children through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 
   ""When it comes to reducing the number of uninsured children, states are on the frontlines for delivering comprehensive and affordable health care. They know what works best in their individual states and have developed innovative proposals for guaranteeing coverage for children,"" Rockefeller said.  
   ""That's why I'm so frustrated with the Bush Administration's August 17, 2007 directive that has placed an impossible mandate on states,"" Rockefeller said. ""In my judgment, its aim is simple: to make it virtually impossible for states like West Virginia to provide greater access to health insurance for children.""
   Senator Rockefeller, who co-authored the CHIP program, noted at the hearing that a cornerstone of the program has always been state flexibility. Moreover, at time of growing economic uncertainty, states are struggling to cover those working families who are in need of assistance. This is particularly true when employers are reducing private coverage because of increasing economic pressures. 
   West Virginia has enacted legislation to cover uninsured children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $52,800 a year for a family of three. The state phased in coverage to 220 percent of poverty in January 2007, but has not taken any further steps to implement the planned expansion because of questionable guidance from the Bush Administration known as the August 17 directive. As a result, our state is unable to move forward with its planned expansion of coverage, leaving at least 4,000 West Virginia children uninsured.
   Last year, on August 17, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a letter to states that were attempting to provide health insurance to more children through their CHIP programs. The so-called August 17 directive effectively mandated that any state trying to enroll children in CHIP from families earning more than 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or $44,000 for a family of three, had to first be able to prove that they've covered 95 percent of children in families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level ($35,200 for a family of three). 
   ""The real reason that the Bush Administration crafted this onerous directive is because they knew that they weren't going to get their way during last year's CHIP reauthorization negotiations,"" Rockefeller said. ""With the stroke of a pen, and less than $100 in postage, the Administration has unleashed a tidal wave of financial uncertainty for states and families that will be measured in the loss of billions of dollars in state-aid, and hundreds of thousands of children being denied access to health insurance.""
   No other voluntary federal means-tested program - not the Medicare prescription drug program nor the food stamps program - has enrollment of 95 percent. In fact, only in Medicare Part B, where seniors are automatically enrolled unless they specifically opt-out, is there a higher than 95 percent participation rate (95.5 percent enrolled).
   To reverse this misguided policy, Senator Rockefeller has co-authored legislation that would postpone the implementation of the August 17 directive until April 2009. Additionally, the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act (S. 2819) will preserve access to Medicaid during the current recession by temporarily extending - through April 1, 2009 - the Medicaid moratoria on payments to public providers, graduate medical education, school-based services, and rehabilitative services that Congress has already enacted. 
    The legislation will also delay - through April 1, 2009 - implementation of the following additional Medicaid regulations, which are already in effect or scheduled to go into effect in the near future: targeted case management, allowable provider taxes, outpatient clinic and hospital services, and the Departmental Appeals Board rule. 
   The Economic Recovery in Health Care Act is pending before the Senate Finance Committee, where Rockefeller serves as a senior member.

This investment is critical because students with access to technology will be the high-tech workers of tomorrow.""
   The West Virginia institutions receiving the computers are the Wirt County High School in Elizabeth, the Mingo County Schools, the Calhoun County Schools, the McDowell County Schools, and the Pendelton County Schools. 
   The computers, which were divided equally among the five recipients, were made available through the Senate's Computers for Schools Program. Senate officials established the program to help public schools take advantage of information technology by providing them with surplus computers.
   Rockefeller has been recognized nationally for his education technology work. Technology & Learning recently honored Rockefeller and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) as part of the ""5 That Made Their Mark"" for their creation of the landmark 1996 E-Rate program, which over the last decade has provided Internet connections to tens of thousands of American schools and libraries.

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES WHITE HOUSE, PENTAGON TO SAVE LOCKHEED MARTIN JOBS IN CLARKSBURG
  To ensure that the U.S. military has maximum transport capability and to protect West Virginia jobs, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) joined 18 other Senators today in a bi-partisan letter to President George W. Bush, urging reconsideration of plans to end the C-130J contract in the FY2006 budget. Approximately 80 jobs at Lockheed Martin's Clarksburg plant depend on completing the multi-year contract for 62 C-130J planes. 
   ""At a time when we are trying to improve the readiness and effectiveness of our military forces, eliminating the C-130J contract doesn't make sense,"" Rockefeller said. ""The C-130 transport plane has been reliable, but military modernization is an ongoing process. We need a new version of this proven aircraft. The C-130J will provide that.
   ""The President should realize that eliminating the C-130J could harm our nation's defense - and hurt West Virginia workers, as well as American workers elsewhere. The White House should reconsider the Pentagon decision.""
   Workers at Clarksburg's Lockheed Martin plant build components for the C-130J, an updated version of the C-130. The C-130 transport plane has been the workhorse of the military fleet for more than 50 years, but is aging. Currently, more than half of the C-130 fleet is 30 years old or older. Without the C-130J, the Air Force will be 116 aircraft short of meeting modernization requirements, and the Marine Corps will be 18 aircraft short. 
   Reports suggest that canceling the C-130J program will result in savings of $26 million next year. But without the new planes, the military will spend over $800 million in termination liability costs and millions of dollars in increased costs to maintain outdated aircraft. As a result, the proposal to end the C-130J program could end up costing American taxpayers far more than the cost of completing the contract for the C-130Js - besides the costs of lost jobs.
   West Virginia Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) also signed the letter.

ROCKEFELLER, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS CALL FOR SERIES OF HEARINGS ON COAL MINE SAFETY
  Following last week's tragic mining accident at Sago, West Virginia, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), along with a bipartisan group of eleven Coal State Senators, today requested the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee to hold a series of hearings specifically dedicated to the issue of coal mine safety. Congress has conducted no comprehensive oversight hearings of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) since 2001. During that period, which has seen more than 100 deaths in mine workplace accidents, MSHA has struggled with severe budget cuts and a wave of planned retirements. Among other issues, Rockefeller and his colleagues want the hearings to address MSHA funding, the crisis in the number of MSHA inspectors, and the shortage of mine rescue units. 
   ""This last week has been a real wakeup call for people all over America that we need to do more - much more - to take care of those people who on a daily basis are risking their lives to bring electricity to our homes, schools, and businesses,"" Rockefeller said. ""We need to know why the administration thinks that it can carry out a policy where it is committing fewer and fewer resources to meet an industry that has more and more needs. 
   ""We need congressional hearings not only so that we can determine what happened at Sago, but, more broadly, about the state of mine safety across West Virginia and across the country. Coal is on the rise in our country and safety must be too."" 
   In their letter to HELP Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Ranking Democratic Member Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), the Senators wrote, ""We make this request while the tragedy of last week's Sago Mine disaster is fresh in the minds and hearts of us all. We know that miners, retirees, and their families throughout the country are well aware of the risks inherent in working in even the safest mines, but we must work to minimize those risks so that such a tragedy never occurs again. For those of us from coal mining states, and for the people we represent, these twelve miners lost in Upshur County, West Virginia are very much tragedies in our own communities. We know too that all Americans who followed this unfolding catastrophe join us in seeking answers, and in wanting Congress to act in a bipartisan fashion to prevent similar calamities in the future.
   ""Each of us looks forward to the opportunity to work together with the Chairman and Ranking Member to improve mine safety. We anxiously await and will closely monitor the MSHA investigation at Sago Mine. At the same time, with demand for coal increasing, we hope with the cooperation of the HELP Committee and experts from government, industry, labor, and worker safety organizations, to develop policies to benefit the entire coal mining community. We look forward to sending strong, bipartisan mine safety legislation to the President for his signature before the end of the year. The miners who died at Sago deserve no less."" 
   During four of the last five years, the administration has called for a reduction in the MSHA budget. According to one report, the cuts have led to the loss of 170 inspectors, even though demand for coal is growing. By the end of FY 2007, a full 25 percent of the MSHA inspector workforce will have retired. 
   Rockefeller has also talked with several of his Senate colleagues about traveling with him to Sago to learn more about the situation in West Virginia. 
   Signing Rockefeller's letter were Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV), Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA), Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL), Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN), Senator Barack Obama (D-IL), Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY), Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN).

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES FOR AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR WEST VIRGINIA SENIORS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who has long fought to lower the cost of prescription drugs, today pushed for the Medicare prescription drug program to be able to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Sen. Rockefeller noted the importance of price negotiation for seniors, particularly those on fixed incomes.   
   ""For the seniors in West Virginia, prescription drug affordability is not a political issue, it is an issue of survival,"" said Rockefeller. ""And for many seniors in our state, especially those who struggle financially, Medicare's current prescription drug program is simply not meeting their needs."" 
   Current Medicare law expressly prohibits the federal government from negotiating with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices, and Senator Rockefeller believes that the federal government should have the opportunity to get the best deal possible for seniors.  
   ""The 43 million people who participate in the Medicare program depend on the federal government to seek the lowest prices possible and to get the most for their hard-earned dollars,"" Rockefeller said.  
   Senator Rockefeller, the new Chairman of the Finance Health Care Subcommittee, has been a long-time advocate of protecting seniors from high prescription drug costs. He believes that government price negotiation will be an important tool in reducing overall costs.  
   ""Price negotiation has been enormously successful for the Department of Veterans Affairs and state Medicaid programs,"" said Rockefeller. ""And if price negotiation can help to shield our seniors from the costs they struggle to pay, then we must do everything in our power to help them.""

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES FOR MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THAT WOULD AFFECT 133,000 WEST VIRGINIA WORKERS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller today called on the Senate to pass a minimum wage increase bill that would immediately benefit 59,000 West Virginia workers who currently earn the minimum wage. The bill would affect a total of 133,000 workers in the state when fully phased-in in two years. A long-time champion for working West Virginians, Sen. Rockefeller underscored the significant impact an increase would have.   
   ""Raising the minimum wage would have an enormous effect in West Virginia,"" said Rockefeller. ""For many of these workers, who are the primary breadwinners in their families, this would truly mean a better quality of life."" 
   Senator Rockefeller attended a committee hearing yesterday that reviewed the impact of increasing the minimum wage, and possible tax benefits to help offset any adverse effects on small businesses.  
   ""Raising the minimum wage is terribly important - and we have to get it done,"" said Rockefeller. ""We may also be able to provide small businesses with some assistance to offset any potential effect of the increase."" 
   While the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour has not had an increase in nearly a decade, the House voted yesterday to raise the minimum wage incrementally to $7.25 an hour over the next two years. Senator Rockefeller has voted to increase the federal minimum wage at least eight times since 1998, and he plans to vote for it again when the issue comes up for debate in the Senate. 
   ""When the minimum wage was first enacted, the goal was to provide workers with wages on which they could live and support their families,"" said Rockefeller. ""Families simply cannot live on the current minimum wage - and now is the time for Congress to take action on an increase that is long overdue.""

   ""Being mentioned in the same list as technology giants Bill Gates and Steve Jobs is really an honor,"" said Rockefeller. ""Regardless of the particular direction we've taken to improve education technology, all of us have shared the same goal of advancing education technology because we know how important it is that our schools and libraries have the resources they need to educate our students and prepare them to compete for the jobs of the future. 
   ""E-Rate, in particular, has been a vital part of providing this gateway to technology, particularly in rural areas such as those that make up much of West Virginia. E-Rate has been the great equalizer. It has made sure that, no matter where people live or what the resources of their school are, no child will be left behind."" 
   E-Rate provides deep discounts to schools and libraries in West Virginia and throughout the nation for telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections for the classroom. Its record has been remarkable. In 1994, only 3 percent of classrooms nationwide were online. Today, almost 90 percent of classrooms nationwide, including 85 percent in West Virginia, are wired to the Internet because of E-Rate funding.

SALAZAR PUSHES FOR SECURE BORDER
  As the Senate begins debate on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, Sen. Ken Salazar moved today to secure the border by supporting an amendment to criminalize the construction of unauthorized tunnels under U.S. borders.
   ""Our Nation's borders are broken and lawless. Even before September 11, Border Patrol agents discovered two underground tunnels used to transport illegal drugs across the border. Now, with the very real threats of terrorism and human trafficking looming large, reports of underground tunnels are troubling for law enforcement and humanitarian workers alike. Without a secure border, our National Security remains at risk,"" said Senator Salazar, a former Colorado Attorney General. 
   The ""Border Tunnel Prevention Act,"" which Senator Salazar cosponsored as an amendment today, punishes the construction of unauthorized tunnels with a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. In addition, the legislation punishes those who permit others to construct tunnels with a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.
   Also today, in a press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Senator Salazar emphasized that border security is an integral facet of any comprehensive approach to addressing illegal immigration and America's National Security. Senator Salazar noted that Democrats have offered a wide array of amendments that would have provided $3.4 billion in border security funds since 2001 and that the Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform act adds thousands of new personnel to help secure our porous borders. 
   ""Congress is ready to address this National Security issue,"" Senator Salazar said today. ""Hopefully, this week we can begin to address this issue in a reasonable and appropriate manner. Hopefully we can begin to bring law and order to our porous borders. Hopefully we can convince our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the National Security of the Nation is too important to play politics with.""
   Senator Salazar's complete remarks as prepared follow:
   ""Our Nation is embroiled in a debate of epic proportions - border security and the reality of illegal immigration. The reality is that our borders are broken and lawless. In the past two decades the number of undocumented immigrants living here has tripled to nearly 12 million.
   ""The fact that the federal government has permitted millions to cross our borders illegally, with no idea who is entering and for what purpose, is unacceptable. Enforcement of our immigration laws has not kept pace with the flow of both legal and illegal immigration, and laws that deal with those who crossed the border are rarely enforced.
   ""There has been a lot of tough talk of late about fixing our broken borders; unfortunately talking about the problem for political gain won't fix anything.
   ""Since 2001, the number of illegal border crossers apprehended annually has dropped 30 percent. The 9/11 Act authorized new facilities to hold an additional 8,000 individuals detained for illegally crossing our border each year for the next five years. In contrast, in FY06, Congress funded only 1,800 additional detention beds. Today, our border control agents can only handle 10 percent of illegal border crossers under current staffing conditions.
   ""The 9/11 Act also mandated an additional 800 immigration enforcement agents for each of the next five years. For Fiscal Year 2006, Congress funded only 350 additional agents. And again, in next year's budget, the Administration funds 85 fewer agents than authorized. 
   ""The GAO released a report in March that detailed how two federal investigators were able to smuggle enough nuclear material to make two dirty bombs across our northern and southern borders. The report stated that GAO investigators 'transported radioactive sources across both borders?with ease.' 
   ""While House Republican leadership mulls over politically-motivated hearings in swing districts, the rest of us are seeking a solution. 
   ""Since 9/11, Democrats have proposed amendments and legislative initiatives that would have provided an additional $3.4 billion in border security funds.
   ""The comprehensive immigration reform backed by a bipartisan majority of Senators includes hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of new positions aimed at fixing our lawless borders. For example, that bill would add 12,000 new Border Patrol agents, 10,000 new ICE worksite inspectors, 2,500 new port-of-entry inspectors, 1,000 new document fraud inspectors, and hundreds of other positions. 
   ""Between proposals offered by Democrats in both chambers and comprehensive immigration reform which provides for border security and immigration law enforcement, Congress is ready to address this National Security issue. 
   ""Hopefully, this week we can begin to address this issue in a reasonable and appropriate manner. Hopefully we can begin to bring law and order to our porous borders. Hopefully we can convince our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the National Security of the Nation is too important to play politics with.""

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS AGAINST REPUBLICAN SMALL BUSINESS BILL
  The Senate today moved toward a vote on a Republican small business health coverage bill that would undermine state-enacted consumer protections for an estimated 393,000 West Virginians. The Republican bill would leave it up to insurance companies to determine what would be covered and would leave it up to the companies to set their own rates. Under that bill, West Virginians would likely see a reduction in access to essential health care services, including treatment for alcoholism, cervical cancer screening, colorectal screening, mammography screening, home health care, mental health services, well child care, and supplies for diabetics. 
   ""Providing greater access to health insurance for our small business owners and employees is absolutely critical,"" said Rockefeller. ""But we should do this in a way that actually helps small businesses and employees. The Republican bill would ignore critical protections that West Virginia has enacted at the state level. It would create a system that would keep West Virginians from getting many of the basic health care services that they need. Unfortunately, the bill that they're trying to pass would hurt the businesses and employees it is supposed to help."" 
   Rockefeller and most Democrats support another bill, the Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act, but Republicans have blocked efforts to bring this bill up for a vote. The bill's Small Employers Health Benefits Program (SEHBP) is modeled after the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which has offered more than eight million government employees and retirees a wide range of private health insurance choices for more than 40 years. SEHBP would give small business employees access to a comparable range of private health plans. 
   ""So many West Virginians have told me that, due to the high cost of insurance, their employers haven't been able to provide them with the coverage they need. Passing the Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act would mean that West Virginians will have access to high-quality, affordable health coverage. That's something that should be their right."" 
   The Rockefeller bill would also give tax credits to employers, so they could benefit from the advantages and protections available to group insurance purchasers. Under SEHBP, employers would receive an annual tax credit to defray part of the costs employers incur providing health insurance for low-wage workers - those who make $25,000 or less per year. The employer tax credit would be equal to 25 percent of employer costs for workers who are single, 30 percent for those employees who are either married or single with a child, and 35 percent for family policies. The wage limitation would be adjusted annually for inflation. 
   In addition, employers who cover more than 60 percent of a low-wage worker's health insurance premium would receive a bonus tax credit. The bonus would be equivalent to a 5 percent add-on per additional 10 percent of premium covered. If the employer covers an additional 20 percent of the premium, an additional 10 percent tax credit would be granted.

   Background
   On the first day that Senator Rockefeller learned about the NSA warrantless surveillance program in July 2003, he expressed concerns that the program raised complicated legal and technical questions that required the careful evaluation of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He continues to believe that all aspects of this warrantless program, or any related program, require a great deal of oversight, and that congressional oversight to date is wholly insufficient.
   Early this year, Senator Rockefeller pressed for the full Senate Intelligence Committee to conduct an objective, bipartisan review of the NSA program's legality and effectiveness. Senate Republicans blocked this effort and the Administration only agreed to brief 7 of the 15 members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

ROCKEFELLER DENOUNCES CORPORATE TAX BILL FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS, COMPANIES MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today opposed a corporate tax bill that began as an effort to help domestic manufacturing companies but ballooned into a giveaway for special interests and companies that have moved jobs overseas. Sen. Rockefeller voted for an earlier version of the bill when it included real relief for the American economy. But he refused to vote for the bill's final passage after a Republican-led conference committee eliminated key economic incentives that would have helped West Virginia workers and companies.  
   ""This bill is not the balanced package of tax incentives for manufacturing that I supported in the Senate bill,"" Rockefeller said. ""The final deal that the Republicans have put together has virtually nothing for struggling domestic manufacturers, while it provides billions of dollars in tax breaks for companies that moved jobs overseas.
   ""Right now, workers in my state are worried about being laid off, and we had an opportunity to help American companies and American workers,"" said Rockefeller. ""But this flawed bill actually does more to reward companies for moving jobs overseas than it does to help companies who are struggling to keep their American factories open."" 
   The bill:   
   * Provides Corporate Tax Holidays - Companies that have moved jobs overseas and kept profits offshore will now enjoy a $3.5 billion tax break. 
  * Promotes Outsourcing - The final bill ignores a provision in the Senate bill to prevent the federal government from outsourcing contracts to foreign workers. 
  * Refuses to Provide Relief to Guard and Reserves or their Employers - Republican leadership refused to include a provision that would have given employers a tax credit of up to $15,000 if they continue to pay their activated Guard and Reserve employees.  
   * Eliminates Help for Domestic Manufacturers - The final bill removes Rockefeller-supported measures included in the Senate bill that would have allowed struggling steel companies and manufacturers to reclaim taxes paid on previous earnings. 
   * Protects Tax Shelters - The final bill doesn't include $40 billion in tax loophole closures approved in the earlier Senate bill. Such loopholes include tax shelters used by Enron to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, and allowing companies to avoid taxes if they move their headquarters overseas. 
   * Drops Responsible Energy Initiatives - The bill dropped tax incentives to develop clean coal technologies and increase natural gas production in Appalachia. 
   * Undermines Captive Shippers - The bill's repeal of a 4.3 cent excise tax on railroads' diesel fuel rewards monopolistic practices at the expense of West Virginia captive industries. 
   * Eliminates Broadband Technology Tax Incentives - The final bill dropped a broadband tax incentive Rockefeller authored that would have encouraged the deployment of high-speed Internet access across the country.   
  * Undermines Overtime - The bill fails to roll back new Labor Department rules that essentially eliminate the right to overtime pay for an estimated 6 million workers.  
  ""My decision on whether to support this legislation came down to a very simple test. Will this bill help West Virginia manufactures and improve our state's economy?"" Rockefeller concluded, ""I cannot support this bill because it decidedly fails that test.""

ROCKEFELLER PRAISES SENATE EFFORT TO IMPROVE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS
  Within a few days of passing the most comprehensive intelligence community reform legislation in over 50 years, the Senate this weekend voted to overhaul the Senate congressional committees that have direct oversight of the intelligence and homeland security functions of the United States. 
   Senator Rockefeller, the Vice-Chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has been a strong supporter of congressional reform. This summer, after the 9/11 commission unveiled their recommendations dealing with reform of the intelligence community, the executive branch, and Congress, Sen. Rockefeller immediately called on Congress to address their own shortcomings.
   ""The 9/11 Commission rightfully understood that we couldn't drastically improve our national security if we didn't address shortcomings in both the executive branch and in Congress,"" Rockefeller said. ""There is no higher priority for government than national security, yet our congressional committees were structured in such a way that it hindered proper oversight. Today, we have made significant improvements to congressional oversight that will have a direct impact on the future security of the United States.""
   Key provisions included in Senate Resolution 445 - the Intelligence Committee Reform Resolution are: 
   CREATION OF A NEW SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE THAT IS COMBINED WITH THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. 
   * This new committee would have the responsibility for activities now within the jurisdiction of nine other committees, and the Governmental Affairs Committee will relinquish some responsibilities to other panels.
   SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES OVERSIGHT ON THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE.
   * Creates 2 new subcommittees:1) intelligence oversight under the full Senate Committee on Intelligence and 2) intelligence appropriations under the full Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   * Eliminates the current term limits of eight years for Intelligence Committee members. 
   * Streamlines the process for enacting intelligence legislation that is shared by several committees.

ROCKEFELLER TO ADDRESS SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA BROADBAND SUMMIT
  As part of his ongoing effort to bring advanced telecommunications to southern West Virginia and the entire Mountain State, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is addressing next Monday's Southern West Virginia Broadband Summit, which is being hosted by the Discover the REAL West Virginia Foundation. The summit will bring together business and technology leaders, economic development leaders, and local elected officials from all over southern West Virginia and the country. The summit will take place at the Resort at Glade Springs, which is near Beckley. 
   ""Just as electricity and telephone service once spread throughout America, we must make sure that the benefits of high-speed Internet access spread to every household and business in West Virginia,"" said Rockefeller. ""I hear from too many economic developers and businesses, particularly in southern West Virginia that the lack of broadband availability is hampering our chances for economic growth.  
   ""This isn't just a technology issue - it's an economic issue. If we can develop an extensive broadband network, we will see new companies, bringing new jobs, move in to take advantage of this new technology."" 
   Rockefeller's summit address will focus on what the economic impact of greater broadband access would be for southern West Virginia's economy. Senator Rockefeller will join Federal Communications Commissioner Michael Copps and Congressman Nick Joe Rahall in delivering remarks in the morning. Following the morning remarks, attendees will participate in panel discussions on rolling out broadband access to rural areas and the trend toward municipal broadband. 
   Larry Irving, President of Washington's Irving Information Group, will be the lunch speaker. Irving, who served for almost seven years as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, is an expert in providing strategic planning and market development services to telecommunications and information technology companies, non-profit organizations, and foundations. 
   America has fallen behind the world's developed countries, in terms of broadband availability and usage. A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development finds that the United States has dropped from tenth to twelfth in the world in percentage of broadband usage. According to the Consumer Advocate Division of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, only 85 percent of American homes have high-speed telecommunications availability. In West Virginia, only 75 percent of residents and businesses have access to broadband, a number that is significantly lower in southern West Virginia. 
   In his effort to remedy this problem, Rockefeller over the last six years has introduced legislation promoting the deployment of broadband to underserved areas. Under the Broadband Internet Access Act, companies that deploy broadband in rural and other underserved communities would receive enhanced tax benefits. 
   The BIAA provides a temporary, two-tiered tax incentive to stimulate new investment in this crucial infrastructure. It contains a 10 percent tax credit for investment in ""current-generation"" broadband infrastructure in rural and underserved areas. It also includes a 20 percent credit for ""next generation"" broadband investments in rural and residential areas. The incentive is technology neutral, making delivery of service - not the delivery medium - the factor for determining eligibility. Any broadband provider meeting the required ""bit rates"" is eligible, regardless of whether the service is provided over a telephone wire, cable modem, optical fiber, wireless device, satellite service, or some other form of technology.

ROCKEFELLER SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO SECURE OVER $11.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO IMPROVE WEST VIRGINIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE
  As part of their efforts to secure and rehabilitate the state's bridges and highways, Senator Rockefeller joined Senator Byrd in supporting an amendment that would provide over $11.5 million for West Virginia's infrastructure.  
   ""For far too long, this administration has neglected much of our growing infrastructure problems at home, leading to dangerous levels of deterioration across our country,"" said Rockefeller. 
   Rockefeller cosponsored an amendment to the Senate Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Bill that will provide $1 billion to improve our country's infrastructure. The amendment, which passed the Senate with a vote of 60-33, will increase federal bridge funding by nearly 20 percent - an historic increase. 
   ""The silver lining in the Minnesota bridge tragedy is that it has highlighted the dilapidated state of many of our nation's bridges and highways and the need to rehabilitate these critical throughways,"" Rockefeller continued. ""It's been decades since many of West Virginia's bridges were built and inadequate federal funding has prevented our state from keeping up with repairs. This federal funding is a big step in the right direction."" 
   The funds allocated in the THUD bill will be used for the replacement, rehabilitation, and maintenance of bridges. The West Virginia Department of Transportation will be able to allocate the funds based on its priority projects. 
   The bill must now be passed by the full Senate and conference with the House's version.

ROCKEFELLER COMMENDS HOMELAND SECURITY'S EFFORT TO FIX GAPS IN SECURITY FOR PRIVATE AIRCRAFT
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Chairman of the Aviation Operations, Safety and Security Subcommittee, today commended the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for their Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) aimed at requiring private aircraft to meet higher security requirements.  
   ""Over the last 6 years, we have taken significant steps to improve our aviation security, but unacceptable gaps remain. One area of known vulnerability is private aircraft flying in and out of the United States,"" Rockefeller said. ""We must be able to identify every person - pilot, crew and passenger - that boards every flight, including private and cargo planes. Until we can sufficiently track who is traveling in and out of the United States, we will not be as safe as we could be."" 
   Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Senator Rockefeller has been instrumental in passing legislation overhauling the nation's aviation security efforts. He is a co-author of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which led to the creation of the Transportation Security Administration. 
   Rockefeller also included several provisions in the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 which established a new pilot license system with a picture and biometric feature, and required DHS to provide information on individuals who may pose a threat to aircraft charter and rental companies. 
   The Department of Homeland Security's NPRM, Advanced Information on Private Aircraft Arriving and Departing the United States, expands existing regulations that will require pilots of private aircraft to provide electronic manifest data for all persons traveling onboard. It would also require private aircraft to provide this manifest information no less than 60 minutes prior to departure from or to a foreign port or place. 
   DHS also recently announced the new passenger pre-screening system (Secure Flight), which allows airlines to provide travelers names to be checked against terrorism watch lists. If DHS's proposed rule goes into affect, general aviation charter and rental companies would gain access to this same system.

  Senator Jay Rockefeller today met with top executives, including CEO Lou Schorsch, of Arcelor Mittal Steel to discuss their Weirton operations. At the conclusion of the meeting, Rockefeller called the discussion frank and direct.  
   ""I am very concerned about the recent events and future of Mittal's Weirton facility,"" said Rockefeller. ""Weirton is a steel mill town, built and shaped by the industry. However, the declining employment and lack of investment has had severe effects on the community."" 
   Rockefeller, who recently visited Weirton and met with community leaders to discuss Mittal and the area's economy, urged Arcelor Mittal to reinvest in the Weirton mill and fulfill their obligation to the workers and members of the community. 
   ""I encourage Mittal to reconsider the closing of the strip mill - its one of the more productive mills in Mittal's system,"" Rockefeller noted. ""It also remains in the interest of Mittal and the community to sell Weirton's usable assets when there are willing buyers."" 
   In addition, Rockefeller noted that a tremendous amount of developable land in Weirton is owned by Arcelor Mittal and the company should not ignore the local requests to allow development on this land when feasible. Arcelor Mittal has recently indicated a willingness to part with some of the land, which Rockefeller says is a ""good start."" 
   ""Mittal needs to accept responsibility and be a good corporate citizen - it has an obligation to the Weirton community, workers, and families."" Rockefeller concluded. 
   Rockefeller has closely monitored the situation to ensure that the interests of steel workers and their families are paramount in any business decision. Rockefeller, the Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, has worked tirelessly to advocate for the needs of the Northern Panhandle steel industry.

  Tonight, the Senate passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, legislation aimed at permanently strengthening and improving the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The legislation, which passed 68-29, now must be reconciled with the House-passed version of the bill. The following is Chairman Rockefeller's statement:  
   ""With the Senate passage of this bill we are one step closer to restoring critical checks and balances to the President's surveillance program. 
   ""This is a very good bill that achieves what we set out to accomplish - restore civil liberty protections through proper FISA court oversight, and allow for targeted surveillance of potential terrorists. 
   ""For the first time, we have expanded protections to U.S. persons no matter where they are in the world, and we increased the role of the FISA Court including court approval of minimization procedures to ensure that the identities and information of American's incidentally collected is omitted. 
   ""Unfortunately, much of the debate over this bill has focused on liability protection for telecommunication carriers, instead of the new civil liberties protections and oversight mechanisms that have been included. 
   ""We spent many months, under tense negotiations, to craft provisions that would modernize and strengthen FISA while protecting Americans right to privacy. That is what this bill will do, and that is why it should be passed and signed into law. 
   ""Anger over the President's warrantless surveillance is appropriate and the Administration should be held accountable. However, we should not hold the carriers hostage to years of litigation for stepping forward when the country asked for their help and providing assistance they believed to be legal and necessary. 
   ""The fact is, if we lose cooperation from these or other private companies, our national security will suffer.""

  Sen. Chuck Grassley, of Iowa; Sen. Patrick Leahy, of Vermont; and Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, of West Virginia; have sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking for a study of the competitive effects of the use of ""authorized"" generics.

Consequently, if the generic industry were to be less incentivized to produce such generic drugs to compete with name brand drugs, it is possible that fewer generic drugs would come to market and the prices for certain drugs would remain high for consumers.""
   ""Authorized"" generics are name brand drugs sold under the label of a generic drug.
   Here's a copy of the letter sent to the Federal Trade Commission.
   May 9, 2005
   Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras
  Federal Trade Commission
  600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20580
   Dear Chairman Majoras and Commissioners:
   It has come to our attention that the practice of ""authorized"" generic drugs may produce anti-competitive results and, thus, present an issue worthy of study by the Federal Trade Commission. 
   The amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, enacted as part of the Medicare Modernization Act (Title XI, PL 108-173), provide that, in general, a generic company that successfully challenges the patent of a name brand pharmaceutical company earns 180 days of marketing exclusivity on that generic drug. The legislation was designed to strengthen incentives for generic manufacturers to bring generic drugs quickly to market, and thus promote competition and lower prices for consumers. 
   We have heard concerns that the practice of ""authorized"" generics could have a negative impact on competition for both blockbuster and smaller drugs, because the generic industry would be less inclined to invest in their production. Consequently, if the generic industry were to be less incentivized to produce such generic drugs to compete with name brand drugs, it is possible that fewer generic drugs would come to market and the prices for certain drugs would remain high for consumers.
   We are interested in determining the short term and long term effects on competition of the practice of ""authorized"" generics. Consequently, we request, pursuant to ' 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that the Commission conduct a study on this issue. We ask that this study look into the short term competitive benefits of introduction of ""authorized"" generics during the 180 day market exclusivity period. We also ask that the study look into the long term impact of the practice of ""authorized"" generics on competition in the drug market and on the price of drugs, as well as on the viability of the generic drug industry. 
   If such a study were to prove unfeasible, we hope the FTC will be able to conduct a workshop on this issue in the near future. If you have any questions about this request, please feel free to contact Susan Davies of Senator Leahy's office, Rita Lari Jochum of Senator Grassley's office, or Jocelyn Moore of Senator Rockefeller's office. They can be reached at (202) 224-7703 (Sen. Leahy), (202) 224-5564 (Sen. Grassley), or (202) 224-6472 (Sen. Rockefeller), respectively.

ROCKEFELLER SAYS ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET CUTS WILL HURT VETERANS
  In a Senate Veterans' Affairs hearing on long-term care, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) said that he believes veterans are not receiving the long-term health care they deserve and have earned. Rockefeller, the senior Democrat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, said that $3 billion in proposed Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) cuts over 10 years, on top of $10 billion in proposed Medicaid cuts over the next 5 years, will leave veterans with no place to turn for long-term health care. 
   ""We have no long-term care policy at all,"" said Rockefeller of the administration's approach to veterans' health care. ""You either get it through Medicaid, which we're cutting, and these cuts last over ten years and are just getting worse.""
   Rockefeller also talked about what the VA cuts will mean for West Virginia veterans seeking care at a veterans home in Clarksburg that is under construction. The home, which Rockefeller fought for, is scheduled to open next year. Since the Civil War, the federal government has reimbursed state veterans homes for veterans who seek long-term care. Under the administration's budget this year, however, VA has proposed to pay only for service-connected veterans. Service-connected veterans represent only 20 percent of the veterans in State Veterans Homes nationwide.
   Referring to what is happening to veterans' health care, Rockefeller said, ""Put this Member down as someone who is very skeptical, very concerned, and very worried."" Rockefeller added that he would fight to reverse the cuts.

ROCKEFELLER APPLAUDS VA ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S CALL FOR $60 MILLION IN RESEARCH FOR GULF WAR VETERANS' ILLNESSES
  A congressional advocate for research on the unidentified illnesses affecting Gulf War veterans, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) welcomed a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) report released today calling for $60 million over the next four years to monitor the health of Gulf War veterans and their children. The report by the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses claims that these disorders should not necessarily be attributed to stress, as had been suggested by previous government studies. The findings of the report open the door to an understanding of these illnesses as the result of exposure to toxic substances.  
   ""This report represents an acknowledgement that Gulf War veterans may have been affected by exposure to toxic chemicals,"" said Rockefeller. ""In the name of those veterans who suffer, we must do more. We must make sure that we adequately fund research that will enable us to fully understand the effects of soldiers' exposure to neurotoxins. 
   ""In our effort to identify the real cause of these illnesses, we must also push the Department of Defense (DoD) to improve their information-sharing process with VA. We will be able to better understand these illnesses when DoD provides full disclosure about what toxins Gulf War soldiers may have been exposed to. 
   ""Going forward, we have a responsibility to apply the lessons learned from the Gulf War veterans to the personnel fighting the current war in Iraq. The reality is that we don't know what environmental hazards our troops may be exposed to in Iraq. In the coming years, many of these veterans may experience similar symptoms as those of our Gulf War veterans, and we need to be prepared to treat their illnesses quickly and accurately. 
   ""Our veterans have made great sacrifices to protect our country. We owe them not only our sincerest thanks, but the full range of medical resources they deserve."" 
   During his tenure as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee from 1993-2002, Senator Rockefeller led the effort to pressure DoD to acknowledge that Gulf War veterans were returning with serious illnesses. In 1995, he pushed VA to create a registry to track illnesses in veterans and their families. And in 1998, he helped pass the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act, which called for ongoing research into the effects of chemicals on soldiers and called for extending that research to include spouses and the children of veterans. Senator Rockefeller continues to be a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.

ROCKEFELLER, SMITH FIGHT TO PROTECT SENIORS AGAINST EXCESSIVE REPAYMENT DEMANDS
  Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller (D-WV) and Sen. Gordon H. Smith (R-OR) are calling for greater clarification from the two federal agencies that incorrectly billed seniors and individuals with disabilities for their Medicare prescription drug premiums over the last several months. Rockefeller, Ranking Member of the Senate's Health Care Subcommittee, and Smith, Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, shared their concern for the continued administrative errors that have resulted in seniors living on fixed incomes being saddled with payment of several months worth of Medicare prescription drug premiums all in a single month. 
   Many seniors who requested that their Medicare premiums be deducted from their Social Security checks when they enrolled have yet to see a reduction in their checks. Consequently, they are not being billed, their premium debt is mounting, and their prescription drug plans are not being paid. Likewise, many seniors who switched to higher-cost prescription drug plans are still having the lower premiums from their original plan withheld. They too face mounting premium debt. In both cases, the debt can be for as much as nine or ten months worth of premiums.  
   These premium withholding errors were among several ongoing Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) data exchange problems that were highlighted last month when the two agencies provided incorrect prescription drug premium refunds totaling $50 million to 231,000 Medicare participants. 
   ""It is unfair to ask seniors to bear the financial burden of correcting a problem that occurred because of administrative difficulties on the part of the government,"" wrote Rockefeller and Smith. Citing SSA's plan to ask for a lump-sum payment while CMS plans to ask for installments, Rockefeller and Smith wrote, ""There seems to be greater confusion - not less - between your two agencies regarding what will actually happen to seniors in these circumstances in October and November.""
   Rockefeller and Smith requested a ""detailed response regarding [the] agencies' plans for handling the premium withholds of seniors and individuals with disabilities who, by no fault of their own, have several months of outstanding premium underpayments.""
   The entire letter follows:
   September 11, 2006
   Dr. Mark McClellan, Administrator Commissioner JoAnne Barnhart
  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Social Security Administration
  Department of Health and Human Services 6401 Security Boulevard
  200 Independence Avenue, SW Baltimore, Maryland 21235
  Washington, DC 20201
   Dear Dr. McClellan and Commissioner Barnhart:
   We are writing to follow-up on last week's Finance Committee Members' meeting to discuss concerns related to withholding prescription drug premiums from Medicare beneficiaries' Social Security checks. While this meeting was informative, and we are pleased to know that you are working to resolve most of the premium withholding problems, there is an outstanding issue of significant consequence that requires prompt resolution. We specifically request that you provide us with a detailed response regarding your agencies' plans for handling the premium withholds of seniors and individuals with disabilities who, by no fault of their own, have several months of outstanding premium underpayments.
   As you both mentioned in the meeting, there are four main premium withhold issues that have been encountered by your agencies: 1) premium withholding not being stopped even though seniors have changed to direct bill; 2) premiums not being withheld even though seniors have requested such withholdings; 3) seniors who switch plans and still have premiums from their original plans withheld and not the premium amount for their new plans; and 4) the Part B premium not being withheld accurately.
   We are particularly concerned about seniors who requested premium withholding, but have not seen a reduction in their Social Security checks since they enrolled, and those who switched to higher-cost prescription drug plans, but still have their original plan's premiums withheld. In many cases, these premium errors have persisted for several months, and in some cases as long as nine or ten months. We are extremely worried that, as you continue the corrections process for the August/September claims processing period, seniors in these circumstances will face a premium withholding amount equal to several months' premiums all in one month. A lump-sum withhold such as this could severely harm those seniors who struggle to make ends meet on a fixed income.
   The highest prescription drug premiums in each of our states are significant, especially for seniors living on a fixed income. In West Virginia and Oregon, the highest premiums are approximately $70 and $60 per month, respectively. As you are aware, some seniors switched to these higher-cost plans in order to receive coverage during the doughnut hole. The difference in monthly premium amounts between the original plan and the higher-cost second plan could be as high as $40-$60 per month. Consequently, we have seniors in our states who may face premium withhold amounts as high as $240-$480. Even more troubling is the imminent withhold of several months' premiums for those seniors who have not changed plans, but as a result of processing delays, have yet to have any premiums withheld from their checks.
   We had hoped that a resolution to these two problems would have been offered at Thursday's meeting. Unfortunately, there seems to be greater confusion - not less - between your two agencies regarding what will actually happen to seniors in these circumstances in October and November. Commissioner Barnhart, you indicated that these seniors will indeed be subjected to a lump-sum withhold during a single check for these outstanding premiums. Dr. McClellan, you suggested that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will not direct the Social Security Administration to withhold more than three months' worth of outstanding premiums in one check. Instead, you suggested that seniors with outstanding balances of more than three months will be enrolled in direct bill and given the option to repay outstanding balances incrementally. Even a three month withhold in a single check could cause severe hardship for seniors living on fixed incomes. Given that these two responses are inconsistent, we are requesting that you provide written clarification of your agencies' plans for assisting seniors who are facing such unexpected financial commitments. 
   We appreciate your prompt attention to this request and ask that you respond no later than Tuesday, September 19. It is unfair to ask seniors to bear the financial burden of correcting a problem that occurred because of administrative difficulties on the part of the government. We know that you share our interest in resolving this matter quickly, and we look forward to your timely response.

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES FOR IMPROVED TRANSITION FOR RETURNING TROOPS
  As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Sen. Jay Rockefeller yesterday participated in the historic joint hearing to examine the disability ratings and transitions of service members from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  
   ""Our soldiers and their families deserve our full support as they return home. Many of them are physically wounded or wounded in spirit and we must provide them with the best possible health care, and make sure their transition home is as seamless as possible,"" said Rockefeller. 
   At the hearing, Rockefeller expressed his concern about the increase in disability claims for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that have more than doubled, from 130,000 to 270,000 VA claims, since 2000. 
   ""PTSD is a real disorder, and many of our troops and veterans aren't getting the mental health care they need,"" Rockefeller added. ""We cannot continue to deny the reality of mental illness, especially as an effect of war. We need to do more to offer care and make it easier for troops to seek mental health care."" 
   At the hearing, Rockefeller also questioned the discrepancies between the services, with each having a separate Physical Evaluation Board system, and stressed the importance of a uniform disability rating system. Press reports suggest that under the current disability rating system, 27 percent of Air Force members qualify for lifelong DoD benefits, including retirement pay, life insurance, and health insurance for themselves and their family; while only 4 percent of Army disabled soldiers and 3 percent of Marine Corps receive lifelong DoD benefits. Rockefeller sought clarifications on the reasons the Army is assigning temporary benefits and what the long-term outcomes were for soldiers and families. 
   The difference between military retirement and military discharge to VA for a soldier can be significant. While the family of a military retiree is eligible for TRICARE health coverage, VA does not provide family health care coverage. 
   Rockefeller challenged DOD and VA officials to develop a time frame for real changes in serving the returning troops. To specifically help National Guard and Reservists access care, Rockefeller is supporting new legislation to extend their eligibility from two years post-combat to five years. 
   For years, Senator Rockefeller has been working to improve the so-called ""seamless transition"" from active duty medical care to the VA health system. At veteran roundtables in West Virginia, he often hears from veterans about long-waiting periods to see a doctor, their inability to pay higher co-payments for services, or their problems with missing paperwork and bureaucratic red-tape.

  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today announced the U.S. Senate has given final approval to a measure that will help West Virginia's veterans and National Guard and Reservists keep extra money in their pockets.
   ""Recognizing the financial strains placed on many veterans, Guard and Reserve families, the Congress took action to provide these heroes with important tax relief,"" Rockefeller said. 
   The Senate by unanimous voice vote approved the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act which will provide $1.2 billion in tax relief to benefit veterans and military families nationwide. The bill includes tax cuts for members of the military who are receiving combat pay, saving for retirement or trying to purchase a home. It also provides benefits for employers of military reservists and for members of the National Guard who provide assistance to an employee's family when they are called to active duty. The tax incentives will being to take effect next year.
   ""The tax relief in this bill will go a long way to helping veterans and the families of West Virginia's National Guard and Reservists save for the future, continue to make their mortgage payments on time, or plan for their children's higher education. Moreover, we've made it even easier for an employer to continue to offer the family of a deployed employee their salary so they can continue to make ends meet,"" Rockefeller said. ""These are enormously important changes for West Virginians who are so bravely serving our nation in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan.""
   Highlights of the bill include:
   FOR ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVISTS
   * A permanent allowance for soldiers to count their non-taxable combat pay when figuring their eligibility for the earned income tax credit (EITC). The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit that puts cash in the hands of low-income working individuals and families.
   * The ability for active duty troops to withdraw money from retirement plans, and an allowance of two years to replace the funds without tax penalty.
   * A provision for a soldier's basic housing allowance to be excluded when their income status is being determined for purposes of a developer's eligibility for low-income housing credits and tax exempt bonds.
   * The ability for families of Reservists killed in the line of duty to collect life insurance and other benefits provided by the civilian employer.
   * The ability for families of soldiers killed in the line of duty to contribute up to 100 percent of survivor benefits to retirement savings accounts or to education savings accounts.
   FOR EMPLOYERS
   * A tax cut for small businesses when they continue paying some salary to members of the National Guard and Reserve who are called to duty.
   * An end to cumbersome rules for reporting of income when companies continue paying some salary to members of the National Guard and Reserve who are called to duty. This makes it easier for reservists to file their taxes and simpler for employers to keep contributing to those employees' retirement plans.
   FOR VETERANS
   * Extension of a provision that gives retired veterans more time to claim a tax refund on some types of disability benefit payments.
   * Authority for the IRS to treat gifts of thanks from states to veterans--such as payments of excess state revenue--as nontaxable gifts.
   * A permanent allowance for all veterans to use qualified mortgage bonds to purchase their homes.
   The bill now goes to the House of Representatives for its approval. A similar version of the legislation passed earlier this year by a unanimous vote. Once passed by the House, it will go to President Bush for his signature.
   Senator Rockefeller is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee which drafted the bill that passed last night.

  For the second time, President Bush vetoed a bipartisan proposal, co-authored by Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), which would continue health insurance coverage for the 40,000 West Virginia children who enroll in the state CHIP program each year. The bill would have also provided the funding necessary for the state to move forward with its planned expansion of the program to cover thousands more low-income, uninsured children.  
   The 10-year authorization of the CHIP program expired on September 30 and since then the program has been funded through two temporary spending measures - the latest stop-gap in funding will expire December 14. Rockefeller is actively working with his Senate colleagues to provide longer-term funding for CHIP that addresses ongoing federal shortfalls, so that the West Virginia children who currently rely on health insurance through CHIP will continue to receive it. 
   Rockefeller's statement on the President's veto follows: 
    ""Once again, the President had the chance to be responsible and to do what's right by West Virginia's children; and once again, he failed to do the right thing for the millions of kids nationwide who rely on CHIP for basic health care. 
   ""We listened to each of the President's concerns about our bill, whether warranted or not, and we addressed each and every one of them. 
   ""It's clear to me that the only bill President Bush will sign is one that covers fewer children and offers fewer health care benefits through CHIP and Medicaid. I cannot support any proposal that limits health insurance coverage for children through these vital programs. I will continue to lead the effort to reauthorize CHIP so that we can maintain coverage for the millions of children currently enrolled and provide access to care for the millions of additional children who are eligible but remain uninsured. I'm afraid that until we have a Democrat in the White House and larger Democratic majorities in the Congress, more children will have to wait to get the health care they need and deserve. This is a national tragedy.""

   FLOOR STATEMENT
   SENATOR JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV
   FY 2008 INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT 
   ARMY FIELD MANUAL PROVISION - SECTION 327
   FEBRUARY 13, 2008
   Mr. President, I strongly support waiver of the point of order on Section 327 of the intelligence authorization conference report. 
   It is important to provide some background on this section of the conference report. During the conference on the authorization bill, the conferees adopted an amendment that would require the Intelligence Community to conduct its interrogation in accordance with the terms of the U.S. Army Field Manual. The full membership of the House and Senate intelligence committees serve as members of the conference committee.
   Section 327 of the Intelligence Authorization conference report directly parallels the provision in the Detainee Treatment Act that forbids subjecting anyone in Department of Defense custody to ""any treatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation."" This provision applies those same restrictions to the Intelligence Community. 
   The effect of Section 327 is therefore to require that all of the United States government operate under a single interrogation standard - the standard set by the United States military. 
   Adopting the military standard for interrogation as the universal standard makes sense. It is the members of the military who most benefit from the reciprocal obligations of the Geneva Conventions requiring humane treatment of prisoners, and who are most likely to be subjected to retaliation based on the failure of the United States to follow those obligations. 
   The U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogation was revised in September 2006, after significant interagency review. This included a review by the Central Intelligence Agency. 
   By providing a number of approach strategies, like the incentive approach, emotional approach, and the Mutt and Jeff approach, the Army Field Manual gives interrogators significant flexibility to shape the interrogation. The Army Field Manual also explicitly prohibits waterboarding, forcing a detainee to be naked, inducing hypothermia or heat injury, or subjecting a detainee to beatings or other forms of physical pain, as well as a number of other things. 
   All of this raises the question at the heart of this debate - should the Central Intelligence Agency be allowed to use harsh and coercive interrogation techniques to obtain information from al-Qaeda detainees? 
   This debate is about more than legality. It is about more than ensuring the intelligence community has the tools it needs to protect us. It is also about morality and who we are and want to be as a nation, and what we represent to the world. That is a decision that can and should be left to members of Congress, the representatives of the American people.
   In the early period of the CIA program's existence, I repeatedly called for an Intelligence Committee investigation into the agency's detention and interrogation practices. I also repeatedly tried to have the CIA brief all of the members of the Committee on the interrogation program. 
   I recognized that assessing the need for the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, the intelligence obtained from detainees, and the importance of maintaining America's position in the world were issues that we in Congress needed to debate and discuss. 
   About a year and a half ago, the full membership of the Intelligence Committee was finally provided information about CIA's interrogation program. Since that time, our Committee has held multiple hearings on the subject. We have done our best to learn as much as possible about the basis for and consequences of CIA's program, as well as interrogation more generally. 
   These briefings and hearings have led the Committee to conclude that all agencies of the United States government should be required to comply with a single standard for interrogation of detainees. The Army Field Manual provides a standard of humane treatment that indisputably complies with our international obligations under the Geneva Conventions, as well as with all U.S. laws.
   The CIA has briefed the Committee on several occasions about its interrogation of al-Qaeda detainees. The CIA has described the basis for the program, and why they think it should be allowed to continue.
   Although the CIA has described the information obtained from its program, I have heard nothing that leads me to believe that information obtained from interrogation using harsh interrogation tactics has prevented an imminent terrorist attack. 
   This is true for a very simple reason. Once a terrorist is captured, his fellow plotters understandably change their plans. In other words, I do not believe the CIA has ever been in an actual ""ticking time bomb"" scenario, nor do I think it is likely to ever be placed in that situation.
   That does not mean that information obtained from the program has not been valuable. Of course, information about al-Qaeda is exceedingly valuable from an intelligence standpoint. It is bits and pieces of information that allow our intelligence professionals to assess al-Qaeda's capabilities and determine how best to protect ourselves as a nation.
   But, more to the point, I have not heard or seen any evidence that supports the Intelligence Community's claim that using enhanced interrogation techniques is the only way to obtain this type of intelligence. 
   After 9/11, the Intelligence Community decided that harsh and coercive interrogation tactics were the best way to obtain intelligence. The Intelligence Community did not research what interrogation techniques might be most effective to come to this conclusion. Nor did they reach out to interrogators with experience questioning Islamic terrorists. They simply assumed--and still assume--that coercive interrogation techniques were the best way to obtain information. 
   This was clearly a flawed approach. But at this point, the Administration is so invested in the use of these techniques that they can no longer step back to assess what methods are most effective to obtain intelligence.
   To address this question, the Committee explored how other government agencies conduct interrogation. The Committee considered critical interrogations of individuals who do not want to disclose information, interrogations where obtaining information can prevent widespread injury or death.
   Every day, military interrogators in Iraq and Afghanistan question individuals with information that can save lives--questions about where explosive devices are hidden, where captured soldiers have been taken, or where caches of weapons are stored. 
   FBI agents also face life and death situations in both the world of terrorism and every day criminal activity. Some of the individuals the FBI interrogates are senior leaders, individuals who are committed to staying silent and not sharing the information they possess. Indeed, FBI agents recently questioned the top al Qaeda leaders who were formerly in CIA custody, gathering enough information from those al-Qaeda leaders to build cases at trial. 
   Some of these FBI agents have been conducting interrogations for two or three decades, not just the 6 or so years since 9-11. They are, without question, recognized experts in their field. And they are remarkably effective at obtaining the information they need.
   Yet both the FBI and the military have told us that they do not need enhanced interrogation techniques. They have told the Committee that the interrogations techniques included in the Army Field Manual provide them the flexibility they need to obtain information. Indeed, representatives from both the military and the FBI both stated emphatically that they have the tools they need to obtain necessary and reliable intelligence. 
   After considering the CIA's arguments and those of the FBI and U.S. military, I am simply not convinced that harsh CIA tactics were necessary, or are necessary, to obtain necessary intelligence information. 
   Coercive interrogation techniques can lead prisoners to say anything to stop the interrogation. As a result, coercive techniques can produce information that is fabricated and ultimately lead to flawed and misleading intelligence reports. This is not an academic or hypothetical point. Bad intelligence is a real danger when employing coercive interrogation techniques. 
   Intelligence reporting from an al-Qaida detainee named al-Libi that Iraq was providing al-Qaida training in chemical and biological weapons prior to the war was publicly trumpeted by the President, the Secretary of State and other senior Administration officials as proof of an operational linkage between Iraq and al-Qaida and, therefore, as a basis for going for invading Iraq. Ultimately, al-Libi was determined by the CIA to have fabricated this central allegation and other information based on his claim of mistreatment during his interrogation. 
   So, this is not an academic point. America went to war based on an alleged threat that was partially based on fabricated information produced under harsh interrogation. 
   Apart from the question of efficacy and the risk of bad intelligence, the Committee has explored the consequences of having a different, secret standard of interrogation for the Intelligence Community. This is where the need for Section 327 becomes clear. 
   Since the disclosure of information about the existence of secret prisons and the use of harsh interrogation techniques, the reputation and moral authority of the United States have suffered dramatically. Rather than being a world leader in human rights, we have become known for the unapologetic use of aggressive interrogation techniques. Indeed, even Canada has included us on its list of countries that engage in torture.
   Allowing the CIA to continue to use coercive interrogation techniques that are not part of the Army Field Manual is just another piece of fodder for terrorist propaganda. It is no way to win the hearts and minds of the Muslim world. 
   Ultimately, the war against terrorism is a war of ideas. Without a public standard of humane treatment, it is impossible to convince the world that we take our international obligations seriously, that we treat people humanely, and that we are a country of laws and that we adhere to these laws. 
   We must uphold those standards that differentiate us from the terrorists that are fighting. If our government continues to use secret interrogation techniques that many are convinced constitute torture, America's standing in the world's eyes will continue to be tarnished. 
   As the Israeli Supreme Court concluded when it forbade the use of harsh interrogation techniques, 
    ""This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual's liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of security. At the end of the day, they strengthen its spirit and its strength and allow it to overcome its difficulties.""
   Passing Section 327 is critical to regaining our moral authority in the world, and convincing people that the United States believes in due process and human rights, rather than fear. Having a separate standard of interrogation for the CIA is simply not worth the cost.
   I therefore urge my colleagues to support the waiver of the points of order on Section 327.
   No matter how the Senate votes on this motion to waive points of order today, however, or whether or not the President vetoes the bill, the CIA should carefully consider the actions of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. The members of our Committees are the only members of Congress who have briefed the program, and who have been privy to the Administration's best arguments in support of the program. 
   And yet, despite those briefings, a bipartisan majority of both the House and Senate intelligence committees have determined that it is in the nation's best interest to have only one standard of interrogation, a standard that can be publicly judged by the entire world. This judgment by the representatives of the American people must not be ignored.
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

ROCKEFELLER ANGRY THAT SENIORS ARE NOT GETTING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, INFORMATION THEY NEED UNDER NEW MEDICARE DRUG PLAN
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today announced that he will introduce new legislation to help alleviate some of the frustrations seniors are experiencing as they move into the new Medicare prescription drug program. Reports across the country have indicated that many low-income seniors and disabled Americans have experienced gaps in prescription drug coverage since the program began on January 1. Overall, many elderly and disabled individuals report that the process of transitioning to the Medicare drug program has often been an exercise in futility.  
   Rockefeller and other Democrats have been warning for several years about the potential for the crisis. They have pushed for legislation to avert this problem, but their efforts were repeatedly blocked by Republicans, who did not acknowledge any fault with the program. 
   ""From the outset, we saw the potential for problems with the Medicare prescription drug program,"" said Rockefeller. ""That's why I voted against the bill in 2003, and that's why I've been working over the last few years to fix the problems with gaps in coverage.
   ""I have been hearing from seniors, pharmacists, and advocates that low-income seniors are being hurt, not helped by the government's transition to a Medicare drug benefit. If even one West Virginia senior can't get the critical medications they need, that is one senior too many.
   ""To avoid potential problems, we need to make sure that, in the short term, seniors and disabled persons receive at least 30 days of their prescription drugs. We also need to make sure that beneficiaries are being given better customer service, so that they can get their questions answered. The administration's continued disregard for problems seniors are actually experiencing has made this situation far worse and far more dangerous."" 
   In the face of this crisis, at least 14 states have announced that they have taken emergency action to help the low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are struggling to fill their prescriptions.
   As far back as 2003, when the Medicare drug bill was being debated, Rockefeller and other Senate Democrats fought to put safeguards in place for low-income seniors, but those efforts were rejected. Last year, Rockefeller introduced the Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription Drug Coverage Act to postpone the start of the transition for low-income seniors by six months to ensure prescription drug coverage for all Medicaid recipients. Every Republican in the Senate voted against this legislation. 
   Rockefeller even asked the President personally in 2003 to honor his pledge that all seniors, including the low-income seniors suffering now, would have access to their prescription drugs at all times.
   Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), refused to acknowledge problems with the program, promising a ""seamless transition"" for seniors to the new program. 
   Rockefeller is working with officials at the state and federal level to address problems that have arisen in the transition. Today, Rockefeller and other Senate Democrats are sending a letter to Michael Leavitt, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, calling for emergency measures to be taken. 
   The legislation Rockefeller will introduce next week when the Senate returns would require all prescription drug plans to provide new enrollees with at least 30 days of their prescription drugs during their transition to Medicare. The legislation would also require CMS to have one dedicated employee stationed at every Senior Health Insurance Plan site to assist beneficiaries and counselors and to act as a liaison for oversight and enforcement of the prescription drug benefit. 
   Rockefeller's bill would also require the spending of necessary resources to reduce the wait times seniors are experiencing when they call 1-800-Medicare. Finally, the bill would provide federal reimbursement for states, pharmacies, and beneficiaries for the costs that they have had to pay out-of-pocket because the Medicare prescription drug benefit has failed to cover their costs. 
   Rockefeller reminded West Virginians that they should feel free to call one of his West Virginia offices if they have questions: Charleston (304-347-5372), Beckley (304-253-9704), Fairmont (304-367-0122), or Martinsburg (304-262-9285).

ROCKEFELLER AND BYRD HELPS TO BLOCK VOTE ON ADMINISTRATION'S MSHA NOMINEE
  In an effort to make sure that mine safety remains a priority, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) mounted a successful defense against Richard Stickler, the administration's nominee to be Director of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).  
   The Senate had planned to vote on the nominee today, but Republican leadership cancelled the vote after realizing the widespread opposition that Rockefeller and Byrd mustered against him. If the White House attempts to make Stickler a recess appointment, Democrats secured a promise as a result of today's action that the Senate would be given an opportunity to vote on the nomination. Rockefeller is going farther, urging the President to immediately pull the Stickler nomination. 
   In various mine-related jobs, Stickler has a track record of undermining the safety needs of coal miners. The mines that Stickler ran were some of the most dangerous in the industry and were cited for safety violations at a rate far higher than the industry average. At his confirmation hearing, Stickler suggested that, even in the wake of accidents at Sago and Aracoma, Congress did not need to pass new mine safety legislation. 
   In an unusual move, reflecting his strong concern over the nomination, Rockefeller, who is still recuperating from major back surgery, taped an audio message to his colleagues during their weekly Democratic Caucus luncheon meeting. Rockefeller strongly urged his colleagues to vote against the Stickler nomination. 
   Please click on http://demradio.senate.gov/actualities/rockefeller/rockefeller060613.mp3 to retrieve audio for quotes below. 
   The following are audio remarks from Senator Rockefeller: 
   ""Richard Stickler is completely unqualified for this job-- by temperament and by his philosophy,"" said Rockefeller. ""The mines he ran when he was in the industry, working for the industry, were some of the most dangerous, most frequently cited for safety violations in the entire industry. In fact, his mines had a rate of preventable accidents that were 3 times the national average. So, that was when he was working for the industry. 
   ""When he was working for Governor Ridge in Pennsylvania, as the main regulator for the governor, he consistently deferred to industry rather than safeguarding the interest of miners, both union and non-union alike.
   ""In his confirmation hearing before the HELP [Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions] Committee, Richard Stickler actually said he didn't think enforcement was an issue and that Congress didn't need to pass any new laws to protect miners. Well, every senator and 381 House Members disagreed with him. 
   ""There's a very unique relationship, that I and others who come from coal states have observed over the years, between the director of MSHA and what actually takes place in safety and health in coal mines. It's an area that you can't take a chance.
   ""Richard Stickler is not qualified and should not be appointed to that position.""

ROCKEFELLER APPLAUDS DECISION BY TRADE COMMISSION TO CONTINUE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today welcomed the International Trade Commission's (ITC's) unanimous 6-0 decision to continue the strong antidumping measures against Japanese tinplate. The tariffs, which have been in place since 2000, are some assurance that West Virginia's steel industry will not be subject to unfair Japanese trade policies that existed throughout most of the 1990s.  
   ""This is a vital decision of enormous importance for our steel industry,"" Rockefeller said. ""Our steel industry has held its own over the past few years in part because the ITC rightly imposed these tariffs by using the legal methods available to it. Today, the ITC made the right decision again by not allowing the Japanese to unfairly dump cheap tin on our market."" 
   The measures were imposed following complaints from the Independent Steelworkers Union, the United Steelworkers of America, and American steel companies. Rockefeller, a member of the Senate Steel Caucus, has been particularly active on the issue and was vital in getting the initial regulations placed in 2000. 
   In written testimony before the ITC in April of this year, Rockefeller warned of the dangers of allowing the Japanese tin to flood our markets: 
   ""Families lose wages, health care plans, and pensions. College funds are wiped out; bankruptcies and foreclosures increase. Local businesses are devastated by job losses as their revenue plummets,"" Rockefeller said, adding that ""even less tax revenue is available for strapped state and local governments, which are the first line of assistance for these unemployed workers."" 
   ""Today's decision shows that in this case the commission understands what we in West Virginia have known for years,"" Rockefeller said. ""These tariffs are the last line of defense for thousands of American steelworkers and their families and they work.""

ROCKEFELLER AND WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC SAFETY HOLD WEST VIRGINIA SUMMIT ON HOMELAND SECURITY AT STONEWALL JACKSON RESORT
  Since the terrorist attacks of 9-11, homeland security has been critical for all Americans. Whether it is combating floods in our own state, assisting with Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast, or preparing for a terrorist threat - West Virginia must be ready to respond 
   After leading the enormously successful Homeland Security Summit in 2003, Senator Rockefeller is again leading the West Virginia Homeland Security Summit in coordination with the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. The Summit will include hundreds of first responders, school officials, scientists, and health experts who will be challenged to think in new and innovative ways about West Virginia's homeland security. Governor Joe Manchin and Senator Rockefeller will address the participants during Sunday night's dinner
   ""This summit will help West Virginia get ahead of the curve in terms of preparedness and expertise in responding to any type of disaster - whether it's natural or manmade,"" Rockefeller said. ""The 2-day summit will bring together emergency response professionals from all over the state, along with national leaders, who will take part in a series of panels and demonstrations to bring to life the types of real threats we are faced with every day. Whether it's a flood in McDowell County, a terrorist attack, or a mining incident, this training will go a long way toward making sure we are prepared. We may never be able to fully immunize ourselves from catastrophes, but we can control how we respond in the face of such emergencies.""
   On Sunday, the summit will host ""Hands-On Sunday"" - a series of demonstrations by various law enforcement agencies, with the centerpiece being a simulated tabletop exercise in which officials, from a state-of-the-art command center, will attempt to deal with a simulated Washington, D.C. evacuation to West Virginia. This demonstration reflects the real possibility that some day the joint forces of the WV National Guard, which have Federal Homeland Defense obligations with FEMA regions III and V, may have to respond to an attack on Washington, D.C.
   On Monday, panelists and participants will look at whether the state is prepared to address potential crises such as school disasters, financial disruptions, and health care epidemics. Capping all of the activities will be an address by former FEMA Director James Lee Witt, who will talk about his experience managing crises, mustering resources, and fighting natural disasters all over the country.

ROCKEFELLER OFFERS BILL TO ALLOW MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE LOWER PRICES WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES
  As part of his ongoing effort to make sure that West Virginia seniors and disabled persons get the prescription drugs they need at affordable prices, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has sponsored legislation that would dramatically lower seniors' prescription drugs costs in the new Medicare prescription drug bill by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. The revenue gained from this action would be used to eliminate the so-called $2,250-$5,100 ""doughnut hole"" where seniors under the new Medicare prescription drug deal have to pay 100% of their costs. At roundtables all over West Virginia, seniors have told Rockefeller that, even as early as this month, they will be falling into the doughnut hole.  
   ""West Virginia seniors are telling me how confusing and frustrating the new Medicare drug plan is for them, but it will become even worse once they reach the coverage gap,"" said Rockefeller. ""As I said all along, this bill is a disaster in the making."" 
   Under the new Medicare prescription drug plan, eligible seniors pay 25% of their initial drugs costs up to $2,250, and after a $250 deductible. Once seniors hit the $2,250 level - which millions of seniors will do during some part of the year- they are responsible for all of their drug costs until they reach $5,100 in prescription drug spending. 
   During this coverage gap, beneficiaries are still required to pay monthly premiums even though their Medicare prescription drug plan is providing no benefit. Such a situation will leave many West Virginian seniors unable to afford their needed medications. 
   Rockefeller's bill eliminates the doughnut hole for seniors by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the purchasing power of Medicare's 40 million participants to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices. During the creation of the Medicare bill in 2003, Rockefeller and other Democrats argued that the Secretary should have this ability, but Congressional Republicans, in an effort to please pharmaceutical companies, refused to take out this provision. 
   During the last few weeks, Rockefeller has held Medicare roundtables in Wheeling, Charleston, and Parkersburg. Late last week, he met with the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mark McClellan, to share the horror stories that he's been hearing at these roundtables. 
   ""There is no reason why we should not eliminate the coverage gap,"" said Rockefeller. ""We can close the coverage gap by giving Medicare the same type of negotiating authority as the Veterans Administration. I hope that my colleagues will listen to the concerns of their seniors and move quickly to pass this common-sense legislation.""

ROCKEFELLER HAILS SENATE PASSAGE OF FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced this week that the Senate passed legislation that would make it easier for disabled children in West Virginia to access health care.  
 Under the Family Opportunity Act, Medicaid services would be extended to disabled children who qualify under federal standards for disability coverage, but whose family income currently exceeds the federal Medicaid income limits. The House of Representatives is considering similar legislation. 
   ""The Family Opportunity Act makes health care more affordable for disabled children and their families,"" said Rockefeller, a cosponsor of the bill. ""The current law effectively punishes working parents for their children's disabilities. Right now, in order for lower-income families to maintain Medicaid coverage for their disabled children, many parents are forced to make the unfair choice of either remaining in poverty or giving up caring for their children at home."" 
   The Family Opportunity Act would provide families with disabled children the opportunity to purchase coverage under the Medicaid program. Medicaid offers more comprehensive benefits for less money than most private health plans. However, under current law, parents must take steps, like passing up promotions and raises, in order to keep their incomes low enough to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
   ""The Senate's action could help more than 50,000 disabled children in West Virginia alone,"" Rockefeller added. ""Many parents, even those who work more than one job, are struggling to meet the exceptional demands of raising a child with disabilities."" 
   If signed into law, the Family Opportunity Act would provide disabled West Virginian children with comprehensive Medicaid coverage that includes physical therapy, mental health services, durable medical equipment, and respite care.

ROCKEFELLER EXPRESSES CONCERN FOR AT&T WORKERS; CONDEMNS BUSH ADMINISTRATION POLICIES THAT LED TO CALL CENTER CLOSURE
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today expressed outrage for the loss of almost 275 jobs due to the closure of the AT&T's customer service center in Charleston. Sen. Rockefeller directly criticized the Bush Administration for refusing to fight for the pro-competition regulations that would have saved the Charleston jobs and delivered lower prices to consumers.  
   ""My thoughts and concerns go out to the workers and their families who are affected by the center's closing,"" said Rockefeller. ""Time and time again, we have fought to preserve these jobs, and each time West Virginia AT&T workers have stepped up to meet the industry's growing challenges and demands. I vividly remember in 1994 when the loss of this center was threatened, workers responded with an increase in productivity. I am so proud of all the efforts these workers have made."" 
   ""But this time, it was out of the workers' hands, and I'm very angry that the Bush Administration has turned its back on them,"" Rockefeller said. This summer, the Bush Administration declined to appeal the DC Circuit Court's decision to eliminate the Federal Communications Commission's rules requiring the regional Bell companies from opening their telecommunications infrastructure, as the law requires. As a result of the Administration's decision, AT&T announced in a June press release that, as one of its first steps, it would exit the local and long-distance market for West Virginia and across the country. 
   ""The loss of these jobs is a direct result of this Administration's anti-competitive and anti-consumer telecommunications' policies. Today, we felt the blow of that decision first-hand,"" Rockefeller said.
   ""West Virginians can no longer afford this Administration's telecommunications policy. I fear that another four years of this Administration will bring the loss of more jobs. Instead of competition that benefits consumers, we will see consolidation among big corporations, and we will see higher prices for consumers. Instead of more jobs for the people of West Virginia and America, we will continue to see jobs being sent overseas."" 
   On numerous occasions over the past 10 years, Senator Rockefeller has encouraged AT&T officials to maintain jobs in West Virginia. Unfortunately, due to Administration changes in telecommunications policy, the company had no choice but to close the call center. 
   Senator Rockefeller strongly supported the 1996 Telecommunications Act's competition-enhancing provisions, which increased competition and enabled West Virginians to enjoy lower prices and better services. Over 50 million Americans have benefited from the new local and long distance one-rate plans offered by both incumbents and competitors that are a result of the laws Congress enacted in 1996, although the Bush Administration's recent actions have undercut much of the earlier progress.

  Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV today urged his colleagues in the Senate not to support legislation codifying the NSA warrantless surveillance program until the Congress is fully briefed and can answer critical questions about the programs effectiveness and legality.  
   ""For Congress to legislate on this program in the coming days would not only be premature, but irresponsible,"" Rockefeller said. ""The fact is, despite repeated assurances from the Administration, Members of Congress remain in the dark and cannot answer fundamental questions about the program's scope, effectiveness or legal justification."" 
   ""As one of the few members who have received the most detailed information to date, I can say that the Administration has not been able to document convincingly the benefits of the program,"" Rockefeller said, adding, ""I support all efforts to track down terrorists wherever they are - using all of our best technology and resources. But, it must be both effective and legal, and it must be conducted in a way that protects the rights of all Americans."" 
   ""For the past six months, I have been requesting without success specific details about the program, including: how many terrorists have been identified; how many arrested; how many convicted; and how many terrorists have been deported or killed as a direct result of information obtained through the warrantless wiretapping program. 
   ""I can assure you, not one person in Congress has the answers to these and many other fundamental questions,"" Rockefeller stated emphatically. 
   ""It is clear to me that the Administration's withholding of documents is designed to hamper the Intelligence Committee's review of the NSA program. Up to this point, information provided to the Committee has been filtered and generalized through charts and slides. The Administration refuses to provide original documents, such as the Presidential authorizations, or to answer questions that go beyond their approved set of briefings,"" Rockefeller said. 
   Additionally, Rockefeller noted that legal concerns have been raised within the Administration about the program and its operation. ""General Hayden and others have publicly stated that no legal concerns have been raised within the Administration about the operation of the NSA program. The Intelligence Committee has information that contradicts this assertion, but we can't get the documents we need to understand these internal debates,"" Rockefeller concluded.

  The International Trade Commission (ITC) today voted to extend for 5 years tariffs on hot-rolled steel from Japan and Brazil and continue the suspension agreement with Russia. Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Co-Chair of the Senate Steel Caucus, urged the ITC at a hearing on March 2 to maintain the tariffs. Rockefeller said that the decision would allow West Virginia steelmakers to continue their recovery. In the year before the original ITC order took effect in 1999, Brazil, Japan, and Russia illegally dumped 7 million tons of steel in the American market. In the first year after the tariffs began, the number declined dramatically to 126,000 tons. 
   Rockefeller's statement follows: 
   ""In West Virginia, we have experienced first hand the devastating consequences that dumping has had in the past, so we know how vital these tariffs are to the survival and success of our steelworkers and steel companies. Today's decision means that our steel industry can continue its recovery from the years of illegal imports. 
   ""I agree with the ITC's decision, and I look forward to working with them in the future to ensure that our steel industry has the opportunity to compete on a level-playing field in the global market. This decision is a victory for our steel industry - it will help protect the livelihood of our steelworkers, their families, and their communities.""

ROCKEFELLER DISAPPOINTED THAT BILLIONS FOR CLEAN COAL SET ASIDE IN ENERGY BILL
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) expressed his disappointment that the U.S. Senate failed to include billions of dollars in tax incentives to begin wide-scale investments in clean coal technology as part of a comprehensive national energy policy.
   ""Coal is our most abundant source of energy and has to be part of the solution if this nation is to ever become truly energy independent. Those of us from coal states know full well that without some financial incentive to foster clean coal technology, the promise of coal as an alternative fuel will be difficult to achieve,"" Rockefeller said. ""That's why it's so disappointing to me that a number of my fellow coal state Senators would choose to put the interests of the oil and gas industry ahead of promoting clean coal."" 
   Yesterday morning, the U.S. Senate considered a version of the Energy bill that contained billions of dollars in tax incentives authored by Senator Rockefeller to begin investing in clean coal development and research. To pay for these investments, the bill would have reduced the tax breaks granted to oil companies that have been experiencing record profits. However, oil and gas state Senators, with the backing of a veto threat by President Bush, vowed to oppose the bill if it contained any tax incentives for the development of alternative fuels. As a result, the bill required 60 votes in order to overcome these objections - it failed 59-40.
   Late last night, Senate Democrats were forced to bring a scaled down version of the Energy bill back for consideration that did not include tax incentives for alternative fuel development - including the Rockefeller-authored clean coal provisions.
   ""I'm not going to give up the fight for clean coal, and there will be many more opportunities to advance Appalachian coal and clean coal technology as a solution to our energy needs,"" Rockefeller said. ""But coal state Senators have to stick together - we have to put clean coal first.""
   Rockefeller voted for the final bill as an important first step toward a sensible national energy policy by increasing fuel efficiency standards for new cars and light trucks from 27.5 to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. It's estimated this increase in fuel standards will conserve 1.1 million barrels of oil daily and save drivers $22 billion annually. The bill also includes new energy efficiency standards for household and industrial appliances and government office building. It also makes price gouging at the gasoline pump a federal crime.
   The scaled-back Energy bill now moves to the House of Representatives for a vote sometime next week. It will then be sent to the President for his signature.
   Rockefeller's Proposed Clean Coal Investments
   With the next generation of clean coal plants currently being designed and built, there is a pressing need to invest in carbon capture and sequestration research to help mitigate the affect on global climate change.
   Understanding this, Senator Rockefeller authored several provisions that would have put clean coal development on the right path. The provisions that were stripped out of the Energy bill over Rockefeller's objections included:
   * $1.5 billion in tax credits for coal plants that commit to capturing 65% of their carbon dioxide emissions. An additional $500 million would have been available for plants that pursue 75% gasification efforts. Additionally, Rockefeller secured $50 million for a new ten-year tax credit for the depreciation of pipelines that carry CO2 underground for sequestration.
   * A provision supported by the Senator that would have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the National Academy of Science to audit the US tax code for opportunities to increase investments in carbon capture and research.
   * $120 million to refund certain coal export excise taxes that the Courts have ruled were unconstitutional to collect. Coal producers affected by this ruling would have been eligible to obtain a refund on the taxes paid plus interest.

ROCKEFELLER HAILS PASSAGE OF BILL TO IMPROVE VETERANS BENEFITS, QUALITY OF LIFE FOR NATIONAL GUARD, RESERVISTS
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today hailed the U.S. Senate's passage of the FY 08 Defense Authorization Conference Report that will strengthen military readiness, increase benefits for West Virginia's National Guard and Reservists, and provide tax relief to veterans and military families.
   The measure also includes the Rockefeller cosponsored bill the Wounded Warriors Act, which was authored in the wake of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center scandal, to better address veteran and active duty military health care benefits and services - and to address the unique needs of veterans suffering from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 
   ""We've asked our National Guard and Reservists to serve on the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan and always be prepared if disaster strikes closer to home. They're doing everything that we ask of them, but they need to have the equipment to do the job and better benefits to care for their families,"" Rockefeller said. ""And for our veterans who return home, some bearing the physical and emotional scars of war, we need to ensure that they get the best physical and mental health care. And we recognize that having the support of a family is crucial to the healing process, so we've made it easier for loved ones to care for their wounded warrior.""
   The FY'08 Defense Authorization Act Conference Report was passed by the Senate by a vote of 90-3. It includes provisions to provide much needed equipment to soldiers in the field, gives active duty service members a 3.5 percent pay raise, and addresses the care of injured soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. (A fact sheet is attached)
   The joint Senate-House agreement also prohibits fee increases for the military HMO known as TRICARE, ensures adequate staffing levels at military hospitals, and extends the VA health insurance eligibility of a service member who served in combat to 5 years, instead of the current 2 years, to better address the medical needs of soldiers, including the rising incidents of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
   Additionally, the bill improves transparency in military contracting by establishing a Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan to study and investigate federal agency contracting for reconstruction. For private security contractors operating in those countries, the bill requires that they comply with DOD regulations on the use of force, as well as orders and directives from combat commanders regarding the security, health, safety, and interactions with Iraqi and Afghani civilians.
   The legislation also focuses attention on the growing conflict in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region by requiring a report on Pakistan's efforts to eliminate safe havens for violent extremists on its territory and to prevent cross-border incursions by those extremists into Afghanistan.
   The bill contains a number of provisions that will improve the morale, readiness and benefits for National Guard and Reservists. First, the bill increases the rank of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from lieutenant general (three stars) to general (four stars) and expands the eligibility requirements and duties.
   To better improve the National Guard's response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive incident, the bill provides an increase of $30 million for the procurement of specialized detection equipment that can be used both for overseas deployments and domestically. The measure also creates an advisory panel to assess the ability of the DOD and civil authorities to respond to such an incident.
   President Bush is expected to sign the bill into law by the end of the month.

   FISCAL YEAR 2008 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
   Enhanced Benefits for Reservists
   * Allows Reservists, who serve on active duty, to use their enhanced educational benefits for up to 10 years after leaving the reserves (currently they must be used immediately) and to be paid on an accelerated basis. It also allows Reservists with three cumulative years of active duty service to qualify for education benefits at 80 percent of the active duty rate. (Currently, they are required to serve two years continuous active duty to get this benefit.)
   * Reduces the age at which a Reservist can draw retirement below the age of 60 by 3 months for every aggregate 90 days of active duty service in most military operations.
   * Reimburse up to $300 for travel expenses for reserve training.
   * Establishes a national combat veteran reintegration program to help reservists reintegrate into their families and communities through family services and post-deployment screening.
   Improved Treatment of Returning Veterans
   * The FY 08 Defense Authorization Conference Report takes essential steps to respond to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center scandal by improving the care of injured soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan - addressing many of the issues raised by the Dole-Shalala Commission and implementing several of its recommendations. The measure improves outpatient medical care for wounded service members at military health care facilities; begins restoring integrity and efficiency to disability evaluations and cutting bureaucratic red-tape; and improves the transition of wounded service members from the Armed Forces to the VA system.
   Key Improvements include
   * Changing the Family Medical Leave Act to provide six months of unpaid, job-protected leave to the spouse, parent, child, or next of kin of service members who suffer from a service-connected injury or illness;
   * Creating the Wounded Warrior Resource Center to serve as the single point of contact for service members, their families, and caregivers to report issues with facilities, obtain health care, and receive benefits information;
   * Requiring semi-annual inspections of housing facilities for recovering service members;
   * Requiring the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a comprehensive policy on the care and management of members of the armed forces, including the development of fully interoperable electronic health records;
   * Mandating the establishment of new standards for: processing disability evaluations to reduce discrepancies between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, training for disability evaluation personnel, rating disabilities that take into account all medical conditions, as well as requiring a pilot program for improving the disability evaluation system;
   * Mandates the establishment of new standards for processing medical evaluations, training and qualifying those performing the evaluations, and assigning independent medical advisors to assist recovering service members and families;
   * Requiring a comprehensive policy to address traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other mental health conditions, establishing DOD Centers of Excellence on PTSD and TBI to improve treatment, research, training and rehabilitation, requiring enrollment and registry of TBI patients to ensure continuity of care, guaranteeing veterans a VA mental health assessment within 30 days of request, expanding hiring to address shortage in mental health professionals, and strengthening DOD training for better detection of PTSD.; and
   * Requiring a DOD study of the support services provided to families of recovering service members, and a National Academy of Sciences study on the physical and mental health needs of those deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan.
   Tax Relief for Disabled Veterans and Military Families
   * Takes several steps toward ending the Disabled Veterans Tax -. It expands the special compensation for combat-related disabled retirees to cover all who are medically retired for combat disabilities. (Under current law, they must have served 20 years.) It also speeds up the end of the disabled veterans tax for veterans who are 100 percent disabled, making that effective January 1, 2005 instead of October 1, 2009. This legislation is essential for the more than 28,000 injured personnel who are returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, many of whom are amputees or have combat-related injuries and must be medically retired.
   * Makes progress in ending the Military Families Tax, which unfairly penalizes the more than 60,000 survivors, most of them widows, of those who have died as a result of their service-connected injuries. Currently, these widows lose their survivor benefits if they also receive Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits (because their spouse died of a service-connected injury), but this measure establishes a special survivor indemnity allowance of $50 per month to begin to address this tax - increasing to $100 by 2014.

  Honoring veterans who overcame racism to serve their country, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has co-sponsored a bill that would authorize the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen, whose ranks included fourteen West Virginians.  
   ""This honor is long overdue,"" said Rockefeller. ""These men stepped forward to defend our nation against the horrors of Hitler's Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, they found themselves battling racist treatment by their own countrymen along the way. To their great credit, these men fought through this unjust treatment because their sense of duty to their country was so great.
   ""I believe the Congressional Gold Medal is an appropriate and well-deserved expression of the appreciation Americans have for their courage and service.""
   Several of the West Virginian Tuskegee Airmen attended West Virginia State University, which has a rich history of creating military leaders. More military generals have graduated from West Virginia State than any other non-military college in the nation.
   The 1000 black pilots who graduated from Tuskegee inspired revolutionary reform in the armed forces, paving the way for integration of the United States armed services. Of those pilots, 450 served in combat, 66 died in combat, while another 33 were shot down and captured as prisoners of war. The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with destroying 261 aircraft, damaging 148 aircraft, flying 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy and North Africa. They destroyed or damaged over 950 units of ground transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing missions.

ROCKEFELLER ADDRESSES WORKERS' RIGHTS IN BANKRUPTCY
  With many West Virginia workers and retirees suffering from the consequences of companies going bankrupt, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has introduced legislation to strengthen employees' rights in bankruptcy. Rockefeller's Bankruptcy Fairness Act, S. 329, would ensure that employees and retirees are able to recover more of what is owed to them in wages and benefits, including critical retiree health coverage. 
   ""People work their entire lives under the promise that they will receive certain compensation. Yet, sadly we have seen some companies in the last few years abandon these promises when they declare bankruptcy,"" Rockefeller said. ""Our employees and retirees need better protection."" 
   The Bankruptcy Fairness Act would specifically help bankrupt companies' employees and retirees on three fronts. The bill would:
   * Ensure Compensation for Retirees Who Lose Health Coverage. If an employer reduces retiree health care benefits as part of a bankruptcy plan, retirees would be entitled to cash compensation, in addition to the general unsecured claim they receive under current law. The compensation is designed to enable retirees to purchase comparable health insurance for another 18 months.
   * Increase Workers' Priority Claim Against Company Assets. The bill allows employees to recover more of the back-pay, vacation time, severance, or benefit payments that the company owes them at the time it declares bankruptcy. Current law grants an employee a priority claim of $4,925 against the company's assets; Rockefeller's bill would increase the claim to $15,000.
   * Recover Excessive Pay to Executives or Insiders. The bill provides bankruptcy courts the authority to recover company assets in cases where company managers flagrantly paid excessive compensation to favored employees just before declaring bankruptcy.
  ""I am offering this legislation so that we can start a dialogue about how to better protect workers whose companies file for bankruptcy. I will push Congress to begin a vigorous debate about the best way to ease the burden that bankruptcy imposes on employees and retirees.""

ROCKEFELLER MEETS WITH WEST VIRGINIANS TO DISCUSS SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller met with West Virginians yesterday representing the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) State Association (Coalitions for a Better West Virginia) and the West Virginia Teen Court Association, to discuss substance abuse issues.  
   ""The volunteers that I met with are on the front lines of an effort to turn the tide of substance abuse in West Virginia through education and developing stronger communities,"" Rockefeller said. ""Their successes should serve as an example to others that West Virginians will not give in to the insidious effect of substance abuse in our communities."" 
   The network of West Virginians, who represented Mercer, McDowell, Wyoming, Greenbrier and Nicholas Counties, were in DC for the national CADCA forum. Mercer and Monroe Counties were recognized this year by America's Promise Alliance for Youth as two of the top 100 communities for their work with young people. 
   In meeting with the organizations, Rockefeller said, ""My message to you all is simple: keep fighting for your communities and West Virginia."" 
   In the 1980s, Rockefeller helped to create the Safe and Drug Free Schools program, which has helped to achieve a 23 percent overall decline in youth drug use over the past five years. It has served 37 million students nationwide. President Bush's 2008 budget proposes a decrease in funding for the state grants portion of this program, which funds drug prevention education, by $255 million. 
   ""Understandably, many West Virginians have serious concerns about substance abuse in their areas. The challenges in our communities are proof that we need local organizations and grassroots efforts like these, and the funding to back them, more than ever before,"" said Rockefeller. ""They are critical to our children, our families, and each of our communities - and I will do everything I can to support them.""

ROCKEFELLER URGES PRESIDENT TO MAKE VETERANS FUNDING A TOP BUDGET PRIORITY THIS YEAR
  Working to make sure that veterans receive the health care benefits that they deserve and have earned, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and 32 of his Senate colleagues wrote President Bush today, asking him to substantially increase funding for America's veterans.  
   ""The administration has repeatedly not provided the necessary resources for the thousands of men and women who have made such personal sacrifices to defend our country,"" said Rockefeller, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
   ""We know that our veterans system is already under pressure to meet the needs of our current veterans. Now, with thousands of new veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, we must increase veterans funding. After all they have done for our country, the least that we can do is to meet the benefits and provide the care they have been promised."" 
   Recent budgets have provided inadequate funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), something acknowledged even by former VA Secretary Anthony Principi last year in congressional testimony. The letter to President Bush represents an effort to weigh in with the President before he submits the FY 2006 budget to Congress next month.
   ""It is imperative that VA is able to provide high-quality primary and specialty care in a timely manner, in addition to long-term and mental health care for those who require it,"" the Senators wrote President Bush. ""It is already apparent that both of these services will continue to be in high demand and we cannot ignore them as we shape the future of VA health care. We all have an obligation to the men and women who serve our nation to ensure that VA gets the funding it so desperately needs to meet these goals.
   ""We sincerely hope that your budget will be a message to the heroes of our conflicts B past and present B that their sacrifices are not forgotten. Your support will go a long way in keeping the promises we have made to our nation's veterans.""
   Also signing the letter were Senators Daniel Akaka (HI), Kent Conrad (ND), Frank Lautenberg (NJ), Patty Murray (WA), Bill Nelson (FL), Byron Dorgan (ND), Dick Durbin (IL), Ben Nelson (NE), Tim Johnson (SD), Carl Levin (MI), Jack Reed (RI), Hillary Clinton (NY), Jim Jeffords (VT), Charles Schumer (NY), Jeff Bingaman (ND), Debbie Stabenow (MI), Christopher Dodd (CT), Mark Dayton (MN), Patrick Leahy (VT), Harry Reid (NV), Ken Salazar (CO), Barack Obama (IL), Tom Harkin (IL), Mary Landrieu (LA), Barbara Mikulski (MD), Edward Kennedy (MA), Maria Cantwell (WA), John Kerry (MA), Blanche Lincoln (AR), Paul Sarbanes (MA), Mark Pryor (AR), and Max Baucus (MT). 
   The text of the letter follows: 
   The Honorable George W. Bush
  President of the United States
  The White House
  Washington, DC 20500
   Dear Mr. President:
   We are writing to urge you to demonstrate true leadership by giving high priority to the needs of our nation=s veterans in the Fiscal Year 2005 budget.
   The ongoing conflicts abroad mandate that our country maintain well-trained, healthy, and disciplined armed forces. However, we should be mindful at all times that we must remain committed Ato care for him who has borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.@ Fulfillment of our obligation to these brave men and women who volunteer to defend this nation requires constant vigilance on the part of Congress as well as the Executive Branch B vigilance that does not end when the soldier leaves the battlefield.
   As in years past, we will work in a bipartisan manner to support adequate funding for the VA health care system to care for veterans. Simply covering payroll increases for VA health care personnel and medical inflation is not enough. Last year, the Senate added $2.4 billion in funding for VA to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for 2004. With 60,000 veterans still waiting in lines for care nationwide, each of us has a responsibility to ensure that the VA health care system receives full appropriated funding, not a scheme that relies on increasing copayments and introducing new fees to veterans in order to finance the system and reduce demand.
   VA must be able to provide high-quality primary and specialty care in a timely manner, as well as long-term and mental health care to those who require it. We all have an obligation to the men and women who serve our nation to ensure that VA gets the funding it so desperately needs to meet these goals.
   We sincerely hope that your budget will be a message to the heroes of our conflicts B past and present B that their sacrifices are not forgotten. Your support will go a long way in furthering the promise we have made to the veterans of our country.

  In an attempt to combine science with good environmental practices, Sen.  
 Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) has introduced the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act. The bill would provide $33 million in research money next year to develop chemical and engineering processes that reduce threats to our air and water. Backed by West Virginia chemical companies, including DuPont, the bill could also provide resources for research programs at West Virginia University and Marshall University. 
   ""Green chemistry is not just one of those catchy phrases we sometimes use in Congress to get people to pay attention,"" said Rockefeller. ""Green chemistry is the future. Funding research at our universities and federal agencies to create more environmentally-responsible chemical processes will mean that companies can provide the products our nation wants in ways that are safer for our residents."" 
   Rockefeller's legislation would establish a Green Chemistry Research and Development Program under a federal inter-agency working group to promote future research about green chemistry applications, including the use of non-toxic chemical technology. The working group would include the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   The program would also promote partnerships between universities, industry and nonprofit organizations, as well as support research and development at federal laboratories. The legislation would authorize merit-based competitive grants for green chemistry curriculum development. West Virginia University and Marshall could be beneficiaries of these grants. 
   The bill has been endorsed by a number of chemical companies, including DuPont. The American Chemical Society has also endorsed the bill.

ROCKEFELLER APPLAUDS RECENT HHS DECISION TO ALLOW FREE CLINICS TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN PAP PROGRAMS
  Representing another victory in his ongoing effort to make sure that West Virginia's seniors get the prescription drugs they need, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is welcoming a recent federal government decision that will help thousands of West Virginia seniors receive their medications. The decision, which was made by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), was in response to an inquiry filed by West Virginia's Health Right. Sen. Rockefeller pushed HHS to expedite the decision.  
   ""This decision is great news for thousands of West Virginia seniors,"" said Rockefeller. ""Our seniors who use these clinics will be able to continue receiving the prescription drugs they cannot live without. This decision was right, it was appropriate, and it will have an immediate impact on the health and well-being of so many people in our state and across the country.""
   West Virginia's Health Right is a free medical clinic that serves thousands of low-income seniors throughout the state. The clinic, along with hundreds of other similar clinics nationwide, sought guidance from HHS about whether it could continue to participate in so-called Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs). In PAPs, brand-name drug manufacturers provide prescription drugs for free or at a significantly reduced cost to patients in need.
   In recent months, Rockefeller has met with officials and clients at both West Virginia Health Right and Wheeling Health Right. Many of the roundtable attendees described the issue as a ""matter of life and death.""
   ""West Virginia's Health Right really took the lead in seeking this important guidance,"" said Rockefeller. ""They made the right move - and so did HHS. Over the last few months, the HHS Inspector General has worked tirelessly to provide additional guidance on ways pharmaceutical manufacturers can continue their patient assistance programs for Medicare beneficiaries. The recent free clinic decision provides yet another legal avenue for drug companies to keep these programs running,""  
   Rockefeller, the Ranking Member of the Finance Subcommittee on Health, has taken the lead in Congress in pushing drug companies to continue their PAP programs. Since the end of last year, Rockefeller has worked with a core group of bipartisan Senators in pushing HHS to provide clarification on some of their rules and regulations on PAP programs. The result has been that many Medicare beneficiaries will continue to have access to these vital programs.

ROCKEFELLER, SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE URGE ADMINISTRATION TO EXPAND TRADE ASSISTANCE TO SERVICE WORKERS
  In an effort to help the thousands of American service workers who have lost their jobs as a result of unfair trade policies, the Senate Finance Committee today voted to authorize millions of dollars in retraining, income support, and health insurance tax credits for displaced workers as they look for another job. 
   ""This is long overdue,"" said Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), who led the charge in the Finance Committee. Members of the Finance Committee had been negotiating a compromise until Rockefeller intervened and urged calling the votes because it was so critical to U.S. service workers. That forced an official committee vote on the issue, and it prevailed.
   ""This measure would provide support for our workers in West Virginia and across the country who have lost their jobs as a result of unfair international trade policies. These individuals still have to pay mortgages, put food on the table, and take care of their families. We must make sure they have the support they need to survive while they look for new employment.""
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Service Workers amendment that passed in the Finance Committee would authorize $220 million in funds to extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance program beyond the industrial sector to include service workers and firms in the services sector. The amendment covers three categories of impacted service workers: (1) those who lose their jobs when their employer closes or lays them off because of import competition; (2) public and private sector service workers who lose their jobs when their facility moves overseas; and (3) secondary service workers who provide services to a primary firm where workers are eligible for TAA and whose closure causes the layoffs or closure of the secondary firm. 
   Between 2001-2003, the technology sector lost 750,000 jobs, many as a result of outsourcing or import competition. One estimate claims that an additional 3.3 million jobs may be lost in the next decade due to unfair trade agreements.
   The amendment was part of debate on the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The Finance Committee met today to offer the administration recommendations on the trade pact. Rockefeller opposes CAFTA because he fears that this pact could generate similar consequences as those that occurred in the decade following the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. After that agreement, many American companies took advantage of lower wages and weaker regulatory standards and moved jobs to Mexico.

   ""Despite assertions by the Chairman, the Senate Intelligence Committee has not reached any conclusion regarding Under Secretary Bolton's actions. In fact, the Committee as a whole has not been given access to the intelligence reports in question, and the Administration has not allowed any Senator to review the U.S. names requested by and shown to Mr. Bolton. 
   ""Most recently, Chairman Roberts and I were both made aware of the fact that Mr. Bolton divulged the name of at least one individual that was cited in an intelligence report. This action by Mr. Bolton was not authorized by the National Security Agency as required and, therefore, inappropriate. In order to gain a better understanding of Mr. Bolton's actions, I have written Secretary Rice seeking additional information regarding this incident,"" Rockefeller said. 
   ""I remain hopeful that all pertinent information regarding Mr. Bolton will be made available to all Senators prior to the final vote on his confirmation,"" Rockefeller concluded.

   Dear Director Negroponte:
   On June 9, 2005, Senators Joseph Biden and Christopher Dodd wrote to Senator Pat Roberts and me requesting our assistance as the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in resolving the impasse related to the nomination of John Bolton to be Ambassador to the United Nations. They asked that we serve as intermediaries in a process to compare a list of names they have prepared to the names of U.S. persons provided to Mr. Bolton by the National Security Agency. Senator Roberts apparently has decided not to participate in that process. I, however, think it is important to find a compromise in the current standoff so I am offering my assistance as the Vice Chairman to provide a conduit for this information exchange. 
   Under their proposal, Senators Biden and Dodd would provide you a limited list of names, approximately three dozen, to compare to the 19 U.S. person identities provided to Under Secretary Bolton. If there is no overlap between the two lists, they will drop their request to see the names and the intelligence reports. If there are any names appearing on both lists, Senator Roberts and I, if he is willing to participate, would work with you to understand the context of those requests and to reach a determination as to whether there was anything inappropriate about the request for, or use of those names. I have attached a copy of the letter from Senators Biden and Dodd.
   I appreciate your continuing efforts to resolve this issue, and I understand your desire to protect sensitive sources and methods. Obviously, I share this concern. I believe the proposal from Senators Biden and Dodd is a reasonable approach to reaching this goal while satisfying the request for additional information.
   My colleagues and I want to move the process forward and allow the Senate to vote on this nomination. But Senators have a right to review materials they deem relevant to the nomination. Senators Biden and Dodd and the other members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have shown exceptional flexibility in trying to work out a mutually agreeable process. It is my hope that you will find this arrangement satisfactory. 
   Thank you for consideration of this request.
   Sincerely,
  John D. Rockefeller IV
  Vice Chairman

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS FOR WEST VIRGINIA'S FIREFIGHTERS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) introduced legislation this week aimed at getting more money to local fire departments. The bill would reauthorize funding for the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act amounting to more than $6 billion nationwide over the next five years. The FIRE Act provides grants to individual fire departments so that they can purchase firefighting equipment, train firefighters, and establish new fire prevention services. 
   ""Everyday, West Virginia firefighters put their lives on the line to protect their families and communities,"" Rockefeller said. ""Many of our local fire departments are small and many cannot afford to buy all the equipment they need to do their job effectively. We have made many improvements, but we still have a long way to go. Appropriate funding for local fire departments is a mission critical for emergency preparedness and homeland security.""
   According to a 2002 National Needs Assessment study of the U.S. Fire Service, most fire departments do not have the resources they need to properly handle terrorist attacks and large-scale emergencies. The FIRE Act, if fully funded, would provide the money needed to train West Virginia's 16,000 firefighters for disaster situations. The bill also takes specific steps to help smaller states, like West Virginia, by improving access to federal grants for fire departments serving rural communities. 
   ""By providing West Virginia fire departments with funding for a sufficient number of vehicles, radios, protective gear, and the ability to add new firefighters, the federal government will be putting money in local hands where it is desperately needed, and helping these departments to serve their communities,"" Rockefeller added.
   Senator Rockefeller was an original cosponsor of the FIRE Act in 1999, and since then, he has fought efforts by the Bush Administration to cut funding from the program. The FIRE Act is funded through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Office of Domestic Preparedness in the Department of Homeland Security.

""By giving these students the opportunity to pursue higher education we will, in turn, develop a highly skilled workforce that can take on the challenges of the new global economy."" 
   The federal funding will provide grants to institutions of higher education through the TRIO's Upward Bound program. These grants will fund approximately 575 participants from seven different colleges and universities across West Virginia. The colleges and universities receiving funding are: 
   Concord University
  Athens: $390,929

   Upward Bound provides fundamental support and opportunities to participants to succeed in their pre-college performance and their preparation for college entrance. Increasing the rate at which participants complete secondary education, Upward Bound provides them with 6-week summer programs on college campuses, as well as tutoring and mentoring to support college attendance. Participants of Upward Bound include high school students from low-income families, high school students from families in which neither parent holds a bachelor's degree, and low-income, first-generation military veterans who are preparing to enter post-secondary education. 
   Throughout his career, Senator Rockefeller has been a strong advocate of education funding and has fought to promote funding for TRIO programs. In recent years the Administration has sought to limit funding to TRIO while Rockefeller continues to push for increased funding for these vital education programs.

  Following news that the Medicare Rights Center has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the 6.4 million dual eligibles - those Americans who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare coverage because they are low-income or have high health care spending - Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, Chair of the Senate Democratic Working Group on Medicaid, issued the following statement:  
   ""We are already seeing America's seniors frustrated by the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. For dual eligibles, the confusion will be far greater. These dual eligibles are among the most vulnerable of our nation's citizens. They are disproportionately women and minorities, and they live alone or in nursing homes. They are much more likely to be beset with debilitating heart disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, or Alzheimer's. In short, these are the people who desperately need prescription drug coverage, but they are also the people most likely not to receive that coverage beginning in January.
   ""Simply put, we are on course for a train wreck when the Medicaid prescription drug coverage of these dual eligibles ends abruptly on January 1. Some will not know they have been automatically enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan, while others may lose access to needed prescription drugs.
   ""Unless the Department of Health and Human Services lives up to their end of the bargain, we could see a health care disruption of a magnitude never before seen in this country.""
   The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created several contingency plans for the dual eligibles, but question about abound whether they will guarantee that dual eligibles will be able to immediately obtain the prescription drugs they need. The Medicare Rights Center lawsuit could force HHS to meet their statutory requirement for all dual eligibles to have prescription drug coverage on January 1, 2006. 
   Earlier this year, Rockefeller introduced the Medicare Dual Eligible Coverage Act of 2005 to give dual eligibles the time and resources they need to transition to Medicare prescription drug coverage. Rockefeller's bill would extend the availability of Medicaid prescription drug coverage for dual eligibles to July 1, 2006. That extension would be consistent with the six months that non-dual eligibles have been given to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan.

   ""As the highway bill is considered by the Conference Committee, we need to make sure that these vehicle standards are included in the final bill,"" said Rockefeller. ""Our letter highlights the need to include these so that West Virginians and all Americans are safer as they travel on our roads and highways. Lives depend on the passage of these standards.""  
   Last year, 42,643 people nationwide and 394 West Virginians died in highway accidents. For Americans aged 1 to 34, traffic fatalities remain the leading cause of death. Senator Rockefeller has been a long-time advocate of vehicle safety. He also has worked to give states the resources necessary to improve safety on their roads.

ROCKEFELLER MEETS WITH MITTAL STEEL USA CEO, EXPRESSES DEEP ANGER, CONCERN ABOUT CLOSING OF HOT END PLANT
  Today, Sen. Jay Rockefeller had a meeting with Mittal Steel USA Chief Executive Officer Louis Schorsch in his Washington office to discuss the recent closing of Mittal's hot end plant in Weirton. Sen.  
 Rockefeller was extremely frustrated by the lack of consultation by executives at Mittal and made his views explicitly known.
   ""I'm extremely frustrated by Mittal steel's decision to close the hot end plant, and I made absolutely sure that the U.S. CEO, Mr. Schorsch, knew exactly how I felt. Had Mittal been willing to reinvest in Weirton and our workers, we would have proved once again that we could be more than competitive on a global scale,"" Rockefeller said. ""Instead, the closing of the hot end plant has dealt an enormous blow to the Ohio Valley and those who depend on Mittal Steel for their livelihood.""
   Rockefeller added, ""During today's meeting, I pressed for a commitment on the future of the tin plate facility. I told Mr. Schorsch that Mittal must make a commitment to keeping our tin plate operations strong and running full speed. Weirton produces first-rate, high quality tin plate, and these operations must continue to prosper - and I hope expand - in the coming years. While Schorch said the company intends to try to make the tin side more profitable, I made sure that he knew I would hound him every day, wherever I had to go around the world to find him, until we get a firm commitment about the future.
   ""I will not stand by while Mittal plays with the lives of the finest steelworkers in the world. Weirton deserves better.""

ROCKEFELLER OPPOSES INCREASES IN VETERANS' HEALTH CARE FEES
  In a Senate Veterans' Affairs hearing today on the proposed FY2006 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) reiterated his belief that veterans should not have to pay higher health care fees to make up shortfalls in VA funding. If the budget goes through as proposed, some veterans will have to pay $250 in an annual fee to use VA health care and will see their prescription drug co-payments more than double.  
   ""I am very disappointed with the effort to try to impose new fees and double prescription drug co-payments,"" Rockefeller told VA Secretary Jim Nicholson. ""I think that these increases will be automatically rejected, as they have been in both Houses of Congress in the past. And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that they are.""
   Under the budget proposed last week, veterans with incomes as low as $26,000 could see prescription drug co-payments climb from $7 to $15. Three years ago, the co-payment stood at just $2. The budget could also impose a new $250 annual fee for over 1 million of the nation's veterans currently depending on VA health care. In addition, the budget will continue to bar nearly 200,000 Priority 8 veterans from enrolling in the VA health care system, including 1,869 veterans from West Virginia. 
   Rockefeller also told Nicholson that the approximately $9 million in cuts to VA's medical research program are troubling and asked how it might affect victims of Gulf War veterans' illnesses. ""I spent 10 years on this Committee fighting for more research on Gulf War veterans' illnesses,"" said Rockefeller, saying that the push for research has proven us ""correct"" in believing that Gulf War veterans were returning with serious illnesses. 
   In 1995, Rockefeller pushed VA to create a registry to track illnesses in veterans and their families. In 1998, Rockefeller helped pass the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act, which called for ongoing research into the effects of chemicals on soldiers and extending that research to include spouses and the children of veterans. 
   ""Last year, former Secretary Principi pledged $60 million in continuing research over several years for Gulf War veterans' illnesses,"" Rockefeller reminded Nicholson. ""We need to make sure that we continue this research. 
   ""Mr. Nicholson, I know that in some ways you have inherited this budget, but at some point, you can't get around the fact that this budget does not provide enough money for our veterans.""

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES LABOR SECRETARY CHAO FOR MORE ACTION ON MINE SAFETY
  In an effort to accelerate mine safety reforms by the Department of Labor, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today called on Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao to use her existing authority to make coal mining safer in West Virginia and across the country.
   Last week, the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) noticed its intention to use an emergency temporary standard that will bring about better rescue operations for miners, but the Department's temporary action does not go nearly as far as legislation introduced last week by Rockefeller, Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV), and the rest of the West Virginia congressional delegation.  
   In his letter to Secretary Chao, Rockefeller wrote, ""The mine safety improvements you have announced are very welcome news to me and to the brave men and women working in mines and West Virginia and around the country, but I hope you will agree that your proposed changes constitute only a first and very basic step toward an adequate level of safety for America's miners. To continue on this path, I would suggest using your existing statutory authority to expedite action on all provisions in the legislation I introduced jointly with Senator Byrd and our West Virginia House colleagues earlier this month."" 
   MSHA's temporary standard doesn't go nearly as far as the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, introduced in the Senate by Rockefeller and Byrd. MSHA's action requires more oxygen-generating self-rescuers for mines, the training of miners to better enable them to change from one self-rescuer to another, and the construction of lighted or reflective ""lifelines"" to signal escape routes for miners in the event of accidents in the mine. Additionally, MSHA would define companies' responsibility to ""immediately contact"" the agency in the event of an accident or occurrence. 
   The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 2006 requires much more. It mandates the Secretary of Labor to require, within 90 days, advanced communications and breathing devices; rescue teams on staff and on-site; a schedule of fines for mine safety violations that will actually bring about behavior modification; and more rapid and effective notification to federal safety officials. The bill also calls on MSHA to enforce a longstanding rule to require coal conveyor belts in fresh air escapeways, and it creates a Miner Ombudsman in the Office of the Department of Labor's Inspector General. A companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Nick Rahall (D-WV), Congressman Alan Mollohan (D-WV), and Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). 
   ""On behalf of miners in West Virginia and throughout the United States I urge you to seriously consider including all of the provisions in the legislation introduced by the West Virginia delegation in any emergency rulemaking you should publish,"" Rockefeller wrote Secretary Chao. ""I believe firmly that a failure to address all known deficiencies in the current MSHA regulatory agenda could lead to additional deaths or serious injuries to miners in Appalachia and other coal-producing regions. I trust you will agree that such an outcome would be senseless and inexcusable.""

ROCKEFELLER CALLS FOR IMPROVED FIRE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN EXISTING BUILDINGS
  In the wake of a tragic fire last month in Huntington that claimed the lives of nine people at the Emmons Jr. apartment building, Sen. Jay Rockefeller has reintroduced legislation first offered in 2005 that would make it easier to upgrade fire sprinkler systems in older buildings.  
   ""Sprinkler systems and alarms are not amenities, they are absolute necessities,"" Rockefeller said. ""Knowing that older apartment buildings, college residence halls and commercial structures have adequate fire safety systems brings peace of mind to those who live and work within their walls."" 
   Toward this end, Senators Rockefeller and Gordon Smith (R-OR) reintroduced the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act. Under current law, property owners who install sprinkler systems in older buildings are allowed to deduct the costs over a period of 27.5 or 39 years, depending on the structure. The Rockefeller bill would allow businesses to recoup those costs within 5 years. 
   ""This is a win-win for public safety and business,"" Rockefeller said. ""Not only do businesses get the tax benefits associated with increased depreciation of capital expenses, but fire departments throughout West Virginia get a fighting chance to prevent the loss of life and property."" 
   Fire departments respond to a fire every 18 seconds. Every 60 seconds a fire breaks out in a commercial structure; and, every 80 seconds in a residential structure. According to the National Fire Protection Association, in 2005 fire departments responded to 1.6 million fires nationwide. In that same year, 3,675 people were killed and 17,925 people injured by fires in the United States. It's estimated that property losses due to fire are well over $80 billion dollars. 
   ""The devastating fire in Huntington underscored just how crucial it is to have the most fundamental safety precautions in place. It was a profound loss to the community and our entire state,"" said Rockefeller. ""In the event of a fire, sprinklers are crucial, especially for our older adults and younger children. It is my hope that Congress does its part by passing this bill, so that people are better protected in the future."" 
   Senator Rockefeller first cosponsored this legislation in 2005. The proposal has been endorsed by firefighters, the insurance industry, and general contractors.

  Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and other key Senate Democratic leaders and national security Committee Chairmen today urged the President to dramatically change the focus of his counter-terror strategy to address the crisis of terrorist safehavens in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   In addition to Chairman Rockefeller, signatories of the letter included Majority Leader Harry Reid, Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden, and Near East and South and Central Asian Affairs Subcommittee Chairman John Kerry. 
   The letter is attached:
   February 15, 2008
   The President
   The White House
  Washington, D.C.
   Dear Mr. President,
   We urge you in the strongest possible terms to focus your counter-terror strategy on the growing terrorist threat arising from the region along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the region where al-Qaida's senior leaders and foot soldiers operate freely. It is where our enemies are planning and training to attack us again. Safe havens exist in this region today. This region is, and has always been, the ""central front"" in our global battle against terrorists. 
   This fact could not be more clear. Last week, the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, testified to Congress that ""al-Qaida's central leadership based in the border area of Pakistan is [al-Qaida's] most dangerous component."" He testified that since mid-2006, there has been an influx of ""new Western recruits"" into this region, indicating that al-Qaida is ""improving the last key aspect of its ability to attack the United States: the identification, training, and positioning of operatives for an attack in the homeland."" This testimony echoed McConnell's first Congressional testimony as DNI in February 2007, when he warned that future attacks against the United States would most likely be planned from that region. It also echoed last July's declassified National Intelligence Estimate, which assessed that from its sanctuary in this border region, al-Qaida has regenerated the ""core operational capabilities"" necessary for attacks to our homeland. 
   Put simply, our national security depends on a counter-terror strategy that addresses the crisis of terrorist safe havens in this region. The warnings are stark. 
   In Pakistan, the tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December illustrated the expanding reach of terrorists in that country. The Islamist radicalism that was once largely confined to the isolated northwest of Pakistan is now pushing its influence deeper into the country. Pakistan's tumultuous domestic political and security situation is directly - and increasingly - related to our own counter-terror efforts. If Pakistan's parliamentary elections next week are not seen as free and fair by the population, it is possible that the country could devolve into ethnic and regional violence that would destabilize the country and the region, fuel the threat from Islamist terrorists operating in the region, and severely inhibit our counter-terror efforts in the region and worldwide. 
   Across the border in Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating as well, as detailed by three independent non-partisan reports last month. Afghanistan is larger in size and population than Iraq, but your administration's military and financial commitments to Afghanistan pale in comparison to those for Iraq. Not coincidentally, the Taliban has infiltrated and begun to control large swaths of territory in southern and southeastern Afghanistan, and, according to one of the studies, ""the prospect of again losing significant parts of Afghanistan to the forces of Islamic extremists has moved from the improbable to the possible."" This would have catastrophic consequences for our national security.
   For too long, U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have taken a back seat to Iraq. Admiral Mullen acknowledged as much in December, calling the Afghanistan mission an ""economy of force operation."" He said, ""It is simply a matter of resources, of capacity. In Afghanistan, we do what we can. In Iraq, we do what we must."" This is not acceptable.
   There are no easy answers to these problems, but the necessary first step is clear: to make us safe here at home, we must dramatically change the focus of our counter-terror strategy abroad and refocus on defeating our real terrorist enemies.
   Al-Qaida is our main enemy, and it is in al-Qaida's interest, not ours, for us to remain so focused on and entangled in Iraq's internal disputes to the detriment of our counter-terror efforts worldwide. As our Intelligence Community leaders have testified publicly and repeatedly, our massive military presence in Iraq actually inflames the terrorist threat from al-Qaida. Further, the continued diversion of military, intelligence, diplomatic and financial resources toward Iraq necessarily decreases the resources available to address the growing threat of terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This strategy must be reversed.
   Al-Qaida threatens us most directly from the terrorist safe havens along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan - not from Iraq - and it is long past time that our counter-terror strategy and national security posture reflected that vitally important fact. 
   Sincerely,
   Harry Reid (D-NV), Senate Majority Leader
   John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV), Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
   Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-DE), Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations
   Carl Levin (D-MI), Chairman, Committee on Armed Services

ROCKEFELLER CALLS WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN STATEMENT ON PROTECT AMERICA ACT LUDICROUS AND RECKLESS
  As Congress prepares to reconvene next week and address necessary permanent changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), Senator Rockefeller is encouraging the White House not to engage in a misinformation campaign that could hinder efforts to improve our national security programs.  
   In specific response to comments made by a White House spokesman yesterday, Senator Rockefeller made the following statement: 
   ""I understand the White House's desire to see legislation passed updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Indeed I share that goal. Inaccurate and inflammatory statements, however, are not going help the process. 
   ""The White House press spokesman's claim that if PPA expired terrorists would be 'free to make phone calls without fear of being surveilled by U.S. intelligence agencies' is ludicrous and reckless. To suggest that we will stop listening to terrorist communications on February 1 is not true. It is fear mongering at its worst.
   ""Vice Chairman Bond and I worked to craft bipartisan legislation that would make necessary improvements to FISA. I urge the President to instruct his staff to refrain from politicizing this issue and work constructively to pass this bill.""
   Rockefeller noted that the February 1 expiration of the Protect America Act (PPA) does not end the authority to collect intelligence. In fact, all other collection activities, including collection under other parts of FISA, are unaffected by the expiration of the PAA. United States intelligence agencies have always had, and will continue to have, the ability to collect communications intelligence from a variety of other sources. The Protect America Act is only one source of that authority. 
   Moreover, the PAA actually allows intelligence collection to continue until the certifications and directives made by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence expire. Thus, collection can continue until at least August, regardless of whether Congress passes an extension.

ROCKEFELLER HELPS PRESERVE FUNDING FOR WEST VIRGINIA FIRST RESPONDERS
  In the face of an effort by some big-state Senators to reduce homeland security grant funding for West Virginia and other small states, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) cosponsored a successful amendment to the FY 06 Senate Homeland Security Appropriations bill to preserve the current formula funding. The amendment will mean that West Virginia first responders will receive $8 million more next year than the state would have under the big-state proposal.  
   The Senate passed the Homeland Security bill last night, with Rockefeller voting for the bill. 
   ""The threats posed by al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups are real, and we have no way to accurately predict when or where they will attempt to attack us next,"" said Rockefeller. ""We cannot not afford a reduction in our homeland security funding. In West Virginia, our first responders, police, and firemen need more resources, not fewer. They are the backbone of our emergency preparedness, and we need to do more to help them help us."" 
   The amendment means that West Virginia and all other states will continue to receive either a base share of .55 percent of funds appropriated for state and local first responder programs or a base allocation derived from population and population density, with remaining funds distributed based on risk assessments. Under this formula, which was included in the Senate bill, West Virginia will receive approximately $10 million during FY 06. The proposal from big-state Senators would have reduced West Virginia's base share of the overall homeland security grant funding to .25 percent, leaving West Virginia first responders to divide less than $2 million. 
   Rockefeller also supported a number of other successful amendments in the bill that will improve West Virginia's homeland security, including: 
   * $52.6 million nationally for the U.S. Fire Administration
   * $50 million more nationwide for SAFER act grants to help communities hire additional firefighters and $20 million to improve interoperable communications. Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) introduced this amendment. 
   * Requiring localities throughout the country to use funds awarded through state and local grants, Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention grants, and Urban Area Security Initiative grants to be used according to each state's approved State Homeland Security Plan, as has been the policy of West Virginia since the first homeland security grants were made to states.
   * Requiring the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a formal survey of state and local emergency officials to assess federal agency performance, local need, and coordination efforts. The survey would enable adequate feedback from police, fire, medical, and emergency planners on the municipal, county, regional, and state levels.
   While he voted for the bill, Rockefeller also expressed concern that the Senate did not pass an amendment he cosponsored along with Senator Byrd to expand federal efforts to ensure rail and transit security by increasing federal funding in these areas by more than $1.4 billion. Another amendment that Rockefeller supported would have dramatically improved the safety of all Americans through the development of a Global Positioning System-based security system to monitor trucks that transport hazardous materials.
   ""Particularly at a time when we are still vulnerable to terrorism, we need to do more to make sure that we are as prepared as we can be,"" said Rockefeller.

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS TO PRESERVE MEDICAID
  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the future of Medicaid, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) questioned the merits of a National Governors Association (NGA) plan that would increase co-payments significantly for Medicare beneficiaries while simultaneously reducing Medicaid benefits. 
   ""Your plan targets the poorest, most vulnerable people in the country,"" Rockefeller, Chair of the Senate Democratic Working Group on Medicaid, told Governor Mark Warner (D-VA) and Governor Mike Huckabee (R-AK). ""Medicaid recipients are already paying, on a proportional basis, three times what people with private insurance pay in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It's absolutely unfair to burden them with higher co-payments. Medicaid is the only safety net they have."" 
   The NGA proposal recommends replacing Medicaid's nominal, cost-sharing amounts - which are no more than $3 per service and which exempt pregnant women and children. The new rules would allow states broad discretion to impose cost-sharing up to 5 percent of household income for families living at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. For families with incomes over 150 percent of the federal poverty level, the cap would be 7.5 percent. Such an increase would cost hundreds of dollars for families who don't have an ability to absorb the higher co-payments. Studies of some states show that even a modest premium increase causes beneficiaries to forego necessary medical care until a medical emergency sets in, which makes the needed care more expensive.
   Rockefeller also criticized the plan's suggestion for the elimination of basic benefit protection for children - the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. ""This benefit can make the difference between diagnosing and treating an illness that would otherwise go untreated, leaving many children unable to learn in school and develop in life,"" said Rockefeller. 
   Rockefeller even questioned the initial premise of efforts to reform Medicaid. ""I keep hearing that the problem is a policy issue, but I've said all along this is a budget issue. This administration has made budget choices - if we used the money for programs instead of making the tax cuts permanent, we could have cured Social Security until 2075 or we could have cured Medicare or we could have cured Medicaid. The administration has decided that the people who are the most vulnerable have the least ability to defend themselves and represent the best places to turn for budget cuts."" 
   Over the last thirty years, as Governor and then as Senator, Rockefeller has been a leader on Medicaid. He continues to fight against the dismantling of Medicaid. In the 109th Congress, Rockefeller has led the charge to reverse the administration's proposed $10 billion in cuts over four years. A bipartisan majority of House and Senate Members have voted to strike the Medicaid cuts, but the administration and the Republican congressional leadership continue to call for these cuts. 
   More than 350,000 West Virginians are Medicaid beneficiaries.

  Today, following an 11:20 a.m. ceremony, President Bush signed into law the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act, the most significant mine safety legislation since 1977. Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) co-authored the legislation. Sen. Byrd was on hand for the ceremony, along with members of the West Virginia delegation, Gov. Manchin, and miners and their families. Unfortunately, Sen. Rockefeller could not attend the signing ceremony due to his recovery from back surgery. 
   ""I'm so proud of what we all achieved today, but it is very much a bittersweet moment,"" said Rockefeller. ""Yes, we are celebrating the greatest improvements to mine safety in a generation. But we would not be here today if we had not suffered such tragic coal mine deaths earlier this year - 19 deaths in West Virginia alone and 33 nationwide.  
   ""It saddens me that we had to experience so much tragedy before we could accomplish change. But, we did achieve change - and hopefully the families are somewhat comforted by knowing that their loved ones have made a difference in the future safety of coal mining and that their loss will not be needlessly repeated. Mining will always be a dangerous profession, but the MINER Act will make it less dangerous and most importantly, it will undoubtedly save lives,"" Rockefeller said.
   ""This is a day of smiles and sadness for West Virginia. We are proud of the progress that this new law makes for mine safety, but saddened that it has taken the deaths of 19 of our coal miners to put these commonsense safety improvements into law,"" said Byrd. ""This new law will save lives. It will protect coal miners. It will mean tougher mine safety, better enforcement, and faster rescue in case tragedy strikes. 
   ""This new law - the MINER Law - is not the be-all and end-all for mine safety. We have more work to do. But the MINER Law takes important first steps to protect coal miners on the job, and to stop the terrible rash of mining deaths which have touched all of us so deeply this year,"" Byrd said.
   The MINER Act will: 
   * Double the amount of breathable air that each miner carries on them 
   * Establish additional breathable apparatus' for shelters in place and at 30 minute intervals along escape routes 
   * Create better communication - more telephone lines, new wireless technology, and electronic tracking of every miner 
   * Develop more and better-trained rescue teams - requiring a response within one hour 
   * Create higher minimum fines for serious health and safety violations 
   As the federal MINER Act was signed into law, Congress pushed forward with another important mine safety initiative, clearing more than $35 million for immediate emergency improvements in coal mines and to toughen safety enforcement. Byrd had included the $35.6 million in the national security emergency funding bill.
   The funds will allow many of the core initiatives of the federal MINER Act to begin immediately, such as pre-positioned oxygen supplies in mines and tougher enforcement of safety standards. The funds will also be used to begin to replace the more than 200 inspectors whose jobs have been eliminated by Bush Administration cuts during the past five years.
   ""Senate passage of this emergency mine safety funding completes an historic day for mine safety in America. These efforts will work in tandem to bring tighter safety enforcement and better rescue technologies to our mines,"" Byrd said.

ROCKEFELLER, KENNEDY FIGHT TO CORRECT WOUNDED SOLDIERS' PAY INEQUITY
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) have introduced legislation that would end the unjust military practice of cutting special combat pay and allowances for soldiers after they are injured in a combat zone and evacuated to recuperate.  
   ""I want to make sure that our soldiers receive the support they deserve,"" said Rockefeller, the senior Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. ""We should not cut the pay of injured soldiers when they are unable to work due to service-related injuries.""
   The Crosby-Puller Combat Wounds Compensation Act, named after Marine Corps Lance Corporal James Crosby and Lt. General Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller, would ensure that soldiers receive the same amount of compensation while recovering from their combat wounds as they did while in a combat zone. Without the additional combat pay, soldiers and their families are experiencing financial hardships due to travel, temporary housing, and wage loss as family members relocate to help with the recuperation of their hospitalized loved one. 
   ""Soldiers wounded in combat should continue to receive combat pay until they are discharged and are eligible for VA health care and other support services,"" said Rockefeller. ""From my home state of West Virginia, at least 27 soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have had their pay cut even though they are recuperating and waiting on a discharge to receive VA health care. These soldiers were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and we should not reduce their pay because they've been injured in that effort."" 
   ""Soldiers wounded in combat have already made great sacrifices,"" Kennedy said. ""We need to do everything possible to ease their recovery so that their families don't have to suffer further. James Crosby is a son of Massachusetts who has fought bravely on the battlefield, and he has brought that same determination to this legislation. He's an inspiration to us all."" 
   Rockefeller and Kennedy's Crosby-Puller Combat Wounds Compensation Act is a companion bill to H.R. 771, introduced by Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA). 
   In addition to extending the extra combat pay for soldiers, the Crosby-Puller Combat Wounds Compensation Act would repeal the two-year time limitation on the exclusion of combat zone compensation by reason of hospitalization due to wounds, disease, or injury incurred in a combat zone. 
   Crosby was wounded in 2004 during Operation Freedom in Iraq, and Puller is the most decorated Marine in Marine Corps history.

  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today attended the UMWA's unveiling of their report on the Sago Mine disaster on Capitol Hill. Also present were Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV), Rep. Nick Rahall (D-WV), Cecil Roberts, President of the UMWA, and family members of two of the miners who were lost during the Sago Mine tragedy last year.  
   ""Even with the benefit of time, I still feel the agony of the families who sit beside me,"" Rockefeller said. ""This report makes it clear we don't have all the answers. But I am grateful for the relentless efforts of the Sago families and UMWA to demand safer mines.""
   The UMWA-Sago report makes dozens of findings and recommendations in mine safety areas, ranging from seals to ventilation, dealing with methane accumulation, the donning and use of self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) oxygen packs, and national mine rescue preparedness.
   ""For me, the enduring lesson of the Sago disaster is that mine safety is not the responsibility of a few, but all of us, from miners to operators, state and local officials, federal agencies, and Congress,"" Rockefeller said. 
   Last year, Senator Rockefeller was instrumental in passing the MINER Act, the most comprehensive mine safety legislation in a generation. During his remarks he told the audience that there is still more work to do to ensure that miners have access to the latest, most modern life-saving technologies, from reserve air supplies, rescue chambers, and state-of-the-art communications systems. 
   Rockefeller noted that we developed technology that could put a man on the moon and communicate with him, but the communication system relied on by miners in an emergency is so old-fashioned that even Alexander Graham Bell would recognize it - and that while we can call all over the world with a cell phone, we haven't found a technology that can penetrate through the Earth to our mines. 
   Concluding his remarks, Senator Rockefeller thanked the UMWA for their diligent report. Later this month, Senator Rockefeller will join with his colleague, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) at hearing on the implementation of the MINER Act being held by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety. 
   The UMWA report is posted online at www.umwa.org.

ROCKEFELLER ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S PRIORITIES IN 110TH CONGRESS
  Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) has been selected to be the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when the Senate reconvenes in January under a Democratic majority. The following is Sen. Rockefeller's statement which reflects his key areas of focus for the committee in the next Congress.  
   ""The Intelligence Committee has an enormous responsibility to help guide and oversee the programs aimed at keeping Americans safe. It is a duty and a responsibility that I take very seriously. 
   ""As we look to the future and the challenges we face, we will only be successful if we recognize that intelligence is not the responsibility of one party or one branch of government - it is a shared responsibility. 
   ""The committee faces many critical and pressing issues that will have an effect on our national security in both the long and short-term. 
   ""To start with, the committee must look ahead to the next 10 years in the war on terror and insist that the United States Intelligence Community create a comprehensive, global counter-terrorism plan for the next decade. This strategy must be informed by a better understanding of emerging threat areas in Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and other parts of the Middle East. 
   ""We need to conduct an agency by agency review which will allow us to measure the implementation of the 2-year old intelligence reform legislation and recommend any necessary changes. 
   ""We must insist on full access to the NSA warrantless surveillance program and the CIA detention and interrogation program. Only then, can we conduct thorough oversight of these programs and determine whether they are legal, appropriate, and effective and what, if any, legislative action must be taken. 
   ""We need to put more of an emphasis on our ability to disrupt potential terrorist threats at home, which starts with addressing the missteps and slow transformation of the FBI. 
   ""We need to conduct a careful review of our counter-proliferation efforts, particularly against North Korea and Iran, and other rogue states. 
   ""Finally, as part of our core oversight responsibilities, the committee must complete its long-overdue, unfinished business, related to the use and misuse of intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq. 
   ""We have already put out three reports related to pre-war Intelligence on Iraq, and we will complete the three remaining sections of Phase II. No decisions have been made about the timing and process going forward, but our goal has always been to tell the full story about the role of intelligence and the mistakes that were made in the lead up to the war.""

ROCKEFELLER MEETS WITH SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA ANTI-DRUG COALITIONS
  In a meeting with West Virginia representatives of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) this week reiterated his opposition to President Bush's proposed elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools State Grants program. These community leaders from southern West Virginia have used the grants from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program to prevent drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse across the region. 
   At that meeting in Rockefeller's Washington office were Greg Pucket, of Mercer County Drug-Free Communities; Lisa Snedegar, Greenbrier County IMPACT Coalition; Robin Brown, Nicholas County CEASE Coalition, Donald Reed, Raleigh County SHAPED Coalition; Christy Lester, McDowell County FACES Coalition; and April Hall, Mercer County Wade Center.
   ""These advocates have been critical in helping our families and communities fight substance abuse,"" said Rockefeller, who created the Safe and Drug-Free School State Grants program almost twenty years ago. ""They need these grants to continue our work in fighting against the tragic effect that drugs, alcohol, and tobacco have on our children.
   ""It doesn't make sense that the administration wants to cut these grants. The Safe and Drug-Free School Grants program has been critical in enabling us to fight substance abuse in children in southern West Virginia and across the state. The success that this program has had should be a reason to continue it, not end it. I will not stand by and let this administration cut off the support that these coalitions need in fighting the abuse of illegal drugs and the proliferation of youth violence in our schools and communities.""
   Since its inception, the Safe and Drug Free School State Grants program has provided hundreds of millions of dollars, including $346 million in grants last year, in funding to community leaders so they could introduce a variety of drug and violence prevention activities in their local schools, including counseling services, mentoring programs, conflict resolution, and curriculum development. The program, which is monitored by the Department of Education, has contributed to a 19% decline in youth drug abuse over the last four years.
   ""This administration's budget priorities are totally misguided,"" Rockefeller said. ""Protecting our children should be at the top of their priorities, yet their decisions represent an absolute disregard for the future of our children and the strength of our communities.

ROCKEFELLER'S STATEMENT ON SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S FAILURE TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO AUTHORIZE INVESTIGATION INTO NSA SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Today, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was scheduled to debate and vote on whether to authorize a committee investigation into the legal and operational aspects of the NSA warrantless surveillance program. Unfortunately, using a procedural maneuver, the Chairman prevented the Vice Chairman from offering and voting on his proposal which outlined key questions before the Committee. Prior to today's meeting, all Committee members had an opportunity to review the Vice Chairman's proposal and the Chairman had assured the Vice Chairman his proposal would be voted on.  
   The following is Senator Rockefeller's statement:
   ""Today, the Senate intelligence committee, once again, abdicated its responsibility to oversee the intelligence activities of the United States.
   ""For four years, the Administration has kept the existence of the President's warrantless surveillance program from the full committee. Since the program's disclosure two months ago, the Administration has continued to withhold essential details about the program's legality, scope, and application that they are required to provide the committee.
   ""Authorizing a committee investigation into the National Security Agency's surveillance and eavesdropping activities in the United States is necessary to fully understand the program. This is what the Senate intelligence committee was created to do.
   ""Our counterterrorism programs are too important to the country to allow them to be undermined by weak legal underpinnings. It is important for the long term effectiveness of the war on terror that these programs have the full support of both branches of government.
   ""It is apparent to me that the White House has applied heavy pressure in recent weeks to prevent the committee from doing its job. Although some members of this committee indicate they need more time to decide on what action to take, I believe this is another stalling tactic.
   ""There will be no shortage of legislative fixes offered in coming weeks to address the legal shortcomings of the President's warrantless surveillance program and many of these proposals will undoubtedly be at odds with each other. The Senate intelligence committee has a unique and constructive role to play in guiding and informing this debate, while respecting the sensitivity of this and other intelligence collection programs.
   ""No member of the Senate can cast an informed vote on legislation authorizing, or conversely restricting, the NSA's warrantless surveillance program when they fundamentally do not know what they are authorizing or restricting.
   ""My proposal seeking a committee investigation included a report no later than May 15th on recommended ways of bringing the program into compliance with the law.
   ""For the past three years, the Senate intelligence committee has avoided carrying out its oversight of our nation's intelligence programs whenever the White House becomes uncomfortable with the questions being asked.
   ""The very independence of this committee is called into question as we are continually prevented from having a full accounting of pre-war intelligence on Iraq, the CIA's detention, interrogation, and rendition program, and, now, the NSA's warrantless surveillance and eavesdropping program.
   ""If we are prevented from fully understanding and evaluating the NSA program, our committee will continue its slide into irrelevance.""

ROCKEFELLER MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF E-RATE IN WEST VIRGINIA
  In anticipation of the 10-year anniversary of the E-Rate program, Sen. Jay Rockefeller will join with West Virginians to celebrate local efforts to bridge the digital divide. In West Virginia, more than $80 million in E-Rate funding has helped schools and libraries pay for the cost of linking to the Internet.  
   ""The E-rate has helped to bring all West Virginians on to the information superhighway. A resource to develop lifelong skills, E-rate provides Internet access to children in school and beyond the classroom and to people of all ages at public libraries,"" Rockefeller said. ""With a push of a button, we can keep in touch with loved ones serving in our military overseas, teach our children about world events, promote our businesses, and encourage tourism to our state.""  
   Ten years ago, Senator Rockefeller coauthored the legislation that established the E-Rate program, or more precisely, the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Fund. E-Rate provides discounts to schools and libraries to obtain enhanced telecommunication services and access to the Internet. Discounts can range from 20 to 90 percent depending on local economic conditions and if the community is considered urban or rural.  
   During the last decade, the number of schools connected to the Internet has grown from 14 to 92 percent nationwide; during that same time, the number of least affluent schools online has grown from 5 to 89 percent. 
   ""Education and technology go hand-in-hand,"" Rockefeller said. ""As a nation, we have a responsibility to ensure that all of our people reap the benefits of the information age so that we are prepared to meet the economic challenges of the 21st Century."" 
   Next week, Senator Rockefeller will be traveling to libraries and schools in Harrison, Wood and Wirt Counties to help showcase how information technology is making a difference in West Virginia. Additionally, on February 27, Senator Rockefeller, along with Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and former Senator Bob Kerry (D-NE) will be honored at the E-Rate's 10th anniversary gala in Washington, D.C.  
   Rockefeller has closely monitored this program in the years since he first co-authored the program and is reintroducing a bill to protect the long-term future of the Universal Service Fund, which includes E-Rate, to ensure that funding continues to flow to schools and libraries across the state.

Last year, the community approached the Senator to get his help in urging the company to create a plan to develop the unused land in the city.  
   ""Today's announcement by Mittal is great and welcome news for all of us who have been looking to attract jobs and investments to the Northern Panhandle. Given the breadth and depth of the land that's available for sale, it will clearly make it easier for us to continue to market and promote Weirton as great place to do business. 
   ""As we've seen across the country in other steel communities, the possibilities for this land are endless. While this economic renaissance in Weirton won't happen overnight, I'm confident that working together we'll be able to find the right projects that will benefit fromour hard working and productive workforce.
   ""Let me also be equally clear, this is not the end of steel in West Virginia. Quite the contrary, tin remains very valuable and changes within the industry are providing new opportunities for West Virginia steel workers. This is not the end, it's a new beginning.""
   Rockefeller noted that the Discover the REAL West Virginia Foundation is planning on hosting a summit to discuss the redevelopment options in Weirton this spring. The Foundation is currently working to coordinate the schedules of all the stakeholders so that we can have a productive and frank discussion about our development options.

ROCKEFELLER WINS VICTORY ON CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY
  In an effort to speed the development and use of clean coal technologies, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) successfully included in the landmark Energy bill an amendment to increase the number of coal-fired plants using advanced clean coal technologies. According to estimates by industry officials and the Department of Energy, Rockefeller's amendment could jumpstart the construction of 12 or more state-of-the-art clean coal plants. The new plants would generate a greater demand for one of West Virginia's most valuable resources, while improving the environmental performance of the nation's electricity sector.  
   ""This amendment will lead to immediate results in the development of clean coal plants,"" Rockefeller said. ""We've heard from experts in both West Virginia and Washington that, twenty years from now, we can have an entire fleet of near-zero emission coal-fired power plants. But to be where we want to be in twenty years, we need to have a concentrated deployment of these essential technologies now. 
   ""These plants will be good for West Virginia. They will be good for our miners, the Appalachian coal industry, our utilities, and our environment."" 
  Rockefeller's amendment increases the cap on clean coal generation megawatts eligible for a 20% investment tax credit by 1000 megawatts to 7500 megawatts. The additional capacity will enable energy companies and tax-exempt entities planning new plants to bring online 6 or more new integrated gasification combined cycle generation facilities and a similar number of new advanced combustion facilities. 
   ""This effort will encourage the innovation and know-how that will enable us to use the abundant energy sources we already have in this country, rather than continuing our dependence on foreign sources of energy,"" said Rockefeller.
   The Rockefeller amendment was accepted in a Senate Finance Committee markup of the tax provisions that will become a part of the Energy bill. They will be added as a Finance Committee package offered on the Senate floor. The Senate is expected to finish its debate on the Energy bill by the end of next week. 
   Rockefeller also told committee members that he will continue to push for a credit on the capture of coal mine methane and a credit to promote oil and gas production from non-conventional sources.

ROCKEFELLER BILL ON INDECENCY SPURS ACTION IN CONGRESS TO INCREASE FINES ON TV INDECENCY
  In response to an epidemic of gratuitous and excessive acts of indecency on TV, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) praised the enactment of a bill introduced by Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS) to increase fines on incidents such as the infamous 2004 Super Bowl incident from $32,500 to $325,000. The action is part of a broader effort, led by Sen. Rockefeller, to make sure that proper controls are placed on indecent television programming - both episodes of gratuitous violence and graphic sex. 
   Rockefeller's own indecency legislation, The Indecent and Gratuitous and Excessively Violent Programming Control Act of 2005, calls for increasing potential fines as high as $500,000. It also promotes a broader approach to tackling indecency on television. The bill would add gratuitous and excessive television violence to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s definition of indecency. The bill would also broaden the FCC's monitoring of indecency from network television to cable and satellite. Overall, Rockefeller's bill would give parents a greater control of what their children are watching.  
   ""Increasing fines is an important way to tell broadcasters that we are serious about taking action against indecent material,"" Rockefeller said. ""For the sake of our children, we are not going to tolerate indecency, which seems to appear at all hours of the day on more TV channels than ever. We know from numerous studies that such gratuitous and graphic programming negatively affect our children.
   ""But it's not enough to increase fines. We need to take on this problem in a truly comprehensive and systematic way that will enable us to diminish the appetite that television producers have for producing shows full of sex and violence. Instead of merely reacting to one or two high profile incidents, we need to preempt these incidents by fundamentally transforming the culture of programming. Only then will we be able to give parents more control of what their children are watching.""
   ""That's what West Virginia parents want. I hear over and over from them that they are very concerned about what their children are watching. I believe we have a moral imperative to meet this issue head on."" 
   Key features Senator Rockefeller's legislation include: 
   * Providing the FCC with the authority, for the first time, to address graphic and gratuitous violence on television.
   * Directing FCC to address violence and indecency on all TV programming, including cable and satellite.
   * Increasing fines for indecent content.
   * Doubling children's programming from 3-6 hours per week.
   Giving greater flexibility to local broadcasters and parents to reject offensive programming. 
   Rockefeller's bill enjoys wide support from a variety of groups, including: Parents Television Council, Benedum Foundation, Children Now, Children's Media Policy Coalition, Kaiser Family Foundation, National Association for Family and Community Education, National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families, and the National Institute on Family and the Media.
   The Brownback bill was signed into law by the President yesterday. Rockefeller will continue to fight to have his bill heard before the Senate Commerce Committee and ultimately the entire Senate.
   Senator Rockefeller has been a long-time supporter of legislation to address indecency. He voted for the Children's Television Act of 1990, which limited the amount of advertising during children's television shows. In 2004, he supported the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which would have sharply increased the amount of fines for these broadcasters.

ROCKEFELLER SEEKS TO RESTORE FUNDING TO FIGHT GROWING METHAMPHETAMINE CRISIS
  Pointing to the president's proposed $1.6 billion cut in federal funding for first responder services as a ""major blow to our efforts to deal with the surge of methamphetamine use and manufacturing,"" Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) this week co-sponsored an amendment to restore funding for local police, firefighters and homeland security initiatives.  
   ""Cutting funding for our police officers and others who must be trained, equipped, and prepared to react to local emergencies jeopardizes the safety of the people of West Virginia,"" Rockefeller said. 
   ""The methamphetamine problem is particularly serious because it not only endangers the user, but also those who manufacture it, the people who live in the homes where it is made, and even those who live nearby,"" Rockefeller said. ""Its effect on innocent children has been particularly cruel. We must do everything possible to protect our communities. This is not a time to let our guard down."" 
   ""I discussed some of these funding issues last week with Jim Spears, our new Secretary of Military Affairs and Public Safety in West Virginia. The West Virginia legislature is moving to restrict the access to some of the ingredients needed to manufacture methamphetamine, and I know people at the local level are working very hard on this issue. Cutting their funding now would pull the rug out from under them."" 
   If the Bush budget cuts proposed are ratified, local groups like the Metro Drug Enforcement Network Team, which is responsible for most of the methamphetamine lab cleanup in Kanawha and Putman counties, would lose about two-thirds of their budget, seriously restricting their efforts. Other drug task forces around the state would face similar challenges. 
   Last year, communities received over $485 million through the COPS program to help put more police on the street. Firefighters received another $226 million through the FIRE Act, which Sen. Rockefeller co-sponsored. The COPS program, Byrne Justice Assistance grants, firefighter grants and Urban Area Security Initiative grants are among the many grants funded through the Department of Homeland Security. The President's budget would drastically reduce funding for these grant programs.

ROCKEFELLER, BYRD WIN SENATE FIGHT FOR GREATER MINE SAFETY
  After a number of weeks of intense negotiations with parties representing all aspects of the mining industry, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) today announced that they have reached agreement on a comprehensive Senate mine safety bill that could bring about the most sweeping mine safety changes in a generation. Created in the wake of mine tragedies that have killed 18 West Virginia miners in 2006, The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act) calls for substantial increases in oxygen supplies for miners, better tracking devices, better trained rescue team, and revamps mine rescue rules to better ensure a more rapid response in the event of an accident. 
   The bill, which is sponsored by Senators Rockefeller, Byrd, Enzi (R-WY), Kennedy (D-MA), Murray (D-WA), and Isakson (R-GA) is expected to be considered by the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee tomorrow before being sent to the Senate floor for a vote. The new legislation includes some of the core principles contained in the West Virginia Congressional Delegation's mine safety legislation, introduced in February. 
   ""The MINER Act represents the most groundbreaking development in mine safety legislation in a generation,"" said Rockefeller. ""This bill will usher in a new era of safety for our mines. For the first time, we will be better able to address an accident before it occurs, not simply react to it. And when accidents happen - and, unfortunately, they will because coal mining is dangerous - we will now be able to employ the most advanced technology to bring miners back to safety and to their families. All of the Senators who worked on this bill put the interests of West Virginia miners and the coal industry first - they have visited Sago, they have talked to the families, and they have kept these memories uppermost in their minds as we have drafted this visionary legislation.""
   ""Already this year, 18 coal miners have lost their lives in West Virginia. We must make sure that those deaths are not in vain. We have a moral obligation to apply the lessons from these mine accidents, to enforce tough safety standards, and to prevent other miners from losing their lives,"" Byrd stated. ""The status quo is not good enough; the status quo is putting lives at risk. The MINER Act is a strong step forward for our coal miners.""
   The MINER Act carves out new agreements between mine workers and industry officials on issues critical to mine safety. The bill requires each miner to have at least 2 hours of oxygen and stores of oxygen every 30 minutes along escape routes. The bill also requires coal operators to submit plans detailing their mine's use of the most current communications, tracking, and breakthrough technologies - and they must, upon acceptance of their new safety evacuation plans, use the best technology that works in their mines. Within three years, all mines would have state-of-the-art two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place. 
   In the event of an accident, operators would be required to make an incident notification within 15 minutes. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of up to $60,000. The MINER Act also requires two rescue teams familiar with each mine to be located within one hour travel time. A trained family liaison will be brought in by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to provide guidance and counseling for miners' families and to serve as a conduit of information to the press and public. 
   The bill also calls for substantial increases to the current fine structure, including increasing the penalty for the most egregious violations to $220,000 and also for stricter enforcement of those fines. A larger inspector workforce would be created through mine safety scholarships, and MSHA will now have the power to initiate a shutdown of a mine that refuses to pay its fines. 
   Finally, the bill calls for the creation of the Office of Mine Safety in the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to develop and implement new technologies to be used for mine safety applications. After additional study, the Secretary of Labor could push for the use of refuge chambers for underground coal mines. 
   ""The MINER Act will save the lives of coal miners, plain and simple. Another fatal tragedy could happen anytime. We've got to act now to protect our coal miners and our coalfield communities,"" Byrd explained. ""Coal miners deserve the best protections and the best safety enforcement possible. This legislation will help to meet that goal.""
   ""When I went to Sago and Aracoma in January, I said that we would introduce serious legislation to help ensure that another Sago never happened again,"" said Rockefeller. ""I said then that it wouldn't be fast, and I said then that it wouldn't be easy. But I did say that we would be diligent and thorough, armed with a long view of protecting miners for generations to come. The MINER Act is the culmination of those efforts. Now, we must work to make sure that our colleagues in both the Senate and the House move on this critical legislation. Truly, thousands of lives depend on our actions."" 
   A 1-page summary follows.
   THE MINER (MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE) ACT 
   BREATHABLE AIR: Miners will have more emergency breathing devices to help them survive a disaster. The bill:
   * Requires each miner to have at least 2 hours of breathable air and stores of breathing devices every 30 minutes along escape routes for miners trying to evacuate.
   * Emergency supplies will be carefully monitored for reliability.
   BETTER COMMUNICATIONS AND TRACKING: State-of-the-art technology. The bill:
   * States that all mines will have state-of-the-art two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking systems in place, as soon as technologically feasible, but not later than three years from enactment.
   BETTER RESCUE EFFORTS: Mine rescue team response will be faster and better. The bill: 
   * Requires rescue teams to be located close to the mines they cover and be familiar with those mines. 
   * Includes special provisions for small mines that are realistic, but also provide a higher level of protection for their miners than under current law.
   * Clarifies that neither rescue team members nor their employers are liable for any injuries or deaths that occur as a result of rescue activities.
   STEEPER FINES: The Secretary will have new enforcement powers. The bill: 
   * Sets substantial new minimum penalties for serious violations.
   * Gives the Secretary clear authority to shut down a mine for noncompliance with Department orders.
   ENCOURAGES NEW INSPECTORS: The bill encourages technological advances and a new generation of skilled miners and safety inspectors. The bill:
   * Focuses the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'s mine safety activities and creates an interagency working group to facilitate development of new technologies.
   * Directs expert study on belt-air and flammability of belts and field tests of refuge chambers.
   * Creates a grant program to improve safety training.
   * Creates a scholarship program to increase the skilled workforce for mining operations, the inspector corps, and more safety research for institutions of higher learning.
   ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BILL: 
   All mines will have flame resistant lifelines to guide miners out in an emergency.
   Seals for abandoned sections of mines will be stronger. Within 18 months, the Secretary must issue a higher standard for sealing off abandoned areas of mines to prevent dangerous explosions.

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS TO HEALTH CARE IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS
  In an effort to protect workers' and retirees' health care from being eliminated by bankrupt companies, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today introduced the Health Benefit Protection Act (HBPA). Both in West Virginia and across the country, companies such as Horizon Natural Resources have used bankruptcy to rid themselves of health insurance for their workers and retirees. Rockefeller's bill would give workers an opportunity to access company assets by creating a trust that would preserve some health care benefits.  
   ""This bill is an effort to stop companies from breaking the promises they have made to their workers about health care,"" said Rockefeller. ""Under current law, workers are at the back of the line when creditors are paid. Sadly, a company that sold a bag of rock dust to a mine last month has a greater claim in bankruptcy court than a retired miner who put in 40 years underground. That's unacceptable.
   ""I introduced this legislation because we must do everything possible to make sure that there are no more Horizons,"" Rockefeller said. ""I will continue to work with the United Mine Workers on reforms that will make a meaningful improvement in our bankruptcy laws. Together, we must find a way to deliver relief to working families who worry every day that they may lose their hard-earned benefits."" 
   Rockefeller's legislation would give workers a ""priority claim"" on the sale of company assets. Any revenue generated from company assets would be placed in a trust to maintain workers' health care. HPBA would also increase from $4,650 to $15,000 the back-pay, vacation time, severance, or benefit payments workers can claim. In addition, the bill would recover excessive payouts made to company executives or insiders just before declaring bankruptcy.
   In August, a judge ruled that bankrupt Horizon could terminate health insurance for its more than 800 workers and over 2,300 retirees. The company has about 200 workers and 500 retirees in West Virginia. Last month, 2,000 miners gathered in Smithers to protest the Horizon bankruptcy.
   HPBA represents Rockefeller's ongoing effort to protect workers from unfair bankruptcy laws. In 2003, Rockefeller introduced the Bankruptcy Fairness Act, which called for employees to receive 18 months of comparable health care if a company eliminated health coverage.

ROCKEFELLER, SNOWE HAIL VICTORY ON MAINTAINING AFFORDABLE TELEPHONE SERVICE FOR CONSUMERS, INTERNET FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES
  Working to make sure that America's students, library patrons, and rural telephone consumers continue to receive affordable telecommunications, the Senate agreed today to a 1-year exemption of arcane budget rules for the popular Universal Service Fund (USF). Thanks to this exemption, the USF can maintain the E-Rate, which provides discounted Internet service to thousands of American schools and libraries. Without today's action, phone bills could have spiked beginning in January or E-Rate discounts schools and libraries would have been disrupted.  
   Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV) and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) created E-Rate as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.
   ""This is an important victory for our schools, our libraries, and our rural consumers,"" said Rockefeller. ""The Universal Service Fund and E-Rate specifically have brought about a revolution, bringing the digital age to every corner of our country. Today marks a significant victory, but Senator Snowe and I will push for a more permanent resolution of this issue next year."" 
   ""The Senate has rightly included a provision in the CJS appropriations bill to help schools and libraries around the country stay connected Internet service while preventing potential increases in consumer phone bill fees,"" said Snowe. ""Working closely with Senator Rockefeller, we have successfully ensured that until a permanent fix is crafted, the status quo is preserved for another year to allow schools and libraries to receive their Internet funding and keep consumers' telephone bills from rising. This is merely a short-term solution to a problem that must be solved. I pledge to continue to fight for a permanent solution to ensure that neither our residential nor business phone bills rise.""
   In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) imposed new accounting rules on USF, which resulted in suspending the E-Rate program for several months, disrupting service to schools and libraries last fall. In response to the FCC action, Members of Congress passed a short-term exemption to the budget rules in one of the very last actions of the 108th Congress. 
   Today's action, which was part of the FY 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill conference report, extended that provision for another year by exempting USF from the Anti-Deficiency Act (ADA). Under that exemption, E-Rate will be able to issue new commitment letters based on future revenue, not according to the cash-on-hand rules imposed by the FCC. 
   In February, Rockefeller and Snowe introduced S.241, which would provide USF with a permanent ADA exemption.
   E-Rate has been an enormous success story. In 1996, only 14% of America's schools and libraries had Internet access. As of 2003, 93% were wired. A September 2004 Government Accountability Office report showed that rural school systems have used E-Rate to meet No Child Left Behind accountability mandates.
   The Commerce-Justice-Science bill now goes to the President, where it is expected to be signed into law.

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS TO KEEP FOREIGN COMPANIES FROM DUMPING STEEL ON WEST VIRGINIA MARKET
  In an effort to protect West Virginia steel manufacturers against foreign steel companies that receive subsidies from their own governments, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) today urged the International Trade Commission (ITC) to preserve the existing antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on corrosion-resistant products. Many West Virginia steel jobs depend on the preservation of these orders.  
   Rockefeller plans to testify at tomorrow's ITC hearing on the review of these orders. 
   ""I refuse to stand back and watch our steel companies become victims again of unfair trade practices,"" said Rockefeller. ""Since this ITC decision in the 1990s, West Virginia steelworkers have fought to recover from years of illegal steel dumping on our markets. The record shows that foreign producers will seize the advantage and dump again."" 
   If the ITC decides to lift the AD/CVD orders, it would mean that West Virginia companies will be forced to compete against foreign steelmakers who benefit from subsidies provided by their own governments.
   ""These ITC orders have helped to level the playing field for American steel companies,"" said Rockefeller. ""If the ITC backpedals now, we could be back at square one. West Virginia would face a surge of steel imports propped up by illegal foreign subsidies. We cannot let that happen."" 
   In advance of tomorrow's hearing, Rockefeller, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) and a bipartisan group of 14 other senators wrote ITC Chairman Daniel Pearson, demanding that the orders be preserved: ""we urge you to strongly enforce U.S. trade laws and ensure that unfair trade does not return to this market.""
   ""Our trade laws are designed for this precise purpose,"" the Senators wrote. ""They seek to ensure that success in the U.S. market is the result of hard work and innovation, not market-distorting government practices. It is unrealistic to expect U.S. companies, which must compete for capital in an open market, to survive over the long run against foreign companies that are propped up by government subsidies or closed home markets.""

The group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE) - includes national and West Virginia companies from electricity generation, transportation, coal production, energy technology, and equipment manufacturing. The companies announced today that they are committing themselves to support an integrated solution to climate change concerns, including potentially a mandatory cap and trade program. 
   Senator Rockefeller's statement is below:
   ""Today's announcement by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE) is a strong and necessary step in the right direction. 
   ""ACCCE's principles and mission statement make clear that this group of key stakeholders is serious about harnessing both the challenges and benefits of responsible climate change measures. These companies clearly recognize the importance of deploying technologies that will achieve long-term sustainability for clean coal, the nation's most abundant energy resource. And, they recognize the need to address economic concerns facing both citizens and elected officials in implementing carbon control strategies.
   ""I think we have more talking to do, but I look forward to working with ACCCE, and members of Congress, to build consensus around responsible and viable climate legislation. I am confident that, together, we can craft legislation that will achieve the universal goals of protecting the environment and our economic prosperity.""

   ""Our hearts go out to the families of the mine rescue team members who lost their lives last night in the Crandall Canyon mine in Utah. I've long believed that Americans don't fully appreciate the brave men and women who go underground every day to provide the coal our nation needs.

   ""Like firefighters who run into burning buildings, mine rescue team members know that the environment they're heading into is dangerous, and may already have cost others their lives. The miners who became rescue team members and were killed last night volunteered for this duty. The MSHA employee was there because he was a dedicated public servant. The three men who died, and the other rescue team members who were injured, are part of a brotherhood that few probably understand, but which Americans should deeply respect. 
   ""The whole world has focused on the miners trapped in this mine, and although this new chapter in the tragedy hits home in the canyons of Utah, I hope the families of the original six miners and the families and coworkers of the men who lost their lives can take some solace in the prayers that are coming their way today from the coalfields of West Virginia.""

ROCKEFELLER PROPOSAL FOR COAL-TO-LIQUID DEVELOPMENT
  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) announced today that the U.S. Senate has endorsed a proposal to keep the development of coal-to-liquids (CTL) technology advancing in the right direction. The measure was included as part of the 2007 Farm Bill that passed the Senate late Friday night by a vote of 79-14. 
   ""There is no single alternative fuel source that will address our growing energy needs and lessen our dependence on foreign energy. The responsible use of clean coal to meet our electricity and transportation needs must be in the mix,"" Rockefeller said. ""The overwhelming support of the Senate sends a clear message: Coal conversion is a technology worth investing in. But along with tax credits, we need to go one step further and begin a substantial federal government investment - along the lines of the Manhattan Project - to begin researching and developing a workable solution for carbon capture and sequestration.""
   Specifically, Rockefeller measure extends the alternative fuel tax credit for CTL development for three more years. To qualify, developers will need to demonstrate that they can capture 50 percent of the carbon emissions from a CTL facility over the next two years; then 75 percent by 2010. The Farm Bill is a major agricultural assistance bill that included tax incentives aimed at spurring rural development that includes tax incentives aimed at other alternative fuel research, such as ethanol and other biofuels, natural gas and wind power. Earlier this year, Senator Rockefeller worked with his colleagues on the Finance Committee to win a similar endorsement for this plan.
   Senator Rockefeller has long-supported efforts that would promote CTL development and believes CTL can and must meet high environmental standards. Currently, he's working on legislation that would create a Future Fuels Corporation - a large scale joint government and private effort to finally solve carbon capture. Rockefeller noted that the ability to capture industrial carbon emissions will be the challenge of the coming decades and is crucial to addressing the problem of global climate change.
   Rockefeller also promoted CTL development in legislation he authored earlier this year to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. The Senator is advocating for the creation of a national center of excellence to develop coal-to-jet fuel technologies. Rockefeller noted that several countries around the world already use fuels derived from coal with great success - and the U.S. military has some projects underway, specifically, the Air Force is already testing the use of coal-based jet fuels.
   The Farm Bill now goes to the U.S. House of Representatives for its consideration.

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS AGAINST RAILROAD MONOPOLIES
  In an effort to make sure that West Virginia companies are not held hostage by monopolistic railroads that are unfairly compromising their ability to compete, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is pressing his colleagues to pass legislation to increase competitiveness in the nation's freight railroad industry. That legislation would not only help companies, but it would help drive down prices for consumers with products and services across the spectrum. 
   In West Virginia, companies such as Bayer, American Electric Power, Dow, and Mittal have struggled to get the fair shipping prices they should receive. Another large West Virginia employer, Toyota, has experienced monopoly shipping prices in other states.
   ""This is a matter of fairness - for both our businesses in West Virginia and for our families,"" said Rockefeller. ""No one can ignore the fact that this monopoly abuse is hurting companies that are trying to play fair, and no one should deny that the ultimate victim of these practices is the American consumer. Very few products we buy are unaffected by the railroads' unjust practices.""
   Rockefeller noted that the predatory changes make agricultural products, electricity, and chemicals - staples in Americans' everyday lives - more expensive.
   Rockefeller's bill, The Railroad Competition Act of 2005, would lower transportation costs by promoting rail competition. Even though the bill enjoys bipartisan support in both houses of Congress, lobbying by the railroad industry has delayed action on the bill. Nevertheless, Rockefeller senses that momentum is building to end the various monopoly abuses by the nation's largest freight railroads.
   ""I am encouraged by the number of Senators who have become interested in this issue,"" Rockefeller said. ""These practices affect every part of our country - rural America and urban America, the Grain Belt and the Coalfields, and all corners of our country. We haven't succeeded yet in stopping these practices, but we will.""

   The fiscal year 2007 Intelligence Authorization bill covers a wide-range of issues, including steps to: 
   * Enable the DNI to fund information sharing efforts that span the Intelligence Community;
   * Establish a pilot program to encourage and improve information sharing between the Intelligence Community and non-intelligence agencies for the purposes of collecting intelligence on counterterrorism or weapons of mass destruction;
   * Elevate the directors of the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to require Senate confirmation for these positions;

   ""Quality air service is essential to these communities, and I am glad that the Department of Transportation recognized this need,"" Rockefeller said. ""The EAS program was created to help communities like Beckley, Bluefield, and Princeton, and I am sure that southern West Virginians will put this new air service to good use."" 
   The airports will be served by the 19-seat Beech 1900 aircraft and will be operated by Colgan Air, a regional affiliate of US Airways Express. After community input, the DOT approved a new EAS agreement that increases the number of flights per week to Columbus and Dulles International. This new service replaces flights previously going to Pittsburgh. 
   Rockefeller, who has been a long-time supporter of the EAS program, is continuing to fight for the program's existence. Earlier this year, the Bush Administration announced its plan to cut the program entirely in its Fiscal Year 2005 budget. On June 4, Rockefeller and several other senators wrote Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation/Treasury and General Government. In the letter, the senators urged her to provide the full amount of funding needed for the EAS program to continue providing air service to rural communities in West Virginia and throughout the United States in the Senate's FY 2005 appropriations package. 
   ""As you know, small and rural communities are the first to bear the brunt of bad economic times and the last to see the benefits of good times,"" the senators wrote. ""We are requesting that the Appropriations Committee provide $127 million for the Essential Air Service program and $35 million for the Small Community Development program. The federal government must provide sufficient resources and tools for small and rural communities to help them attract adequate air service. By funding these programs at their authorized levels, Congress will have taken invaluable steps to improve rural communities' ability to compete in a changing economy.""

MURKOWSKI PRAISES EXTENSION OF FMAP MATCHING RATE
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced that the state will continue to maintain its Medicaid Assistance matching rate. Signed into law by President Bush earlier this week, S.1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, included provisions that will allow Alaska to continue to receive a higher matching rate from the federal government. 
   The two year extension of Alaska's Federal Medicaid Assistance Program (FMAP) rate at 57.58 percent means that the state will receive approximately an additional $130 million in federal Medicaid funding for FY06 and FY07.
   ""The vital federal funding provided for FMAP in the Deficit Reduction Act will greatly assist the state in meeting the healthcare needs of Alaskans,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Our geography and limited transportation infrastructure translate into healthcare costs that are far higher than the rest of the country. With the signing of this act into law, the Alaskans most in need will continue to receive important healthcare services and supplies.""
   The language included in the deficit reduction bill, originally introduced by Murkowski as free standing legislation (S.159), requires the government to recognize Alaska's higher costs of medical care when dispensing federal Medicaid funds and provides a two year extension of the higher matching rate originally obtained by the Alaska Delegation in 1997.
   Calculated on the basis of per-capita income, the Medicaid formula does not take into consideration Alaska's high health care costs, which are caused principally by higher transportation costs. Alaska's health care costs are 70 percent higher than those in states in the Lower 48. Twenty percent of Alaskans are Medicaid eligible, which is significantly higher than the national average of 12 percent.

MURKOWSKI REINTRODUCES CAPE FOX LEGISLATION
  Senator Lisa Murkowski has reintroduced legislation to resolve certain conveyances and provide for alternative land selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act related to Cape Fox Corporation and Sealaska Corporation. The bill, S.203, enables the Cape Fox Corporation, representing the Native people of Saxman, to finalize its land entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).  
   Under ANCSA, Cape Fox Corporation is required to take conveyance to approximately 160 acres of unusable land in mountainous terrain. The legislation would relieve Cape Fox of its obligation to take this unusable land. The legislation would permit Cape Fox Corporation to receive 99 acres of land which adjoin their existing holdings instead of the 160 unusable acres. 
   ""Clearly, Cape Fox was placed on unequal economic footing relative to other village corporations in Southeast Alaska,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Despite its best efforts during the years since ANCSA was signed into law, Cape Fox has been unable to overcome the disadvantage the law built into its land selection opportunities by this inequitable treatment. It is my hope that this legislation will provide the remedies needed to help address this longstanding inequity."" 
   Cape Fox Corporation is an Alaskan Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, by the Native Village of Saxman, near Ketchikan. As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under Section 16. However, unlike other village corporations, Cape Fox was further restricted from selecting lands within 6 miles of the boundary of the home rule city of Ketchikan. All other ANCSA corporations were restricted from selecting within 2 miles of such a home rule of city. 
   The 6-mile restriction went beyond protecting Ketchikan's watershed and damaged Cape Fox by preventing the corporation from selecting valuable timber lands, industrial sites, and other commercial property, not only in its core township, but in surrounding lands far removed from Ketchikan and its watershed. As a result of the 6-mile restriction, only the mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core township, which is nonproductive and of no economic value, was available for selection by the corporation. Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation affected by this restriction.

MURKOWSKI, STEVENS REINTRODUCE MEASURE TO PROTECT GROUNDWATER, AID FLOOD FORECASTS, PROVIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens recently reintroduced legislation requiring the federal government to fund a comprehensive study of water resources in Alaska, including an effort to map aquifers in populated Southcentral Alaska that increasingly supplies well water for tens of thousands of Alaskans.  
   Murkowski, in her past role as chairman of the Senate Water and Power Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, originally introduced the Alaska Water Resources Act of 2005 with her Alaska colleague Senator Ted Stevens. While the bill passed the Senate, time ran out in the 109th Congress before it was acted upon in the House. 
   Specifically, the legislation: ? Authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to determine whether more stream gaging stations are necessary to aid in flood forecasting and to provide dependable water flows to help fight forest fires. The provision would focus on the threat of flooding to roads and infrastructure and also provide data to determine the availability of water to aid natural resource extraction. ? Requires the U.S. Commissioner of Reclamation to study and map aquifers in urbanizing areas that are dependent on groundwater: The City of Fairbanks, the Fairbanks Northstar Borough, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Municipality of Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula. ? Requires the Bureau of Reclamation to study whether any new technologies in water purification/delivery, including new desalination systems, might be useful to coastal and island communities to improve potable water supplies. 
   ""The importance of water resource data collection to a State that has a resource-based economy cannot be overstated,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Economic development is predicated on access to an adequate water supply, and in my State there is inadequate hydrologic data upon which to secure both economic development and the health and welfare of Alaskan citizens."" 
   ""This bill will help communities plan for their future drinking water needs, which is a necessity as Alaska's population continues to grow,"" said Senator Stevens. ""Provisions in the legislation also allow the State to better design water systems and transportation infrastructure, while addressing the shortcomings of rural Alaska's water-sanitation systems. These improvements are critical to the development of our State's economy and will help ensure the health and safety of all Alaskans."" Murkowski, who noted that Alaska is estimated to hold one-third of all the fresh water in the nation, said the federal water study, already conducted for most of the rest of the nation, should be especially helpful to natural resource industries in the state in planning for the future. 
   She noted that resource developers, from oil production on Alaska's North Slope that needs water to build ice roads to potential mineral projects throughout the state, often have little baseline hydrology and water quality data available when they are required to meet environmental and regulatory permitting requirements. She said additional scientific information on water supplies will clearly benefit the state's residents, the economy, and the environment. 
   Under the bill the agencies will have two years to complete the required studies.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with the members of the congressional delegation she recently hosted in ANWR to discuss what the group saw on their trip to Alaska's coastal plain.  
   ""A week ago, I said I was looking forward to leading the delegation to show them how we in Alaska do exploration and production in a first class and first rate way - and that's what they saw,"" Sen. Murkowski said. ""[The members of the delegation] walked away very impressed with the technology that's been developed over the last thirty years."" 
   Murkowski said that the delegation was able to compare the size of the footprint created by the thirty-year old production facilities at Prudhoe Bay and the new facilities at the Alpine oil fields. The group examined the ice roads that connect drilling facilities during the long winter on the coastal plain and visited with the residents of Kaktovik - the only village in ANWR to hear local concerns over possible production. 
   At today's press conference with Sen. Pete Domenici (NM), Sen. John Thune (SD), Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, Murkowski also noted that contrary to the claims of Sen. Tom Harkin (IA), who did not go on the trip to Alaska, the delegation did, in fact, walk on the 1002 area of the coastal plain - the only area of ANWR proposed for oil and gas leasing. 
   Senators Domenici and Thune commented that a first hand account of production in Alaska gave each of them renewed confidence that the time to open ANWR is now and that production can proceed with minimal impact to the environment. ""...In spite of the fact that I had learned a lot about ANWR, I learned a lot more by actually being on the ground and having the issues explained on site. I'm led to the conclusion that if you look around the United States and other places oil might be developed...the most environmentally clean place to drill and produce oil is ANWR,"" Domenici said. ""In the end it will be the cleanest location for exploration and development that we will ever see."" 
   ""What we are talking about on the North Slope of Alaska, after seeing it first hand, is responsible development...reflective of the values and the cultures and the tradition of the people who live there,"" Sen. Thune said.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed final passage on Saturday of legislation that she co-sponsored with Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo., and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-MD, that will allow military personnel and their families to receive donated frequent flyer/travelers miles to cover military-connected travel.  
   The three on June 3 added the provision to the Defense Authorization bill for FY '05. On Saturday the conference report on the bill (H.R. 4200) passed both houses of Congress, sending the measure to the President for signature. The measure allows Americans to donate their miles to our men and women in uniform and their families. 
   ""The amendment will justly allow the families of wounded service personnel to visit their loved ones in a military hospital at no personal expense for airfare. It also will permit soldiers who must return home from overseas to do so at no cost by utilizing the air miles donated by Americans. This program allows Americans to show in a tangible way their support for our troops and it will help members of the military avoid the very real financial hardship caused when they need to purchase commercial airfares on short notice. It is the least we can do for our troops who are protecting us overseas,"" said Sen. Murkowski. 
   ""I applaud Sen. Murkowski for her leadership on this legislation. She worked hard on behalf of her constituents, and all of the men and women serving in our country, for this legislation. She recognizes the unique financial hardship that service members from Alaska could face when they return home from overseas while on emergency leave,"" said Sen. Talent. 
   The legislation makes Operation Hero Miles a permanent Department of Defense (DOD) program, giving DOD the authority to accept the donation of frequent traveler miles, credits and tickets by the general public in order to give free, last-minute plane tickets to servicemen and women on leave to handle an urgent family situation, convalescent leave or other unexpected emergencies. 
   The legislation also gives DOD the authority to give free plane tickets to family members of wounded troops traveling to visit their injured loved ones at military hospitals around the world. Under special circumstances, the DOD is also authorized to allow a non-family member, such as clergy or a close mentor, use of the donated miles to reunite with a wounded or ill service member. 
   The Department is to designate a single office to administer the Operation Hero Miles program, to establish rules and procedures for eligibility and disbursement of miles and to promote participation in the program and donation of miles by airlines, organizations and the public.

Sen. Murkowski this weekend gained the backing of Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, for her legislation to authorize the President to have the Mint design and strike a gold medal in honor of the Southeast civil rights leaders. Murkowski who was joined originally in proposing the medal by Alaska senior Sen. Ted Stevens, said the Mint by the law would also be authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the medal to honor their accomplishments on behalf of all Alaskans.  
   Murkowski said she hoped the bipartisan support will help speed passage of the legislation, possibly later this fall. Murkowski when she introduced the measure Sept. 22 noted the accomplishments of the Peratrovich family who after the invasion of Pearl Harbor in 1941 publicly called on Alaska's Territorial Governor to end the rampant discrimination against Natives that prevented Natives from equal treatment in hotel accommodations, housing, dining and other activities. In 1943 they formally proposed the territories' first anti-discrimination measure - it failed to pass. In 1945 they tried again, the measure passing the Territory's House. ""One by one (Territory) senators took to the floor to argue against the mixing of the races. One church leader testified it would take 30 to 100 years before Alaska Natives would reach the equality of the 'white' man. ""Then Elizabeth Peratrovich rose from the visitor's gallery and said she would like to be heard. In a quite, dignified and steady voice she said, 'I would not have expected that I, who am barely out of savagery, would have to remind gentlemen with five thousand years of recorded history behind them of our Bill of Rights.' ""When she finished, there was a wild burst of applause from the gallery and the Senate floor alike. The territorial Senate passed the bill by a vote of 11 to 5 and on Feb. 8, 1945 Alaska had an anti-discrimination law that provided that all citizens of the territory of Alaska are entitled to full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations - the bill passing 18 years before Dr. Martin Luther King spoke of his dream of civil rights for all on the steps of the Washington Monument and nearly 20 years before the U.S. Congress passed sweeping civil rights laws for the whole of American society,"" said Senator Murkowski. Murkowski said she is proposing the congressional gold medal to give long overdue recognition to the efforts of the Peratrovich family.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, arguing that firefighters as first responders are part of the backbone of our response to emergencies or terrorist attacks, this morning succeeded in winning an additional $50 million for firefighter assistance funding during debate on a Homeland Security appropriations bill continuing in the U.S. Senate. 
   Murkowski on Thursday had proposed an amendment to provide additional funding for grants for equipment, training and safety improvements for the nation's firefighters. The amendment was approved this morning on the Senate floor and added to the Homeland Security appropriations bill (H.R. 4567) for FY' 05 that the Senate should finish early next week.
   ""As we approach the third anniversary of the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks, we can't help but be reminded of the risks that our nation's firefighters take daily to keep us safe in time of emergency. We must do all that we can to make sure that we provide firefighters all the resources necessary to help them fight fires and to help them remain safe as they perform their dangerous, but vital work for this nation. These grants provide assistance to local fire fighters to protect the health and safety of the public and of firefighting personnel, including volunteers and emergency medical service workers,"" said Murkowski Thursday prior to adoption of her amendment to another provision in the $33.1 billion Homeland Security spending bill.
   The $50 million addition (Second Degree Amdt. 3616 to Amdt. 3578) brings to $750 million the amount of funding available for firefighter assistance grants for the coming year, a slight increase in funding over this year. Murkowski was joined in the amendment by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and by several other senators.
   In the 2003-2004 funding cycle, 44 Alaska fire departments earned $4,532,039 in fire grants to purchase fire apparatus, equipment and training. Another $710,000 was awarded to Alaska Village Initiatives to place fire apparatus custom designed to meet the needs of rural Alaska in the villages. Alaska departments have submitted 67 applications seeking $11.9 million in fire grants in the current funding cycle. Murkowski said the additional funds are critically needed for Alaska. The National Fire Protection Association of Quincy, Massachusetts reported in June 2004 that nearly two-thirds of fire engines in Alaska are over 15 years old, approximately 42 percent of firefighters on a shift lack portable radios and self-contained breathing apparatus, and nearly a quarter of Alaska firefighters lack personal protective clothing.
   ""It has truly been a long, hot summer for Alaska's firefighters who have been helping battle the wildfires, while still protecting all Alaskans from normal fire dangers. These additional funds should help Alaska firefighters continue to succeed in the nationwide competition for fire grants,"" said Murkowski.
   The full amendment includes an additional $50 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and added funding for the federal air marshal program, $50 million in additional funding for grants to protect high-risk terrorist targets, and $20 million for emergency management performance grants.

  In an effort to aid the Kenai Peninsula should the efforts to save the Agrium plant be unsuccessful, the Alaska Congressional Delegation has sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Labor urging that those affected by the closure be considered eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance.  
   Agrium U.S. Inc. is currently scheduled to shut down its Kenai Nitrogen Operations on Nov. 1, 2005. This is expected to cause the direct loss of 200 high paying skilled jobs and is likely to further impact more than 500 workers on the Kenai Peninsula. 
   ""Agrium is an important part of the Kenai Peninsula economy. The potential loss of jobs would be devastating to the already burdened community. Trade Adjustment assistance is needed to ensure that the people of the Kenai Peninsula are helped in every way possible,"" Senator Ted Stevens noted. 
   Through Trade Adjustment Assistance, the federal government aids communities where economies have been endangered through the impact of foreign trade. TAA can include health care, job training, and job relocation aid. In the past TAA has applied to industrial sectors such as the U.S. textile and shoe industries, which have suffered because of the increased competition from foreign products made possible by NAFTA and other trade agreements. 
   Alaska's Delegation was successful last year in having TAA apply to Alaska's fishermen as the fishing industry has been impacted severely through imports of foreign farmed fish. Similarly, the Delegation is now advocating TAA be applied to Agrium as the plant's closure is related to the shift of fertilizer plants overseas and the increased imports of nitrogen fertilizers as well as the high cost and low availability of domestic natural gas. 
   ""The potential closure of Agrium would further harm the Kenai Peninsula - where the unemployment rate is already four percent higher than the state's average. If Agrium is unable to stay open, we need to do all we can to help those that will be affected,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski said. 
   ""The closing of Agrium would be an extremely harsh blow to the overall economy of the Kenai Peninsula. The TAA would assist those affected and at best stabilize the economy,"" said Congressman Don Young. 
   During the past six years, 20 ammonia plants have closed in the United States, representing a drop of 20 percent in total U.S. production capacity. American production has fallen from 17.85 million tons in FY 1998-99 to 11.70 million tons in FY 2003-04. U.S. nitrogen imports have correspondingly risen to 10.36 million tons from 6.11 million tons during the same period. This trend has already claimed about 1,000 American jobs, according to The Fertilizer Institute.

MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR CENTRAL FIRE ASSISTANCE DECLARATION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed a decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to grant the state's and her request that the federal government issue a fire management assistance declaration specifically for the Central complex fire northeast of Fairbanks. The declaration, issued late Tuesday by FEMA, makes the state eligible for federal funding to pay for up to 75 percent of its costs involved in fighting the 260,000 acres of wildfires in the area. 
   ""It is good that the federal government understands the serious nature of all the wildfires continuing to burn in Alaska, and has expanded its previous assistance declaration for the Boundary fire and fires near Tok to take in the Bolgen Creek fire and the other fires burning in the Central area. This fire is threatening a number of subdivisions between Central and Circle Hot Springs and the state needs additional federal financial assistance to help bring the fires in the area under control,"" said Senator Murkowski this morning.
   The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program allows the federal government to pick up 75 percent of allowable costs. They include the:
   * Costs for equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds);
   * Costs for emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control);
   * Costs for state emergency operations centers;
   * Costs for the pre-positioning of federal, out-of-state resources for up to 21 days;
   * Costs for personal comfort and safety items for firefighters;
   * Costs for field camps and meals in lieu of per diem;
   * Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs;
   * Costs for the temporary repair of damage caused by firefighting;
   * And the costs of mitigation, management and control of fires on co-mingled federal lands.
   Senator Murkowski said FEMA granted the fire disaster assistance request since the Bolgen Creek fire, which involves 49 percent state land and 49 percent federal land with 2 percent in private hands, has flared up burning 64,700 acres since July 13, and now threatens Central and some 100 residential and 20 commercial properties.
   The Senator said she will continue to monitor state and federal agency needs to battle all of the fires now burning in the state.
   As of yesterday some 100 separate fires were still burning in Alaska having blackened 4.569 million acres so far this summer. The Central complex fire, which includes the Wolf Creek and Crazy fires northeast of Fairbanks, is the most serious at the moment, even though the 508,000-acre Boundary fire continues to burn in the headwaters of the Little Chena River and the 240,000-acre Taylor complex fire was also again active on Tuesday.

MURKOWSKI: LEGISLATION WILL CURB FRIVOLOUS CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed Senate passage of bipartisan legislation, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (S.5), to bring more fairness to the class action rules, and to help curb frivolous class action lawsuits.  
   ""I am pleased that the Senate took action today to help end frivolous lawsuits and the litigation tax that affects us all due to the manipulation of class action rules,"" said Murkowski. ""It is a good step toward solving some of the real problems we currently have with our legal system."" 
   ""This bill directly and effectively addresses the recent explosion of frivolous class action lawsuits in our country that have caused excessive attorney fee awards, unprecedented costs to our national economy and a declining respect for our judicial system,"" Murkowski noted after the Senate passed the class action reform bill 72 -26. ""It is court reform, not tort reform."" 
   The major provisions of the Class Action Fairness Bill are: 
   Federal District Court Jurisdiction for Interstate Class Actions - The legislation creates federal jurisdiction over class actions in which the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million and any member of a plaintiff class is a citizen of a different state from any defendant. The bill also treats certain mass actions with more than 100 plaintiffs as class actions for purposes of jurisdiction (as long as each plaintiff seeks $75,000 in relief). 
   Consumer Class Action Bill of Rights - This provision is designed to ensure that class members are the primary beneficiaries of the class actions process. The bill requires that judges carefully review all coupon settlements and limit attorney's fees paid in coupon settlements to the value actually received by class members; requires careful scrutiny of ""net loss"" settlements in which class members end up losing money; bans settlements that award some class members a larger recovery because they live closer to the court; and allows federal courts to maximize the benefit of class action settlement. 
   Notice to Public Officials - This provision requires a notice of proposed settlements be provided to appropriate state and federal officials such as attorney generals. 
   Local Class Action Exception - This provision keeps local controversies in state court and allows removal of class actions that are truly interstate in character to federal court. Under this provision, cases would stay in state court if the plaintiffs have sued at least one in-state defendant whose conduct forms a significant basis of their claims; if the principal injuries occurred in the state where the suit is brought; and if no class action has been filed alleging the same claims against any of the defendants in the last three years.

MURKOWSKI SECURES WIN FOR GASLINE INCENTIVES
  Saying getting Alaska's natural gas to market is vital for the nation's economic health, Sen. Lisa Murkowski today argued strongly for Senate passage of tax incentives to help speed construction of an Alaska gas pipeline project and praised passage of the provisions, following the bill's final passage in the Senate. 
   During debate after the Senate defeated a filibuster against the jobs bill, 90-8, and proceeded to the measure, Murkowski argued that the incentives are vital to increase natural gas production to meet the nation's growing energy shortfall. She noted that estimates are the country will be 10 to up to 20 billion cubic feet of gas short of meeting its needs by the next century.
   ""At a time when natural gas is trading at over $6.10 (per thousand cubic feet) and the spot price is double that, the incentives in this bill will help get Alaska natural gas to starved gas consumers in the Lower 48. It will help stabilize natural gas markets,"" said Murkowski in her prepared remarks, who added the incentives deserve to be in the jobs bill since an Alaska gas line also will generate hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide.
   Murkowski, who for weeks has been pushing for passage of financial incentives for an Alaska gas line, today argued successfully against an amendment that would have removed all $13 billion of energy tax provisions from the jobs bill including all of the Alaska gas line incentives. The amendment was to the jobs bill, also called the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) bill (S. 1637). The bill then passed the Senate on a 92-5 vote, heading to the House of Representatives for its consideration.
   The Alaska gas line tax provisions in the bill include:
   * A tax credit - an enhanced oil recovery credit - that will reduce the cost of building a needed North Slope gas conditioning plant.
   * A tax deduction, allowing for accelerated depreciation over seven instead of 15 years for sections of a pipeline project built in Alaska.
   * And a marginal well credit that will protect pipeline investors from steep drops in the price of natural gas if they occur in the future. The credit is capped at a maximum of 52 cents and will trigger only if the price of natural gas falls below $1.35 on the North Slope - an unlikely occurrence.
   ""Given the price of natural gas, some think we don't need to have the incentives that are included, but there is a necessity for passage of these incentives. We need these provisions for construction of this pipeline to go forward,"" said Murkowski.
   ""In essence, this is a futures contract with the American people. We provide the incentives to build the pipeline and you receive all the benefits that the gas pipeline has to offer,"" said Murkowski who noted that besides jobs the gas line will provide an abundance of clean-burning environmentally friendly fuel, provide critical feedstock at a reasonable price for the chemical and agricultural sectors and provide a secure domestic supply of energy.
   ""The Alaska natural gas pipeline is one of those really rare examples of a project that is a winner from every perspective. It helps us achieve our environmental goals, it helps the economy by creating a great number of good paying jobs and it enhances our national security. But if the energy tax provisions are stripped from the bill the relief that Alaska natural gas can provide remains stuck in the ground. We need to pass these provisions,"" said Murkowski on the Senate floor.
   Sen. Ted Stevens also praised passage of the Jobs bill. ""The JOBS bill provides Alaska with just that - jobs. The gas pipeline provisions in this bill are what the producers and industry need to move forward on the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline and the hundreds of thousands of jobs the project will create. Developing America's natural resources is key to creating American jobs,"" said Sen. Stevens.
   With passage of the jobs bill, which will now go to the House for its consideration, all of the tax provisions of pending national energy legislation have now again passed the Senate, clearing a major hurdle for final passage. The Senator said she will continue to press for final passage of the authorizing provisions of comprehensive energy legislation that will include the loan guarantee for the pipeline and a series of procedural and regulatory changes to speed pipeline construction. Those provisions also include leasing aid for oil development in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and a host of rural energy assistance.

MURKOWSKI ENCOURAGED BY NEW OIL, GAS ESTIMATES OF CENTRAL NORTH SLOPE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski said today she is extremely pleased by the new U.S. Geological Survey assessment of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources in the area between NPRA and ANWR.  
   The assessment concludes that there are 4.0 billion barrels of oil, 37.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 478 million barrels of natural gas liquids that are undiscovered and technically recoverable in the central North Slope. The assessment released today covers both state-owned and federal lands and does not include the existing 35 trillion cubic feet of known gas reserves of the Greater Prudhoe Bay field. It is the first formal assessment of the central North Slope conducted by the USGS. 
   ""The assessment of the foothills south of Prudhoe Bay simply reinforces how important it is for construction to proceed quickly on a natural gas pipeline project to move Alaska's huge reserves of natural gas to market,"" Senator Murkowski said. ""The new assessment is especially important since it reinforces the belief that there will be enough gas close to the pipeline to make a natural gas pipeline project economically viable, not for just 20 years but for 40 years or more. 
   ""The assessment also is important since it furthers the likelihood that we have enough gas, when you consider likely reserves in both the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and on the Arctic coastal plain of the North Slope, to fuel both a pipeline to the Midwest and a pipeline to tidewater, so Alaska can also sell its gas to West Coast markets. Admittedly a government estimate, in the absence of actual exploration, is not proof that the gas is there, but the fact that the government is now predicting that we have an even chance of finding more than 154 trillion cubic feet of gas on the North Slope (37.5 TCF from the Central North Slope, 73 TCF from NPRA, 9 TCF from ANWR, 35 TCF of known reserves in the Greater Prudhoe Bay field) should send a powerful message that this is the right time to begin construction of a pipeline to bring that gas to market."" 
   Senator Murkowski added that the estimate that the uplands contain 4 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil is also good news, since it should induce new exploration in the foothills that could further the life of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, especially if a small portion of the Arctic coastal plain is also opened to oil and gas development later this year. 
   ""A 4 billion barrel estimate combined with the 10.6 billion barrels of oil likely to be produced from ANWR, will be beneficial for a nation that likely will become nearly 70 percent dependent on foreign oil over the next two decades unless sizeable amounts of domestic oil are discovered and produced. We need every barrel and the prediction that the North Slope has an even chance of producing 25 billion barrels of new oil, plus an additional 7 billion barrels from the Greater Prudhoe Bay area, reaffirms that Alaska is a vital part of this nation's petroleum future,"" said Senator Murkowski. 
   The central North Slope lies between NPRA and ANWR, and extends from the Brooks Range northward to the State-Federal offshore boundary. The assessment was based on a review of all available geological, geophysical, and geochemical evidence.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) in introducing the ""Rural Physicians' Relief Act of 2006."" This legislation will both assist physicians who currently provide primary care in rural America and provide an incentive to encourage physicians to practice in these remote and underserved areas.  
   ""Physicians who provide health care in the most rural locations in American face challenges unlike their more urban counterparts,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""As a result, many of these areas tend to be the most medically underserved areas in the nation - areas where medical care is often urgently needed. It is my hope that our efforts will encourage physicians to practice in rural Alaska and throughout rural America."" 
   Patient access to health care in Alaska continues to be limited because of severe provider shortages. The state has 25% to 30% fewer physicians than is needed by the population, a total which ranks Alaska near the bottom in terms of physicians per capita in the country. The state needs to attract a minimum of 500 new doctors in order to meet the current national average of physicians per capita. An American Medical News article recently highlighted Alaska's problematic situation, noting that ""Alaska has long ranked among the worst states in terms of physician supply."" 
   The Rural Physicians Relief Act of 2006 will give a physician who is a primary health services provider a $1,000 tax credit for each month that he or she provides services in a designated ""frontier"" area. In addition, physicians who treat a high percentage of patients from frontier areas would also be eligible for the tax credit.

MURKOWSKI RESOLUTION HONORS FAMILIES OF FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS
  In honor of the families of fallen police officers, Sen. Murkowski offered Senate Resolution 473 which designates May 14th as National Police Survivors Day. The resolution is intended to engage all of our fellow citizens to lend their hearts and to lend a hand to the survivors of our police heroes.  
   ""It is a tragic fact that one law enforcement officer dies in the line of duty every 53 hours in the United States,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""As we remember the heroic deeds of our fallen law enforcement officers, let us also take a moment to reflect on those who are left to carry on. I am hopeful the nation will join me in doing this on May 14th - National Police Survivors Day."" 
   The date chosen has significance for many families. On May 14, 2003, on the eve of the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, 10 widows of fallen law enforcement officers came together. Out of this meeting came the birth of a new national organization called Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS). 
   One year later, COPS was formed at the first National Police Survivors Seminar which drew 110 law enforcement survivors. Today, COPS provides healing, love and the opportunity for a renewed life to over 15,000 families through a network of 48 chapters around the country.

MURKOWSKI APPLAUDS EFFORTS OF ANCHORAGE POLICE OFFICER TO HONOR FALLEN ALASKAN HERO AT NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMORIAL
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today recognized Anchorage Police Community Service Officer Cathy Diehl-Robbins for her successful efforts to honor a fellow officer who died from injuries sustained in the line of duty more than 50 years ago. Officer Diehl-Robbins is a 29 year veteran of the Anchorage Police Department who first took up the challenge of chronicling the department's history on her own time.  
   On June 9, 1953, Anchorage Police Officer William G. Pfalmer, Jr., was shot and paralyzed while stopping a stolen vehicle. Sadly, in 1970, he passed away as a result of his wounds he suffered 17 years earlier. This Sunday, May 13th, fallen Officer Pfalmer will be honored in the Nation's Capital as his name is added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. 
   At Senator Murkowski's request, Officer Diehl-Robbins has been invited by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund to read the name of Officer Pfalmer at a candlelight ceremony honoring the 383 fallen law enforcement officers whose names have recently been added to the memorial wall. The annual candlelight ceremony on Judiciary Square in Washington, D.C. draws upwards of 20,000 law enforcement officers and their families. One of Officer Pfalmer's three son's Garry Pfalmer and grandson Michael Pfalmer, both of Fairbanks, will also be on hand for the ceremony. 
   ""Because of the tireless efforts and perseverance of Officer Diehl-Robbins, an Alaskan hero will finally receive the honor he has earned,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Officer Pfalmer was a dedicated public servant who paid the ultimate sacrifice for upholding his oath to protect and serve. I thank Officer Diehl-Robbins for her commitment to her fellow officers and offer my gratitude to the family of Officer Pfalmer for his service to the city of Anchorage."" 
   For more than twenty years, Officer Diehl-Robbins has researched the history of the Anchorage Police Department. Roughly ten years ago, she came across an article about an officer who was shot and paralyzed. That officer was Officer Pfalmer. From that point forward, Officer Diehl-Robbins began actively researching the case and initiated a successful effort to have Officer Pfalmer be honored by the Anchorage Police Department, State of Alaska and at the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C. 
   This dedication takes place during National Police Week, which runs this year from May 13-19. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15th as National Peace Officers Memorial Day, and the calendar week in which May 15th falls as National Police Week. Today, there are 17,917 federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty and whose names are engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Officer Pfalmer will become the 43rd Alaskan to be honored on the Memorial.

MURKOWSKI WINS PASSAGE OF ?RED RIBBON' WEEK TO EDUCATE, ADVOCATE AGAINST DRUG, MARIJUANA USE
  Saying drug usage destroys lives, damages families and harms society, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski Sunday night won Senate approval of a resolution declaring the week of Oct. 23-31 as 'Red Ribbon Week' to call attention to the need for education and advocacy to prevent drug usage in society among all ages.  
   Murkowski welcomed Senate passage of the resolution she sponsored that will guide states, Parent Teacher Associations, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Governors and Attorneys General nationwide in partnering in an effort to call attention to the dangers of drug usage. This year's Red Ribbon Week, the 17th annual resolution commemorating anti-drug efforts, will kickoff in Alaska with anti-drug events starting on Oct. 22 in Anchorage. 
   ""Illicit drugs, the abuse of drugs, and the business of illegal drugs are not a private matter. Drugs harm children. Drugs harm our communities. Illegal drugs only facilitate dependency, addiction and the breakdown of the family. Alaska has the highest rates of domestic violence in the nation and one of the highest rates of sexual assault. According to the Anchorage Police Department alcohol and drugs were contributing factors in 80 percent of those crimes. 
   ""We must encourage our children to make better choices by making the same commitment in our own lives. We as parents and leaders must set good examples. We must stop sending confusing and mixed signals and clearly encourage our children not to make the wrong decision - not to experiment or use drugs,"" said Senator Murkowski following passage of the resolution. 
   Red Ribbon Week, first proposed in 1988 to honor former DEA Special Agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camerena who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by drug traffickers in 1985, annually involves millions of teens in drug prevention efforts, educational seminars and community events. The week encourages children and teens ""to choose to live a drug-free life,"" and encourage everyone ""to promote drug-free communities and to participate in drug prevention activities to show support for healthy, productive, drug-free lifestyles."" 
   Murkowski is slated to appear at the Anchorage kickoff event on Oct. 22, one being held in conjunction with the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Alaska National Guard, the Alaska State Troopers, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Alaska, many PTA groups and the Mayor of Anchorage, among others.

MURKOWSKI WINS SENATE APPROVAL OF STATEHOOD, NATIVE CORPORATION LAND CONVEYANCE ACCELERATION BILL
  Saying it has taken far too long for Alaska and Native corporations to gain full title to lands promised them at both Statehood and during the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Sen. Lisa Murkowski late Sunday pushed legislation through the Senate designed to complete the conveyance of pending land claims within the next five years.  
   ""It's been 45 years since Statehood, 33 years since passage of ANCSA and the repeal of the (Alaska Native) Allotment Act. Yet under current law and procedures we are at least 20 years from seeing these conveyances complete and some estimates are that it might take 85 years or longer for Alaskans to gain the land that is rightfully theirs. 
   ""Thus it is good news, indeed, that the Senate has taken the next step to streamline the conveyance process so we can get this done before the end of the decade,"" said Murkowski after the Senate approved the senator's Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act (S. 1466) on a unanimous vote. The bill now heads to the House for its consideration, hopefully later this fall. 
   Murkowski, joined by Sen. Ted Stevens, earlier in the 108th Congress had proposed legislation designed to speed up the conveyance of federal lands to the state and Alaska Native Corporations - an attempt to complete the transfer of all of Alaska's Statehood selections before the 50th anniversary of Statehood in 2009. The bill includes a number of other technical changes to solve a host of land conveyance problems in the state. 
   The bill is intended to lay out a blueprint for the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to complete the surveying and final title transfer of 89 million acres, 60 million of the state's outstanding 104-million-acre Statehood entitlement and the remaining 29 million acres of the 44 million acres given to Alaska Native Corporations under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The bill also includes measures that will assist in completing the transfer of some 2,500 Native allotment parcels claimed under terms of the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act. 
   The bill was modified extensively by Murkowski to address concerns raised by Alaskans during an Anchorage field hearing on the measure in August 2003 and a Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests Washington, D.C. formal hearing on Feb. 12, and suggestions made by Democratic staff and environmental groups. Some of the provisions in the bill and modifications made to it include: 
   * The bill will continue to help speed conveyances to the State, but its language was changed to limit the scope of discretion to the Secretary of the Interior by identifying specific lands to be conveyed in several provisions. * A provision in the original bill that allowed closed mining claims to be conveyed to the state was deleted at the request of environmental groups that argued it could have increased the size of the state's overall Statehood entitlement. * A provision in the original bill that allows the University of Alaska system to select the federal reversionary interest in its own properties remains, but an additional provision that would have allowed the university to select reversionary interests in properties owned by nonprofit groups was deleted. * It continues to attempt to solve the problem of outdated withdrawals that preclude mineral development on millions of acres of public lands. The bill now rather than immediately opening all lands to all public land laws, gives BLM 18 months to prepare recommendations to Congress on lands, which can be opened. The report will consider comments. * It clarifies the rights of miners' to convert from federal to state mining claims without jeopardizing ongoing mining operations. Properly maintained federal claims will continue to be excluded from conveyance. * The bill sets up a process where BLM will have broader authority to solve land claim disputes and give it the right to confer with land owners to get land transferred more quickly. It also sets up a timetable for the state and Native corporations to submit final conveyance priorities. * The bill gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to establish an Alaska field office at the Office of Hearings and Appeals and to staff it with Administrative law Judges and members of the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The goal is to speed up the slow pace of hearings in Alaska of all types of appeals * To address environmental concerns a provision that would have waived a 69,120-acre limitation on conveyance of lands within pre-ANCSA refuges was dropped, as was a provision to allow the conveyance of subsurface estates to regional corporations, and a provision involving Kaktovik lands. * A provision involving Native regional corporation selection rights was changed so that an additional 200,000 acres can be conveyed immediately. The goal to establish a final entitlement for regional corporations was not achieved because there was disagreement about what final acreage amounts were fair. * The bill has completely revised a title recovery section so that procedures similar to an existing court-approved settlement process for title recovery from the State of Alaska can be used for title recovery from ANCSA corporations. * To ease environmentalist concerns a provision was added that allows Native corporations and allotment applicants to adjust the boundaries of an allotment claim only if the relocation would not create a future problem for Conservation System Unit managers. * And the bill has removed proposed new deadlines affecting allotment applications, a key issue for many Native allotment holders. 
   Murkowski said the measure, while greatly simplified from its original version, still should accomplish its main goal of helping the federal government complete conveyances of most all of its outstanding land conveyances by the end of this decade. 
   ""Alaskans have waited for two generations to obtain the land we were promised at Statehood. Hopefully that long wait is now at an end,"" said Murkowski after she succeeded in getting the bill waived from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and then approved on the Senate floor. Additional funding to speed the pace of surveying and conveyance has already been proposed in the federal budget for next year to implement the terms of the bill.

MURKOWSKI: FISHERMEN GAIN INCOME AVERAGING PROVISION IN TAX BILL
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed final passage of a major tax change that will aid fishermen weather hard times in the fishing industry.  
   The Senate today followed the House and gave final passage to a new corporate tax bill that includes a provision to add fishermen to farmers as taxpayers who can average income over a three-year period to help offset high income years. The tax change, first proposed by the Alaska congressional delegation in 2000, will help fishermen recover from bad income years, by keeping a bit more of their income in good years, offsetting potentially high tax burdens in isolated windfall years. 
   ""Fishermen brave bad weather, unpredictable stream conditions and cutthroat global pricing conditions. They shouldn't be penalized further by the nation's tax code. Income averaging is fair in that it will help offset the highs and lows in fishing and help fishermen plan for their financial futures,"" said Murkowski, of the income averaging provision (Section 314) that was kept in the final bill, the House version of a Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) bill (now H.R. 4520). It now heads to the President for signature. 
   Income averaging was allowed for all prior to passage of the 1986 tax reform act because under an income tax with progressive tax rates, the total tax assessment on income that fluctuates from year to year will be greater than the tax levied on an equal amount of income that is received in equal annual installments. In 1986, when tax brackets were cut to two from 11, averaging was eliminated. But with the changes in the tax code that have gradually restored five brackets, it became clear that individuals in occupations that face wildly varying incomes, need to be able to income average to equalize their tax burdens. In 1997, Congress again allowed farmers to income average, making the change permanent for farmers in 1998. 
   The change, according to the Congressional Joint Tax Committee, is estimated to potentially save fishermen up to $61 million over the next decade, fishermen saving between $3 and $10 million yearly in taxes, depending on runs and fish prices. 
   Murkowski said passage of the change is a good principle that she will attempt to expand in the future to help fishermen once they receive money from their Exxon Valdez oil spill settlements. The tax law will still need to be changed so that financial settlements based from fishery damages will be considered as fishing income for purposes of being applicable to income averaging. 
   But restoring income averaging for fishing was a major first step in eventually making sure that fishermen don't pay large percentages of their settlements in federal taxes in the year in which the payments are finally made by Exxon.

MURKOWSKI SAYS ESKIMO WHALING CAPTAINS TAX CREDIT WILL HELP PROTECT HISTORIC WHALING, SUBSISTENCE IN ALASKA
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today praised final passage of a tax credit to help continue Eskimo whaling on the North Coast of Alaska, saying it is vital to protect the historic subsistence way of life in Arctic Alaska.  
   Murkowski, along with Rep. Don Young who helped finally secure the credit after a seven-year effort by the Delegation, said the credit is vital for north coast villagers. ""This was a hard provision to pass because congressmen had a hard time accepting or believing the traditions of Alaska where Eskimo villagers share equally from the harvest of whales, even though the village whaling captain by tradition pays the entire cost of the whale hunt. It took a lot of explaining for jaded members of Congress to understand the selflessness of the captains and the huge financial pressures that tradition are placing on captains to provide food for their fellow villagers,"" said Murkowski. 
   The credit allows Native Alaskan whaling captains to claim up to a $10,000 per year charitable tax deduction to offset their equipment and fuel costs for the annual subsistence whale hunts in generally the Beaufort Sea. 
   The credit, proposed in the 108th Congress by Murkowski (S. 293), had been added originally to a charitable tax bill that Democrats then filibustered to stop from passing. The provision was added to a House version of a major corporate tax bill by Congressman Don Young, allowing it to be considered in the conference that crafted the final tax measure that cleared the House on Friday and the Senate early this afternoon. It (H.R. 4520) now heads to the President for signature. 
   ""I'm pleased that my colleagues understood the need for this assistance to help Alaska North Slope residents continue their traditional subsistence whaling hunts. Subsistence whaling is vital to the survival of several North Slope communities, both culturally and economically,"" she said. 
   The tax change was first proposed in 1997 because of an IRS ruling that prevented North Slope whaling captains from deducting any portion of the costs of the traditional whale hunts from their taxes. The Senator noted that traditionally the captain of the hunt makes all provisions for the meals, wages and equipment associated with the hunt. In return the Captain is repaid in whale meat/ muktuk. 
   ""As part of the tradition, the captain donates a substantial portion of the whale to his village in order to help the community survive the harsh winter,"" Murkowski said. She noted that if the captain was engaged in a business he could deduct his costs from his taxes, or if he donated the whale meat to a formal charitable organization, he could deduct the costs from his taxes as a charitable donation. She said the tax law change is only fair, especially since whale meat has no commercial market because of the International Whaling Commercial ban on the sale of whale meat. 
   The change, likely to cost the government far less than $4 million over the next decade, will make a huge to the financial viability of the traditional Eskimo hunts. Murkowski and Young, however, noted that the tax break will not hurt bowhead whale populations, since the harvest is fully regulated and carefully limited by the Alaska Whaling Commission.

MURKOWSKI: GASLINE INCENTIVES PASS CONGRESS, HEAD FOR PRESIDENT; MARK MAJOR MILESTONE TOWARD LINE CONSTRUCTION
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed final passage of two key Alaska gas line tax incentives saying that they should help either a pipeline to the Lower 48 or an all-Alaska liquefied natural gas project to tidewater proceed to construction. The Delegation also succeeded in placing a loan guarantee to reduce investor concerns about the non-completion of the line and a series of important regulatory and administrative provisions to speed line construction - provisions originally won by Murkowski in the comprehensive energy bill - in the military construction appropriations bill that won Senate passage following the final vote on the tax measure. The loan guarantee will require the government to pick up 80 percent of the cost of the first $18 billion of the project should it not be completed.  
   ""These tax incentives represent a key piece that will allow companies to proceed with a project to get Alaska's huge reserves of natural gas to market. The puzzle isn't finished, but the federal outline is now done and we're closer than ever before to adding the finishing touches,"" said Murkowski after the Senate approved a major tax bill that included the gas line incentives, sending the measure to the President for signature. 
   ""Given all the obstacles we have had to overcome in this presidential election year, it is great news for Alaskans that the key federal tax incentives are now in place. These provide the economic incentives that will be needed to get Alaska's gas to market,"" said Murkowski. 
   ""With these incentives and the high prices for natural gas there is no reason Alaska won't be seeing the tens of thousands of jobs that a gas project will bring and the hundreds of millions of dollars of revenues from royalties from the state's one-eighth share of the gas and in severance and property taxes on the gas and pipeline facilities,"" said Murkowski. 
   She commented after first the House and then Senate approved a corporate tax bill (H.R. 4520) that includes the two key tax incentives needed to bring Alaska gas to market. The tax provisions include: allowing gas owners to amortize the cost of all Alaska-built segments of a pipeline from their taxes over seven instead of 15 years, a change that will save line owners an estimated $441 million over the life of the line, $150 million in the first 10 years, according to final estimates from the Senate Joint Tax Committee; and allowing an enhanced oil recovery tax credit for the cost of a needed gas conditioning plant on the North Slope of Alaska to process gas before it goes into a line. That provision should save the companies $295 million more in taxes in the first decade of the project. 
   Both provisions were structured to provide aid either to a trans-Alaska highway pipeline route to the Lower 48 or for an all-Alaska line that will move gas to tidewater in Southcentral Alaska where the gas would be liquefied for shipment to West Coast markets. 
   These provisions - along with an 80 percent, $18 billion loan guarantee to protect financiers against the risk that the line won't be finished, and expedited permitting and streamlined court review all contained in the military construction appropriations bill that also passed this afternoon - should be sufficient so that private firms can finance and build the up to $20 billion project, said Murkowski. 
   Murkowski, who had met with Chairman Thomas and spoken with other conferees in recent weeks, said the way is now cleared at the federal level for a decision on line construction to be made. 
   The military construction spending bill also includes vital regulatory and administrative changes. Besides the loan guarantee, the regulatory provisions added to the spending bill include: 
   * A ban on a northern route for the line - specifically preventing a pipeline from running across submerged lands in the Beaufort Sea. * A streamlined permitting and expedited court review process to speed construction and limit unnecessary judicial or regulatory delays. Specifically, the provisions create the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, which will be responsible for speeding construction of an Alaska gas line. The bill protects all of the right-of-way, and permitting certificates granted for an Alaska gas line under the 1976 Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act. The bill also requires any judicial complaints about a pipeline to be heard in an expedited process by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. * The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is established as the lead agency for a single environmental review that must be completed within 18 months of receiving a completed application, and issue a permit within 60 days after that. * Provisions that allow Alaska to control in-state use of the gas to facilitate use for heating or construction of a petrochemical industry in state. * Provisions to guarantee that current and future gas producers in Alaska will be able to compete to get their gas through the pipeline to market. * A provision that authorizes $20 million for a worker job training program in Alaska, including $3 million for construction of a Fairbanks training facility. The bill requires the Secretary of Labor to make grants to the state to fund training programs, including Alaska Natives, so they can work on the roughly $20 billion project. * Provisions promoting Alaska-hire provisions. * And provisions to encourage the manufacture of steel in the United States to be used in the pipeline and encouraging the companies to give Alaskans a chance to play a ownership role in the gas project.
  The loan guarantee is considered by many the most important financing provision since it assures investors they will not lose money should gas prices drop so dramatically as to prevent completion of any line once construction starts. The guarantee should reduce the interest rate needed to attract financing for the line, thus reducing its cost, while also protecting investors who will be financing the largest private construction project in the nation's history. 
   Murkowski noted that the Energy Information Administration estimates that natural gas demand in America will rise by more than 50 percent by 2025, leaving the nation utterly dependent on imported liquefied natural gas, unless the Alaska project is built - Alaska able to supply the nation with 4.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day from the state's reserves of at least 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas located at Prudhoe Bay. The gas project will fuel thousands of direct and indirect jobs in Alaska and supply the state with between $450 million and nearly $1 billion a year in revenues in the future. 
   The tax bill also includes other provisions for Alaska such as a tax deduction to encourage continued Native subsistence whaling and a provision to allow fishermen to average their fishing incomes over three years for tax purposes (See related releases).

MURKOWSKI DISCUSSES WAYS TO COMBAT METH USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE DURING TRAVEL TO NORTHWEST ARCTIC REGION
  Concerned about the rampant increase of methamphetamine usage among Alaska's youth, Sen. Lisa Murkowski has been highlighting the issue and speaking about ways to combat this emerging problem during her travel to the Northwest Arctic Borough. During community visits to Deering, Buckland, Noorvik and Selawik, Sen. Murkowski had the opportunity to discuss this serious issue directly with high school students and community leaders.  
   ""The startling increase in meth use among Alaska's youth is of grave concern not only to those of us who are parents of teenagers, but also to those who are committed to ensuring a prosperous future for our children,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""In communities large and small throughout our state, we are learning that more and more children are experimenting with meth - and unfortunately this trend shows no sign of slowing down. Leaders throughout Alaska must work together to take decisive steps to effectively combat this alarming trend. We owe no less to our children."" 
   At the national level, efforts are underway to make critical federal funding available to states. The Combat Meth Act, which Senator Murkowski co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate, is modeled after the successful Oklahoma law that resulted in an immediate 80% drop in meth labs seized and restricts the sale of the ingredients needed to make methamphetamine. The goal of the law is to impose tougher penalties for meth production and trafficking, while allowing legitimate consumers access to the medicines they need without a prescription. The law also provides law enforcement with an additional $99 million per year for the next five years to train state and local law enforcement to fight meth offenders. Those funds can also be used for equipment, prosecution or environmental clean-up of meth lab sites. Of equal importance, the law provides $20 million in grant funding in 2006 and 2007 to promote collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies to assist and educate children that have been harmed by the production of methamphetamine.

MURKOWSKI ANNOUCES FEDERAL GRANT FOR FAIRBANKS FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined Fairbanks Fire Department Chief Warren Cummings in announcing a $675,000 federal grant to help cover the cost of a new aerial ladder. The National Fire Protection Association recommends that departments replace apparatus built prior to 1979 in order to help address fire fighter capabilities and safety. The Fairbanks Fire Department is currently using an aerial ladder that was built in 1977.  
   The grant announced today was awarded through the 2005 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Fairbanks Fire Department was one of 19 departments in Alaska to receive funds through the program. Since 2003, Fairbanks has received $1.2 million in federal fire grants. 
   ""Fire grants are awarded solely on the basis of merit in a nationwide competition, so when a department wins a fire grant, it is indeed something to be proud of,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""It is vitally important that our fire fighters have equipment available to them to help meet their ""all hazards"" mission safely and effectively. I applaud Chief Cummings for his successful effort to secure this funding for your new ladder and thank all of Fairbanks fire fighters for the extraordinary job they do each and every day."" 
   ""The new aerial platform will not only benefit the City of Fairbanks, but all of the Interior Emergency Service Organizations under our area wide mutual aid agreement,"" said Chief Cummings. ""Currently the City of Fairbanks is the only fire department with this type of emergency equipment in the interior. The grant funding received will help ensure we have a safe and reliable aerial platform on continuous bases."" 
   It is anticipated that the order for the new ladder will be placed next week through Quality Equipment Sales and Services of Anchorage and that it will be delivered in the Spring of 2007.

MURKOWSKI ADDRESSES TROOP EXTENSION
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today made the following remarks concerning Secretary Gates' announcement that all Army personnel serving in Iraq will have their tours extended to 15 months.  
   Once again, our Nation's senior defense leaders have called upon the families of our active duty soldiers to muster all of their strength and courage and accept an extension of the period their loved ones will serve in overseas deployment. My heart goes out to the parents, spouses, children, and friends of all of those who are affected by the announcement. Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to our military families whose sacrifices at home are no less integral to the defense of our freedoms than the work of their loved ones on the battlefield. 
   My resolve to ensure that our senior military leaders will do all that they can to help our military families through the difficult days that may follow has not weakened since the return of the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team last December after a 16 month deployment. The military maintains that they learned a great many lessons from the support that they provided to our Fort Wainwright families during that extended deployment. Their challenge is to provide that same level of support on Army posts nationwide. Our military families deserve no less. I am disappointed that our military families at Fort Richardson had to learn about Secretary Gates' announcement through the news media. The senior leaders in the Department of Defense heard loud and clear from our Fort Wainwright families that extensions are traumatic events and should be announced with the greatest of sensitivity. The decision should have been delivered to families through the chain of command before it was delivered to the Nation in a news conference. The Fort Richardson paratroopers were deployed in October 2006 and were expected to return about the same time this year. While no extension is welcome, at least our servicemen and their families have reasonable notice by informing them of this extension six months before the anticipated return date. I do not know what the effect of the decision will have on the families of other units that may have expected an earlier return. In addition, Secretary Gates' statement provided certainty that the extension period would not exceed 3 months. Throughout the fall of 2006, our Fort Wainwright families were forced to cope with the uncertainty about whether their loved ones would suffer an extension over and above the 4 months initially announced. Secretary Gates' prediction that the 15 month duty period would enable units at least 12 months at home between deployments provides further certainty to our soldiers and their families. Secretary Gates indicated that the new policy applies only to active military and not to components of the National Guard. I will be contacting the Department of Defense to clarify that no extension of the deployment of our Alaska National Guard members is in the offing. As always, my office is available to assist our military families in every way possible. My constituent service offices in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Wasilla have been working with families since this war began and will continue to do so. Military families that wish to contact me directly should do so by visiting my website - www.murkowski.senate.gov.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, saying that all Alaskans deserve decent housing, today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing the state with a series of grants to maintain, modernize and in some cases expand public, low-cost housing in Alaska. 
   Murkowski, who last year under the umbrella of the Alaska Project convened the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development, Education and Health and Human Services to discuss ways to improve housing in the state, also won a commitment from the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Agency to expand funding with a goal of starting 500 new public housing units in Alaska annually starting in 2005.
   Murkowski today announced that under the Department's Indian Housing block grant program five grants are being released today for public housing improvement and operation. They are:
   * The Tlingit and Haida Central Housing Authority based in Juneau is receiving a grant for $7,946,383 for operations and housing stock modernization in Southeast.
   * Ourtsaramiut Inc. of Bethel is receiving $1,842,906 for its public housing efforts.
   * The Village of Lime Village is gaining a grant for $25,331.
   * The Village of Tanacross is gaining $162,180.
   * And the Village of Ouzinkie is gaining $107,948
   Murkowski said these grants are in addition to a series of additional public housing grants from HUD announced last week, whose money is now being released.
   * The Rural Alaska Community Program based in Anchorage has gained a grant from the Rural Housing and Economic Development Program for $150,000 to promote economic development in its communities.
   * The Municipality of Anchorage is gaining a grant for $165,488, while the State of Alaska is gaining eight separate grants totaling $ 12.572 million to fund the HOME program, the American Dream Downpayment initiative. This is the law, co-sponsored by Senator Murkowski in 2003, that provides resources to help lower-income people make down payments and closing costs for the purchase of homes.
   * Village of Eyak based in Cordova has gained a grant from the Office of Native American Programs for $103,403 for its housing program to modernize or operate low-income housing in the area.
   * The Chilkoot Indian Association based in Haines has gained a grant from the same program for $257,249 for low-income housing programs.
   * The Northwest Inupiat Housing Authority based in Kotzebue had gained a grant from the same program for $4.23 million public housing project in the area.
   * Tagiugmiullu Nunamiullu Housing Authority based in Barrow has gained a grant from the same program for $5.02 million for public housing programs. 
   * The Village Aniak has gained a grant from the same program for $285,052 for public housing for the coming year.
   * And the Iqurmiut Traditional Council based in Russian Mission has gained a grant for $145,064 from the same program for public housing for the coming year.

MURKOWSKI ASKS CANADA TO HALT BLACK COD FARMING EFFORTS UNTIL ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED, FINISHED
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski Wednesday urged Canada to prevent the start of sablefish (black cod) fish farming off British Columbia's coast until environmental studies are not only started, but completed. 
   Murkowski, in a letter to the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Michael Kergin, asked that the Canadian Government stop a proposed transfer of 30,000 juvenile black cod to Canadian off-shore fish farms this summer and delay any future sales of juvenile black cod to British Columbia fish farms pending more scientific studies.
   ""North America's sablefish industry is one of the best managed fisheries on the continent. Stocks are healthy due in part to rigorous assessments paid for by the industry. I strongly believe that until the potential dangers from farming this species are better understood, wild fish stocks in both Canada and the United States may suffer irreparable damage (should you proceed),"" wrote Murkowski in her letter to Kergin.
   Murkowski's comments come after an Ottawa judge recently ruled that Sablefin Hatcheries may go forward with its planned sale of juvenile black cod to British Columbia fish farms, allowing the farms which up until now only raised Atlantic Salmon to diversify into black cod stocks. Murkowski, who months ago first expressed environmental concerns about the potential new fish farming operations, said the recent escape of another 2,500 Atlantic salmon from a British Columbia fish farm in Broughton Archipelago once again reinforces Alaskan concerns that the release of farm-raised fish could hurt Alaska's wild fish stocks.
   The effort to farm black cod ""comes in spite of the fact that Canada has not completed an environmental assessment of raising sablefish in ocean net pens. It is my understanding that the criteria to do an environmental assessment for sablefish have not even been developed yet. With reports of a link between open-water fish farm pens and increases in the amount of sea-lice and other parasites present in British Columbia's waters, there is considerable concern about the health risks posed to wild sablefish in both Canada and Alaska, not to mention the potential transfer of parasites between salmon and sablefish,"" said Murkowski.
   Besides the issue of the potential increase in sea-lice and other parasites from fish farming, the Senator previously had questioned the potential for genetic damage to wild stocks from the accidental release of pen-reared stocks - especially as it relates to salmon farming in British Columbia and its affects on Alaska's salmon stocks.
   Murkowski urged Canada to halt the start of black cod farming, at least, until scientific studies are completed.
   Alaska fishermen in 2002 landed 3.25 million pounds of sablefish, which at an average price of $3.35 a pound, had an ex-vessel value of $10.89 million. The vast bulk of the state's catch was harvested in Southeast waters, which stand to be most impacted on environmental grounds by British Columbia fish farming efforts.

MURKOWSKI, SEN. STEVENS INTRODUCE TAX LEGISLATION TO ASSIST EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL PLAINTIFFS
  Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens today introduced tax legislation to give the plaintiffs in the Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement the ability to increase retirement contributions and to provide tax relief through income averaging.  
   The bill would provide tax relief to all of the individual plaintiffs in the oil spill settlement, 80% of whom are commercial fisherman. It was drafted to cover any possible settlement while the case is in litigation and any amounts received under the judgment if it is upheld. The current level of court-approved punitive damages is $2.5 billion, plus interest. 
   ""This bill provides financial relief to those impacted by the spill when it comes to contributions to retirement plans and averaging of income for tax purposes,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""It is imperative that we address this important issue to help our fishermen plan for their retirement needs."" 
   ""The Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred nearly 18 years ago, but many Alaskans are still dealing with losses incurred by the disaster,"" said Senator Stevens. ""Commercial fisherman and others whose livelihoods were adversely impacted by the spill have not been able to plan adequately for retirement. I am pleased to work with Senator Murkowski in introducing legislation to address this important issue."" 
   The bill includes the following provisions: 
   Contributions to Retirement Plans * Increases the caps on deductions and income for traditional IRAs to the extent of the income the individual receives from the settlement or judgment. * Allows contributions to Roth IRAs to the extent of the income from the settlement or judgment. * Allows contributions to any other type of qualified retirement plan [e.g., SEPs, 401(k)/Profit Sharing Plans, etc] to the extent of the income received from the settlement or judgment. 
   The bill gives the plaintiffs until the end of the taxable year in which they receive the settlement to transfer funds to one of the aforementioned retirement plans. In practice, plaintiffs would be able to use settlement funds to contribute to retirement plans until the day before the tax filing deadline for the taxable year when they received the funds. 
   Income Averaging This bill draft allows a plaintiff to average his or her income between December 31 of the year he or she receives the settlement or judgment payment and January 1, 1994 - the year of the original court decision in Anchorage. 
   Lump Sum Payments vs. Periodic Payments There is a possibility that the plaintiffs will receive settlement/judgment funds as periodic payments, instead of a lump sum payment. If the former is the case, this bill is drafted so that the plaintiffs can still take advantage of the provisions in the bill.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today introduced S.290 - the ""Rural Physicians' Relief Act of 2007."" Originally introduced in the 109th Congress, this legislation will both assist physicians who currently provide primary care in rural America and provide an incentive to encourage physicians to practice in these remote and underserved areas.  
   ""My hope is to encourage physicians to practice medicine in rural Alaska and throughout rural America,"" said Senator Murkowski ""Creating incentives that offset the high cost of providing care in the most remote areas of the nation will go far in recruiting physicians to the areas that are most in need of their services. This legislation will bring some much needed assistance to physicians who provide primary health services to rural America."" 
   Patient access to health care in Alaska continues to be limited because of severe provider shortages. The state has 25% to 30% fewer physicians than is needed by the population, a total which ranks Alaska near the bottom in terms of physicians per capita in the country. The state needs to attract a minimum of 500 new doctors in order to meet the current national average of physicians per capita. An American Medical News article recently highlighted Alaska's problematic situation, noting that ""Alaska has long ranked among the worst states in terms of physician supply."" 
   The Rural Physicians Relief Act of 2007 will give a physician who is a primary health services provider a $1,000 tax credit for each month that he or she provides services in a designated ""frontier"" area. In addition, physicians who treat a high percentage of patients from frontier areas would also be eligible for the tax credit. The National Rural Health Association endorses this legislation and the Alaska Medical Association strongly supports the bill.

   The Indian Health Care Improvement Act was last authorized in 1992 and expired in 2001. In June 1999 a National Steering Committee, including many prominent Alaskan Native leaders, was born with the mission of bringing Indian Country together to speak with one voice about the reauthorization of the Act. Senator Murkowski praised the committee for their persistence in keeping the issue before Congress these many years. 
   Senator Murkowski is a co-sponsor of S.1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act reauthorization bill in the current Congress. The bill passed out of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on May 10 and was considered and passed by the Senate Finance Committee today. The bill now will head to the Senate floor. 
   ""The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is crucial to the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""The bill is the product of thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of hours of work by our tribal leaders. It is a bill that all of Indian Country can be proud of and indeed one that enjoys broad support from all corners of Indian Country. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take action that is long overdue."" 
   According to Indian Health Service statistics, American Indians and Alaska Natives die at higher rates than other Americans from tuberculosis, alcoholism, motor vehicle crashes, diabetes, unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide.

For Alaska in particular, the bill contains authorization for harbor projects at Akutan Harbor, Haines, Kodiak and Sitka. 
   ""Today, we won some long-sought authorizations for major projects that should help the state's fishing industry be more efficient, more profitable and improve the state's overall marine transportation infrastructure,"" said Murkowski. 
   The act authorizes the federal component of $9.8 million for the $12 million harbor project at Akutan in the Aleutians. For the improvement of the small boat harbor in Haines, the act authorizes the Corps to carry out the project, which has an estimated federal cost of $9.7 million. The act authorizes the removal of rubble and rock impeding the entrance to the St. Herman and St. Paul Harbors at Kodiak, with an expected federal cost of $2 million. Also, the act authorizes the Corps to improve the breakwater of Thompson Harbor in Sitka. The federal government will pick up the entire $6.3 million cost of the project. 
   Also today, the Committee approved Steven Johnson to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Johnson currently serves as the Acting Administrator of EPA. Most recently he has been Deputy EPA Administrator and Assistant EPA Administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Prior to his EPA service, Johnson served as Director of Operations at Hazleton Laboratories Corporation and Litton Bionetics, Inc. 
   ""Steve's many years of experience will be a continued asset to the EPA. I look forward to working with him on issues of importance to Alaska and the country,"" Murkowski said.

""Our investment today in prevention, treatment and research will help ensure that fewer and fewer children will become afflicted with FASD and will save in future health costs of this devastating disorder."" 
   The resolution encourages the American people to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; to increase compassion for individuals affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol; and to ensure healthier communities throughout the United States. On National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness day, Americans are also encouraged to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of September 9, 2006, to remember that during the nine months of pregnancy a woman should not consume any alcohol.

MURKOWSKI SUPPORTS CLEAN PORTFOLIO STANDARD IN SENATE ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined Sens. Pete Domenici (R-NM), Larry Craig (R-Idaho), Robert Bennett (R-Utah), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) in introducing a Clean Portfolio Standard (CPS) amendment to establish a federal 20 percent Clean Portfolio Standard (CPS).  
   The CPS amendment is an alternative to a proposal by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M) to establish a more narrow 15 percent federal Renewable Portfolio/Electricity Standard (RPS). The CPS alternative includes renewable technologies like wind and solar energy, but also allows clean energy resources like nuclear, new hydropower, fuel cells, and others to count toward the 20 percent standard. 
   ""One key difference between the two proposals is in how they account for hydropower,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Under the Renewable Portfolio Standard new hydropower does not count toward meeting the production mandate. Only incremental power - the addition of turbines to existing facilities - can count. Under the Clean Portfolio Standard new hydro power - not power from dams spanning rivers, but all other forms of new hydro power such as power from small hydro projects and from lake taps - can count. That is an important distinction."" 
   ""This amendment represents a fair and flexible way to promote clean fuel technology,"" said Senator Stevens. ""This approach is particularly important to Alaska because our state relies so heavily on hydropower and geothermal energy. As Congress continues to find methods to increase our nation's use of renewable energy, we must remember to take into account the challenges our rural communities face and ensure our actions do not increase costs for consumers."" 
   In Alaska, about 40% of the power in urban Alaska comes from hydroelectric lake tap projects that have zero environmental impacts since they do not affect stream flows or fish runs. These projects would not count in the RPS being considered by the Senate. 
   The CPS allows utilities to use solar, wind, geothermal, ocean, biomass, landfill gas, hydropower, nuclear, fuel cells, inherently low emissions technology, and energy efficiency measures to meet the 20 percent mandate. In addition, other clean energy sources certified by the Department of Energy would be eligible. 
   If a state is still not able to comply with the CPS mandate, the funds collected in penalties would be transferred directly back to the state to be used to promote clean energy production. 
   The CPS would allow states that already have RPS standards to continue using them by allowing the Governor of each state to certify that there is an existing RPS. This would allow states to continue to tailor their low emissions mandates to meet the resources available in their states.

MURKOWSKI HORRIFIED BY IRAQI DETAINEE ABUSE PHOTOS; SAYS INVESTIGATION MUST SETTLE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUE
  After viewing the latest photos and video of Iraq prisoner abuse, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was horrified at the abuse apparently inflicted at the hands of American forces. Sen. Murkowski also said the investigation into the incidents must get to the bottom of who was responsible. 
   ""I was horrified. It was disturbing to view the number of photographs and the degradation and humiliation of the Iraqi prisoners. I quite honestly was sickened by what I saw,"" said Murkowski.
   ""There is a difference between reading about a situation and seeing an individual in a terribly compromising position and seeing the horror in someone's eyes. And seeing that in these pictures is horrific.
   ""Obviously the investigation is ongoing and has been on going for some months. We are in the process of determining the extent of this and it is imperative we understand who was involved, the extent of the involvement and whether this was an isolated series of incidents or whether it was indicative of a more systemic failure, and we need to understand - Americans need to understand - the extent of this,"" said Murkowski.
   She said she was disturbed by the fact that in some of the photos it appeared that others were directing the abuse. ""Knowing it is not only the individuals involved in making the prisoners do these acts, but that you had someone standing by and photographing and that there were others in the pictures, other American men and women in uniform who were standing by, is extremely troubling. It was not just one person who lost it and went off the deep end, but implicit in this is that there was support, because the actions weren't stopped,"" said Murkowski, who said that the investigations must press to know the full causes for the behavior, so that it can be prevented from ever reoccurring.
   The Senator, during a press availability this afternoon, talked on other topics.
   Gasline Financial Incentives: The Senator said now that the Senate has approved a series of financial incentives to aid construction of an Alaska gas line, she will continue to press for the House to include the aid in its Jobs bill, or at least for the aid to be included in a final post-conference jobs measure.
   Murkowski on Tuesday won Senate support for three financial incentives for a gas line: accelerated tax depreciation on the pipeline segments in Alaska, a tax deduction to reduce the cost of building a gas conditioning plant on Alaska's North Slope and a marginal well tax credit to reduce gas owners tax burdens if the price of natural gas falls to extremely low levels. Those provisions now await House action.
   Murkowski said she is an optimist by nature and is hopeful that the House will accept all the provisions, including the more controversial marginal well tax credit. ""I'm an optimist by nature. The glass is always half full in my view. It is the Senate that has been having trouble getting legislation moving this year. It was really a huge hurdle to win Senate passage of the incentives. We won a huge win and now we'll keep fighting for all the incentives in the House, or in a conference committee.
   ""These incentives are important because the gas line is so important for Alaska's future. The gas line is a prize that is truly worth fighting for,"" said Murkowski.
   Police Memorial Ceremony: And Senator Murkowski today met with the widow of Kenai Police Officer John P. Watson, in advance of a candlelight ceremony at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, where the Senator will add his name.The senator met with Officer Watson's widow, Kathy, and with Kenai Police Department Sergeant Scott McBride, who is in Washington for the annual National Police Week ceremonies at the memorial.
   Murkowski announced that the Justice Department today awarded seven Alaska law enforcement agencies some $19,000 in grants to pay for bullet-proof protective vests for police officers. The State of Alaska gained $6,849 for vests for Alaska State Troopers, Fairbanks Police gained $6,864 for additional protective vests, the Haines Borough gained $1,725 for vests, the City of Craig in Southeast gained $1,685, both Nome and Whittier Police Departments gained grants of $809, while Kenai gained $282 for protective vests, Murkowski said.
   ""While we'll never know if a protective vest would have helped Officer Watson, clearly these grants can help protect the officers who protect us every day. It is money that is well spent indeed,"" said Sen. Murkowski, who said she is honored by being able to participate in the annual law enforcement ceremony at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Watson was killed on Christmas night 2003 in Kenai.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with doctors of osteopathic medicine, medical students, and Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA), Tom Coburn (R-OK), and Richard Burr (R-NC) to call on Congress to debate and pass meaningful medical liability reform.  
   Noting that the high cost of medical insurance and the threat of large liability lawsuits has driven many Alaskan physicians away from the state or into early retirement, Murkowski said that the lack of medical liability reform is a real problem that needs to be addressed. 
   ""Now, I come from the incredibly great state of Alaska. And I'll stand and brag and boast about my state, but we've got a real problem right now,"" Murkowski told the assembled crowd of physicians and students. ""We've got a real problem in that we have lost one half of our internists in the past five to seven years. One half of our internists are no longer practicing in the state of Alaska. I've got a state that is more than 570 thousand square miles. It is huge. Alaskans need to be seen by practicing physicians"" 
   Murkowski noted that in Alaska, where medical liability reform has not yet been enacted, there are only three practicing neurosurgeons in the entire state. Whereas, in Idaho, a state with roughly twice the population of Alaska and where liability reform has been enacted, there are 17 neurosurgeons. 
   Today's event was held in conjunction with the American Osteopathic Association's annual advocacy day.

MURKOWSKI WINS PASSAGE OF EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL TAX LEGISLATION
  Senator Murkowski today won Senate approval of tax legislation to give individual plaintiffs in the Exxon Valdez oil spill litigation ability to increase retirement contributions and to provide tax relief through income averaging. The legislation was included as an amendment to the Senate Farm Bill, which passed this afternoon. 
   The legislation provides tax relief to all of the individual plaintiffs in the oil spill settlement, 80 percent of whom are commercial fishermen. It was drafted to cover any possible settlement while the case is in litigation and any amounts received under the judgment if it is upheld. The current level of court-approved punitive damages is $2.5 billion, plus interest.
   ""Today is a great day for the approximately 30,000 plaintiffs in the Exxon Valdez oil spill case,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""This legislation will provide tax relief so that the fishermen and Alaskans who will receive punitive damages will be able to keep more of the money they rightfully deserve. It was critical to get this legislation passed now in anticipation of the Supreme Court's final decision in the spring, and I am thankful for my colleagues support in the Senate.""
   The bill includes the following provisions:
   * Allows individual plaintiffs to income average any payouts from this case over a three year period of time. Currently, fishermen can average their income over three years due to the volatile nature of the industry. Despite the fact that any income from this case is essentially lost income for fishermen and others whose livelihoods were negatively impacted by the spill, punitive damage or settlement-related income from litigation can not be averaged over three years under current law.
   * Permits individual plaintiffs to contribute up to $100,000 to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) IRA and other retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans and 457 plans.
   * Exempts plaintiffs from having to pay self-employment taxes or payroll taxes on any payouts from this case.

MURKOWSKI PRAISES PASSAGE OF SENATE ENERGY BILL
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today welcomed final Senate passage of major energy legislation.
   ""This is a great step in reducing energy costs for Alaskans and the nation,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""While the bill is not the total solution to our country's energy needs, it does make major advances in aid for renewable energy and promotes greater energy efficiency in vehicles, buildings and appliances. The bill does not contain the provisions many of us wanted to include to increase supplies of domestic energy. I am hopeful that now that Congress has agreed to significant conservation through an increase in CAFE and has agreed to provide for investments in renewable energy that we will address the third critical aspect of energy policy by increasing domestic production,"" said Murkowski, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   The bill, the final Senate substitute for a House-passed energy bill (H.R. 6), will require a 40 percent increase in vehicle fuel economy standards (to an average of 35 mpg compared to the current 25) by 2020 covering not only cars, but sport utility vehicles and light trucks. But the measure crafted by Senator Ted Stevens, to protect the desires of Alaskans for vehicles capable of hauling and holding heavier loads, includes greater flexibility by keeping dual standards between cars and light trucks. The new standards should save more than 1.5 million barrels of oil a day by 2025.
   The vehicle provisions also include one proposed by Murkowski earlier this year in her energy efficiency REFRESH Act. The provision will require a study of the fuel savings that could result from enacting of a Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standard on heavy commercial trucks, those weighing over 10,000 pounds. Estimates are that the nation could save about 450,000 barrels of oil each day and save the trucking industry enough money on fuel to pay for the upgrades in only a few years if trucks and tractor-trailers achieved a 30 percent increase in fuel efficiency over current levels. If studies confirm the estimates Congress still will have to approve future legislation to extend CAFE requirements to commercial trucks.
   The energy bill includes a host of provisions to further renewable energy development including a Renewable Energy Deployment Grant program that Murkowski authored with Senator Stevens. That measure will provide federal grants of up to 50 percent of the cost of building a wide variety of renewable electricity projects: wind, geothermal, ocean (wave, tidal and current), biomass, solar, landfill gas and small hydroelectric projects in Alaska. The grant program, when funded, should help with the installation of potential projects like the Fire Island wind farm, and ocean energy projects in Cook Inlet or Southeast.
   Additionally, the legislation includes:
   * A federal grant program specifically to help with construction of geothermal energy projects in areas of high electricity costs like Alaska. The provision, part of a major initiative to fund research and deployment of geothermal energy nationwide, could help with installation of geothermal projects from Mt. Spurr to Naknek and Unalaska to Chena Hot Springs.
   * An amendment co-authored by Murkowski with Hawaii Sen. Daniel Akaka that provides major federal aid to ocean energy development; including the establishment of at least one and perhaps six national ocean research centers to fund research on development of technology that will generate power from wave and tidal energy.
   * Several sections to aid in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It specifically requires a study by the U.S. Geological Survey to find geologic structures to store carbon underground, keeping it out of the environment. The bill also includes funding for research on building large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities and calls for construction of demonstration storage facilities to prove that carbon can be stored at reasonable cost in the future. These provisions may help the Agrium coal gasification project at Kenai.
   * Promotes renewable fuels by raising the renewable fuels standard to require the production of 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022, compared to the current production of about 7 billion gallons a year. That would be enough to equal about 20 percent of the nation's transportation fuel needs in 15 years. The standard, however, to cut excessive increases in corn costs, only allows 15 billion gallons of the fuel to come from corn-kernel-based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol and other forms of biofuels and biodiesel, including fuels made from fish oils, will be expected to fill the rest of the requirement. The bill includes a host of provisions: research, aid for biorefinery construction and aid in development of ethanol pipelines and transportation delivery and distribution systems to help meet the standards.
   * Promotes new lighting standards, and tightens energy standards for a host of appliances and furnaces, and sets new goals for U.S. energy use and conservation and requires the federal government to reduce energy use in its buildings, setting up a ""green buildings"" performance standard.
   * A provision authored by Murkowski to promote improved appliances in cold weather states. The provision gives tax breaks to companies that design and build dual-fuel appliances that run on both conventional and renewable energy and gives tax credits to buyers under the national ""Energy Star"" program.
   Finally, in one of the few provisions that might increase traditional domestic energy production, the bill includes a provision authored by Murkowski and Sen. Ted Stevens that makes improvements in the operation of the Alaska Gas Pipeline Coordinator's Office to help speed regulatory approval for construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline project. The provision will grant the coordinator a waiver of federal personnel rules so the office can hire staff more quickly and includes a provision granting the coordinator the right to assess fees from a successful applicant to pay for permit reviews and regulation of the construction of a gas project to move Alaska natural gas to market.
   ""For Alaska, which has some of the best potential for renewable energy development in the nation, this bill, if finally passed and funded in a reasonable manner, offers the promise for lower-priced and cleaner energy in the future. Combined with the Energy Policy Act in 2005 that provided loan guarantees and assistance for nuclear, hydrogen fuel cell and coal gasification technology, plus aid for wind, solar, biomass and landfill gas, Congress has taken huge steps to promote alternative energy and energy efficiency.
   ""We still need to promote more conventional fuel production to help us bridge the gap until these new technologies can work. We still need to promote natural gas production from Alaska, open the Arctic coastal plain to oil development and work to increase natural gas production and revenue sharing from our offshore waters. I remain committed to press those goals in the future,"" concluded Murkowski.

MURKOWSKI, STABENOW, REPS. CAPPS, CUBIN INTRODUCE HEART FOR WOMEN ACT
  In celebration of Valentines Day and in honor of the importance of women's health, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rep. Lois Capps (D-CA) and Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-WY) today introduced the Heart Disease Education, Analysis and Research, and Treatment (HEART) for Women Act. This bill would improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease and stroke among women.
   ""In my State of Alaska - taken together - heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death, totaling nearly 800 deaths each year. Women in Alaska have higher death rates from stroke than do women nationally,"" said Murkowski. ""That is why I am pleased to join my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, to introduce important legislation, the HEART for Women Act, or Heart disease Education, Analysis and Research, and Treatment for Women Act. This important bill improves the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of heart disease and stroke in women so that we can reverse the disturbing statistics."" 
   ""Heart disease and stroke are the number one killers of American women today,"" Stabenow said. ""And while medical science has made great strides in reducing heart related deaths among men, the death rate for women from cardiovascular disease has actually gone up in the last 25 years. This is totally unacceptable. We all have to stop thinking of heart disease as a 'man's disease' and start insisting on improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of heart disease among women. By taking these simple steps in the fight against women's heart disease we will be able to ensure that even more of our mothers, sisters, daughters and friends are here to celebrate many Valentine's Days to come.""
   ""Few people realize that heart disease is the number one killer of women, and too many women pay the price for that lack of knowledge,"" Capps said. ""This bill would fill that gap, ensuring that all health care professionals have access to the latest research about the risks of cardiovascular disease in women - and how it affects women differently than men. Women nationwide need to have access to high-quality screenings for heart disease and stroke to help with early diagnosis and effective treatment. This bill will help ensure that is the case.""
   ""Heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular disease are the #1 killer of women in Wyoming,"" Cubin said. ""In fact, in Wyoming almost two women every day die from some type of cardiovascular disease. With increased awareness of these dangers and better prevention, Wyoming's future generations of women will not have to fear the dangers of cardiovascular disease.""
   One in three adult women suffers from some form of cardiovascular disease, and heart disease kills more women than the next five causes of death combined. Yet women are less likely than men to receive aggressive treatment for heart disease, a fact that isn't surprising given that less than one in five physicians recognize that more women die of heart disease each year then men.
   The Heart for Women Act takes a 3-pronged approach to reducing the cardiovascular disease death rate for women, through improved health education, gender specific analysis and research, and increased access to screening for women.
   Doctors need to know the facts about women and heart disease before they can be expected to properly treat them. The HEART for Women Act authorizes grants to educate doctors about the unique aspects of preventing, diagnosing and treating women with heart disease.
   Most research and analysis concerning heart disease has for too long ignored the fact that cardiovascular diseases affect women and men differently. This is why the HEART for Women Act also requires that the health information that is already being reported to the federal government be gender-specific, while calling for annual recommendations to Congress on ways to improve the treatment of heart disease for women.
   Finally, the HEART for Women Act focuses on the importance of heart disease screening among women by expanding a current program run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called WISEWOMAN. This program, currently available in only 14 states, provides free heart disease and stroke screenings to low-income uninsured women. By taking this program nationwide we will be able to give even more women the number one tool in fighting any disease, the ability for early detection.
   These are simple, cost-effective, but meaningful steps that Congress can take that will help get the death rate for women from heart disease and stroke going in the right direction--down. The HEART for Women Act is supported by a number of leading health and women's organizations, including the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the Society for Women's Health Research, WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease, Association of Women's Health Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, Association of Women's Heart Programs, Black Women's Health Imperative, Business and Professional Women/USA, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Jacobs Institute for Women's Health and General Federation of Women's Clubs.

""Their needs have been neglected for far too long. I am looking forward to the day when we can proudly fulfill our duty to our nation's First People."" 
   ""Much has been done to improve Alaska Native health care in the past decade. It is now the best of its kind in the nation,"" said Senator Stevens. ""However, Native health leaders from across our state have told me this legislation is critical because it contains new provisions to aid delivery of health care and services to all Native people. I urge my colleagues in Congress to get this bill to the President as soon as possible."" The Indian Health Care Improvement Act was last authorized in 1992. The bill takes a comprehensive approach to improving Indian health care, including:
   * Increasing the number of Indians entering health professions, 
   * Authorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund to address backlogs in health care services to Indians,
   * Authorizes Facilities Construction,
   * Addresses Social Security Act provisions,
   * Authorizes a variety of health services for urban Indians,
   * Makes organizational improvements within the Indian Health Services, and
   * Authorizes a variety of behavioral health programs.

MURKOWSKI VOTES TO DEFEND INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with the vast majority of her Republican colleagues in voting to advance a constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between one man and one woman. 
   Murkowski voted to begin Senate consideration of the defense of marriage amendment (Senate Joint Resolution 40) because she said the amendment was important to protect the will of the Alaska population, which by nearly a 70 percent margin approved a constitutional amendment in 1998 that defined marriage in Alaska as between one man and one woman.
   ""I support the traditional definition of marriage and I joined Alaskans in 1998 in defining marriage as between one man and one woman. I want to make sure that this decision by Alaskans remains the law of our state. For that reason I support the federal amendment. Without this amendment there is concern that by court decision, the U.S. Constitution's full faith and credit clause could override Alaska's Constitution on marriage,"" said Senator Murkowski in supporting the amendment.
   The amendment, which needed a 60-vote margin to clear a potential Democratic filibuster and then a two-thirds margin to be adopted and submitted to the states for ratification, would have bolstered the federal Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996 on an 85-14 vote in the Senate.
   The amendment was proposed after the Massachusetts Supreme Court this spring allowed same-sex marriages in that state. The Senate also took up the amendment because of legal challenges to the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman in states, such as Nebraska, which have adopted the same definition of marriage as adopted in Alaska. Four states, Alaska, Hawaii, Nebraska and Nevada have passed constitutional amendments defining marriage, while 38 other states have passed statutes defining/limiting marriage in some manner.
   The amendment failed to advance in the Senate on a 48-50 vote.
   ""Marriage is an important institution in our society and it should be protected. Secondly as a state's rights advocate, I don't believe any state should be able to determine the policies of another or be subjected to another state's laws that contradict their public policy,"" said Senator Murkowski.

MURKOWSKI PLEASED BY QUICK SIGNING OF GAS PIPELINE LOAN GUARANTEE, REGULATORY PROVISIONS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today praised President George Bush for quickly signing legislation into law granting a loan guarantee and making vital regulatory changes to enable construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline to proceed.  
   The President also welcomed the President's signature of her land bill for the City of Craig in Southeast that will aid economic development on Prince of Wales Island. 
   The President this morning signed the $10 billion military construction appropriation bill for FY '05 (H.R. 4837) into law. The Delegation over the weekend had won approval in the bill for an $18 billion loan guarantee to back construction of an Alaska natural gas project. It also had won vital regulatory and administrative changes in the bill, including streamlined permitting and expedited court review, the selection of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the lead agency for a single environmental review that must be finished within 18 months, and a $20 million job training program, including $3 million for a training center in Fairbanks, to guarantee that Alaskans get jobs from construction of the gas line. 
   ""It is wonderful news that the loan guarantee and the regulatory changes needed are now law. The changes should allow the largest construction project in the nation's history to proceed thanks to the fast action by President Bush. After working on these changes for the past two years, it is just wonderful news that Alaskans now know that the federal pieces of the pipeline puzzle are definitely in place,"" said Senator Murkowski after the President signed the bill. 
   The bill also includes a ban on a northern route for a pipeline, allows for the creation of the Office of Federal Coordinator for a gas pipeline, allows Alaska to control in-state use of the gas to facilitate use for heating of for a petrochemical industry in the state, and contains provisions to guarantee that current and future gas producers in Alaska will be able to compete to get their gas through the pipeline, plus provisions promoting local hire on the $20 billion project. 
   The military construction bill also funds $203.96 million in new military construction in Alaska including $60.7 million for a new barracks complex at Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks, $9 million for the next phase in the replacement of the Basset Army Hospital at the post; $28 million for a new large airframe hanger at Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage and $11.95 million for a new fitness center at the base. 
   With the signing in coming days of a major corporate tax bill, the FSC/ETI Jobs bill, that includes two additional gas line tax incentives, an accelerated depreciation provision and a credit to defray the cost of a North Slope gas conditioning plant, all of the federal incentives for a gas line will be in place. 
   Murkowski also thanked the President for signing another of her bills into law, this measure allowing the City of Craig to acquire the site for the former Wards Cove Packing Co. fish processing plant in downtown Craig as an industrial/economic development site in return for exchanging the Sunnahae property and trail in Craig to the U.S. Forest Service. By the deal the Forest Service is gaining a site for an expanded Craig ranger district. 
   The bill (S. 1776) helps the Forest Service buy 349 acres of trail, trailhead and parking areas for public use, while Craig will use the federal funding it is receiving to acquire the former cannery site - the prime area for economic development on central Prince of Wales Island. 
   ""With the slowdown in the timber industry on the island and the rough patchy that the fishing industry has been facing, residents have been struggling with how to both improve and diversify their economy. This trade opens the way for Craig to progress with efforts to help the town expand its economic base,"" said Murkowski.

MURKOWSKI WINS AMENDMENT ASKING HOMELAND SECURITY TO HIRE MORE ALASKA NATIVES, INDIANS TO WORK ON DISASTER RELIEF
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, in an effort to improve employment opportunities for Alaska Natives, Tuesday night won an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill encouraging the government to hire more Alaska and Hawaiian Natives and American Indians to help provide relief following national disasters.  
   The amendment, approved unanimously before the Senate approved its Homeland Security spending bill for FY '05, encourages the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide more employment opportunities for Natives to gain the temporary jobs that FEMA offers to provide relief assistance to those affected by hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires and earthquakes. 
   ""This amendment encourages the Secretary of Homeland Security to make a greater effort to improve the representation of American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians in the disaster relief cadres by actively recruiting in our Native communities. The goal is to encourage FEMA to be proactive in identifying opportunities to reduce unemployment among our qualified and motivated Native workforce,"" said Murkowski. 
   She noted that FEMA relies on some 4,000 part-time, temporary workers to fill disaster assistance jobs, jobs providing aid and helping with federal loans following disasters, such as the recent hurricane-caused damage in Florida. 
   ""The federal government transports these disaster reservists from their homes to the disaster site, houses them, pays a federal civil service wage for their services and returns them home at federal expense when their services are no longer needed. Given the unacceptably high unemployment rates in rural Alaska and on some reservations in the Lower 48, the government should do more to fill its employment needs from these workers. Natives who live in rural villages would find the opportunity for intermittent employment with FEMA desirable and such workers will do a wonderful job of helping their fellow Americans in time of need,"" said Murkowski. 
   She joined with Sen. Ted Stevens and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, in proposing and passing the amendment. The Senate late Tuesday completed action on the $33.1 billion homeland security bill sending it to a conference with the House to iron out differences on the measure.

MURKOWSKI, STEVENS ATTEMPT TO PREVENT COSTLY IMPACTS OF FUTURE TAPS QUALITY BANK OIL FIGHTS
  Saying they never want a repeat of the current 12-year legal wrangle over how oil flowing through the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline System (TAPS) is valued, Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens today introduced legislation to make all future federal oil valuation rulings apply only prospectively, preventing any party from facing huge retroactive charges in the future.  
   The measure is designed to protect the economics of in-state refineries to guarantee that Alaskans have access to locally produced fuels and to help protect the jobs of in-state refinery workers. 
   The legislation is designed to limit the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the future from assessing retroactive penalties on either the oil producers or oil refiners that utilize TAPS to move oil to market. It is a response to the complex legal battle over the TAPS Quality Bank, the mechanism that compensates individual oil producers for the effects of commingling their crude oil with that of different quality oil generated by other North Slope producers and to compensate them for changes in the oil stream caused when refineries take oil out of the pipeline to make in-state products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 
   ""The ongoing Quality Bank dispute has such serious implications for Alaska's energy future, we don't want this process ever to be repeated. Clearly companies should have the right to seek changes in the value of oil flowing through the pipeline and changes in future tariffs, but any changes in the valuation methodologies should be levied prospectively, not over long periods retroactively. No business can exist if they buy raw product, manufacture it into finished goods, sell them and then are told 12 years later that they should in effect have paid far more for their raw materials,"" said Senator Lisa Murkowski. 
   ""Markets for all commodities change over time and no business should be subject to such whims. We have to make this process work better in the future, than it has in the past,"" said Senator Murkowski. 
   ""The Quality Bank was created to balance accounts among oil producers on Alaska's North Slope who produce crude oil of different quality and value from different oil fields, and also applies to oil refineries who receive needed crude oil from TAPS. The methodology used to determine these payments has been the subject of dispute since the Bank's inception, creating uncertainty in the market and a chilling effect on business investment in Alaska,"" said Senator Stevens. 
   ""The current case involving the Quality Bank puts Alaska's in-state refineries at risk at a time when the United States can ill afford to lose its limited refining capacity; there needs to be a solution in order to prevent future litigation,"" said Stevens. 
   The legislation is an outgrowth to a suit that challenged FERC's decision in 1993 to switch from the former ""gravity"" method of valuing the quality of oil arriving at Valdez to a new ""distillation"" methodology, which values crude oil based on the market price of various types of products that can be refined from the oil stream. After repeated legal proceedings, an Administrative Law Judge just last August issued a series of decisions changing the Quality Bank methodology and said his rulings should apply retroactively back to 1993 - years before any of the parties could have reasonably expected any valuation methodology change to take effect. 
   While the new legislation should not specifically affect the existing legal dispute; it is designed to prospectively -- effective after Dec. 31, 2005 -- prevent FERC from assessing monetary adjustments retroactively against any of the parties involved in the Quality Bank process. That is designed to protect Conoco-Phillips, BP, Exxon-Mobil, the other smaller oil producers on the North Slope, the State of Alaska and the states' two in-state refineries, Petro Star and Flint Hills from facing huge retroactive liabilities should FERC-issued valuation methodologies be changed in the future. 
   ""The goal of this legislation is to eliminate the risk and uncertainty associated with unlimited retroactive application of Quality Bank rules. This will allow all Quality Bank participants to be able to conduct business with the certainty of knowing that prices received and paid for oil today can't be altered years down the road. This should discourage all sides from engaging in endless litigation in hopes of gaining windfall profits. This will end the current litigation lottery where Alaskans stand to be the real losers,"" said Murkowski, noting that unpredictable liabilities in the current bank rules threaten the health of both in-state refineries, the locally produced fuels that have helped businesses in-state flourish and the more than 400 jobs of workers at the refineries near Fairbanks. 
   The Senators noted that the refineries, especially, need more certainty when attempting to raise the huge amounts of capital to pay for improvements needed to produce ultra clean diesel fuels now mandated by the government. 
   The Senators said the effective date for the legislation was set at Dec. 31, 2005 to give FERC and all parties a fair amount of time to hammer out a just settlement of the existing dispute. To that end the Alaska Delegation, both Senators and Congressman Don Young, Thursday sent a letter to FERC asking that the commission speed up its consideration of the Administration Law Judge's ruling and attempt to fashion an equitable solution for all parties of the existing Quality Bank dispute quickly. The Delegation six months ago in report language first put the parties on notice of their concern over the Quality Bank proceeding, urging the Commission to implement a fair tariff and encouraging all the parties to reach a just out-of-court settlement of the dispute.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today re-introduced legislation to clarify the status of villages participating in the federally established Community Development Quota (CDQ) program created to assist economically disadvantaged communities around the edge of the Bering Sea.  
   The act, S.797, which is co-sponsored by fellow Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, is required because of technical provisions in the 1996 reauthorization of the CDQ law that will require a reassessment of the eligibility of the 65 communities currently covered by the CDQ program - an assessment that might eliminate some of the communities from qualifying for the regional fishing quota system. In order to clarify that fact, a legislative remedy is needed. 
   ""Clearly it was not the intent of the original law for any of these fishing communities to be excluded from the benefits of the CDQ program,"" said Murkowski. ""But because of regulatory provisions a reassessment of eligibility will occur in the future that could exclude some villages from the program. We can't afford to let that happen."" 
   The Community Development Quota Program began in 1992, at the recommendation of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Congress gave the program permanent status in the 1996 reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The program now includes 65 communities within a 50 nautical-mile radius of the Bering Sea, which have formed six regional non-profit associations to participate in the program. 
   Since 1992, approximately 9,000 jobs have been created for western Alaska residents with wages totaling more than $60 million. The CDQ program has also contributed to fisheries infrastructure development in Western Alaska, as well as providing vessel loan programs, education, training and other CDQ-related benefits. 
   ""The CDQ program helps bring some of the benefits of our great industry to local residents, in one of the most impoverished areas in the country. It is a vital element in the effort to create and maintain a lasting economic base for the region's many poor communities,"" said Murkowski.

   The bill, called the Natural Stock Conservation Act, (S.796) would prohibit the development of new offshore aquaculture operations until Congress acts to ensure that every federal agency involved does the necessary analyses in areas such as disease control, engineering, pollution prevention, biological and genetic impacts, economic and social effects, and other critical issues. None of these are specifically required under existing law. 
   The bill also requires that federal agencies consult with the governor of any state near the aquaculture site, and that permits be approved by the regional fishery management council with jurisdiction in the region. 
   ""Scientists, the media and the public are awakening to the serious disadvantages of fish raised in fish farming operations compared to naturally healthy wild fish species, such as Alaska salmon, halibut, sablefish, crab and many other species,"" said Murkowski. ""We cannot afford a rush to judgment on this issue - it is far too dangerous if we make a mistake. This issue deserves the same level of scrutiny by Congress as the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for other sweeping changes in ocean governance."" 
   Murkowski also voiced concerns over reports that the Administration is in the final stages of preparing a draft bill to allow offshore aquaculture development to occur. ""We have only rumors about what may be in that draft bill,"" said Murkowski. ""The administration has had meetings on the general topic of aquaculture, but has done little or nothing to work with those of us who represent fishing constituencies in the development of the specifics that will appear in the draft bill."" 
   In closing Murkowski said, ""We all want to make sure we enjoy abundant supplies of healthy foods in the future, but not if it means unnecessary and avoidable damage to wild species, to the environment generally, and to the economies of America's coastal fishing communities.""

   The bill has been of great interest to Doyon, Limited, the regional Native Corporation for Alaska's Interior, and Sealaska Corporation, the regional Native Corporation for Southeast Alaska, which had hoped to obtain shareholder approval to make new stock available in 2006.

MURKOWSKI CHALLENGES EPA OVER PROPOSED BUDGET CUTS TO ALASKA VILLAGE SAFE WATER
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today expressed grave concerns regarding the Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2007 budget cuts in the EPA program that addresses the basic drinking water and sewer needs of Alaskan villages.  
   Murkowski's comments came during a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing to address the proposed EPA budget. 
   ""The proposed reduction in the President's budget unfairly punishes Alaska Natives and other rural Alaska residents for shortcomings that both the State of Alaska and EPA are working to address,"" Murkowski told EPA Administrator Steve Johnson at the hearing. ""I want your commitment to help ensure that OMB recognizes the work underway to improve this critically important program."" 
   The Administration is proposing a 75 percent reduction in funding to the State of Alaska's Village Safe Water Program, which provides matching funds and works with non-profit and other federal agencies to ensure that this funding gets to the communities that truly need it. The Village Safe Water Program receives funding from two federal agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Administration. The Administration has proposed a 57 percent reduction to the EPA program and an elimination of funding to the Department of Agriculture's program. 
   At Murkowski's request, made during last year's EPA budget hearing, Administration officials traveled to Alaska to visit rural Alaska Native communities. ""I am pleased that Claude Allen, the President's former top domestic policy advisor, and the Administrator were able to visit the villages of Kasigluk, Atmautluak, and Nunapitchuk, among other Alaska communities, last August,"" said Murkowski. ""As they saw during their visit, the water and sewer conditions in these communities often rival the conditions in third-world countries."" 
   The lack of sanitation in rural villages has a startling effect on the health of the residents of these communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control, infants in villages with less than 10 percent of homes with water service are 11 times more likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia and five times more likely to be hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections.

MURKOWSKI JOINS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO COMBAT BREAST CANCER
  Senator Lisa Murkowski has joined a bipartisan effort to combat breast cancer by signing on as an original sponsor of The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2007. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act would establish a national strategy to study the links between the environment and breast cancer. This legislation would authorize the National Institutes of Health to develop a peer reviewed research program of grants for the establishment of collaborative centers of research to study environmental factors that are believed to contribute to the development of breast cancer.  
   ""With 3 million women living with breast cancer today, the disease is taking a serious toll on the entire nation,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Unfortunately, the causes of breast cancer are largely unknown. While less than 30% of breast cancers are explained by known risk factors, there is little consensus in the scientific community on how the environment impacts breast cancer. This legislation will support important research that could be valuable in understanding the causes of breast cancer and lead to prevention strategies."" 
   Breast cancer will strike one in eight American women in her lifetime, meaning that almost 275,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed annually. It kills more than 40,000 people each year. 
   The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act will ensure that scientists have the resources needed to explore the relationship between the environment and breast cancer. It would boost the research investment on the role of the environment in the development of breast cancer and also establish a national research strategy. Specifically, it would authorize $40 million each year for Fiscal Years 2008 - 2012 to establish multi-institutional, multidisciplinary Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Centers of Excellence. Each Center would include institutions with different areas of expertise working together as well as collaborating with community organizations in the area. Modeled after the tremendously successful Breast Cancer Research Program at the Department of Defense, grants would be awarded under a competitive, peer-reviewed process that involves patient advocates.

MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR ALASKA SALMON FISHERMEN
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced today that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is inviting public comment on the renewal of petitions for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) that were originally approved for benefits in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.  
 This comment period affects those salmon fishermen in Alaska who have applied for TAA. 
   The USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) must determine annually if trade and economic conditions warrant a petition's renewal. FAS will consider the comments and determine whether to re-certify the petitions in fiscal year 2006. 
   ""I encourage Alaska's salmon fishermen to provide comment during this period,"" Sen. Murkowski said. ""Public input is important to the continuation of this necessary aid."" 
   Under the TAA program, USDA provides technical assistance to farmers and fisherman adversely affected by imports of foreign farmed commodities. Traditionally, the TAA program has only applied to American farmers affected by imported foreign crops. In 2003, Alaska's Congressional Delegation was successful in advocating that TAA also apply to salmon fishermen as the industry, particularly in Alaska, has been hit hard by farmed imports from South America. 
   Comments regarding petition re-certification should be sent by fax to Jean-Louis Pajot, Coordinator, Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers, FAS, USDA, at (202) 720-0876, or by email at trade.assistance@fas.usda.gov.

STEVENS, MURKOWSKI JOINED BY SEN. DOMENICI, INTERIOR SECRETARY NORTON, ALASKA INUPIAT IN SUPPORT OF ANWR DEVELOPMENT
  Today Sens. Ted Stevens and Lisa Murkowski were joined by Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and three members of the Alaska Inupiat community spoke in support of drilling on the Arctic Coastal Plain.  
   As the Senate debated the 2006 budget, Stevens and Murkowski held a press conference to encourage the Senate to keep the provision opening ANWR to oil and gas exploration in the budget. This language is crucial to having Congress keep its 1980 commitment to Alaska and to reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and increasing our nation's energy security. 
   ""I do believe that our dependence on foreign oil is a direct threat to our national security. People fail to realize that our dependence on rogue states and militant nations makes us weak,"" stated Stevens. ""In 2004 we imported more than 60% of our oil from abroad. That is an increase of 33% since 1970. Importing our energy from one unstable regime is a direct threat to our national security. This dependence on outside sources makes our country vulnerable to whims of the rogue nations. OPEC's decision to impose the 1973 oil embargo was retribution for our foreign policy in the Middle East war. We must head the lessons of history. Even today OPEC meets in Iran to decide the future of oil prices for the world."" Senator Stevens was followed by Oliver Leavitt, Vice President of Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and a resident of Barrow, Alaska. Mr. Leavitt was joined by fellow Inupiat and Barrow resident Richard Glenn and Desiree Kaveolook, of Kaktovik. 
   Mr. Leavitt led the group of Alaska Inupiat by stating ""We believe in the development because at first we were opposed to construction of the pipeline. We were afraid for the caribou because we were afraid it would impede its movement. It has not, the caribou have flourished...That shows that even with development that they can flourish...We have formed the North Slope Borough, we are vigilant in our development. It has helped and our lives have changed. We lived in third-world conditions until Prudhoe Bay was discovered and now we live a lot better."" 
   ""This land is not wilderness; our people have lived on the Arctic Slope region... for countless generations So to type this land as wilderness is inaccurate. And finally, we are aware that exploration can be done in a way that respects our environment. We depend on fish and caribou for food, we depend on economic development for our infrastructure that helps improve our quality of life, so we want this balance of stewardship and development. We don't roll over for development; we are vigilant about it...if you watch the way development is done now it is done with out a mark. So let's explore the Coastal Plain and find out what is there,"" said Glenn, Vice President of Lands for Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. 
   One of the most poignant speakers was 18 year-old Desiree Kaveolook, a University of Alaska Fairbanks freshman. Kaktovik is the only community the lies with the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain, the area of ANWR proposed for oil exploration. Ms. Kaveolook stated, ""I live in Kaktovik, the only community that lies within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Alaska Federation of Natives, which supports thousands of Alaska Natives made a statewide resolution that supports oil exploration and development in ANWR. Not only is AFN in support, but so are the North Slope Borough, the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and the native village of Kaktovik."" Ms. Kaveolook further stated that ""With safe on-shore drilling there would be increased opportunities for today's youth [on the North Slope] such as scholarship opportunities, therefore allowing young people such as myself the opportunity to attend college and seek high education."" 
   Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton continued to vocalize the support of President George Bush and the Bush Administration. ""The Administration continues to strongly support the proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain...The President has spoken recently about this in context of the importance of energy for America's future,"" Norton said. 
   Senate Energy Committee Chairman Peter Domenici (R-NM) recently led a tour of Senators and Cabinet officials to ANWR, Barrow and the NPR-A to see how the low-impact development of Alaska's resources would take place in ANWR. It was significant to him to see that the ice roads and the directional drilling techniques kept the environmental impact to a minimum. Senator Domenici was fervent in his statement that, ""I have concluded that the safest place in the world to produce oil and natural gas in an environmentally safe and sound way, is to do it in Alaska. It is time to wake up. It is time for America to wake up. We are in a terrible, terrible predicament. This country is now at the mercy of oil from over seas. This is terrible dependence and it is growing worse. 
   Senator Lisa Murkowski echoed the statements of her colleagues and fellow Alaskans when she asked ""At what point do we say that we as a nation are going to take responsibility for our energy and do what we can to bring about some energy security? What about economic security? The jobs that will be created, the jobs that will not be exported overseas by the exploration of our resource."" She further stated ""And what about environmental security? You have heard from the native peoples that live there. They don't roll over for economic development. Their children, my children who live in the state of Alaska demand appropriate environmental safeguards. If we are going to drill, if we are going to produce up there we are only going to do it right."" 
   Following the statements made by the Senators, the Alaska Inupiat and the Secretary of the Interior the group received a question regarding drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. Senator Domenici and Secretary Norton expressed the opinion that the Congress would only support off-shore drilling in localities where the drilling was wanted. Senator Stevens agrees with the position of the Administration. Thus far the Bristol Bay Native Corporation is the only Alaska group that supports this form off drilling off their shores. Senator Stevens supports their position and no other drilling in Alaska waters.

MURKOWSKI PUSHES TO OPEN ANWR ON SENATE FLOOR
  Tonight, Sen. Lisa Murkowski went to the Senate Floor to push for the continued inclusion of ANWR revenue in the FY06 Budget Resolution. During the debate on Sen. Maria Cantwell's (D-WA) amendment to strike ANWR from the budget, Sen. Murkowski said the following:  
   ""With the potential that we have in ANWR right now - to suggest, that this amount of oil is not going to help this country, is akin to suggesting that all of the oil that we receive from East Texas wasn't worth it because it alone wasn't able to sustain this country, and alone it wasn't able to give us the energy independence that we need. Similarly, discounting ANWR's likely oil is like saying that we as a nation should never have bothered opening up the Prudhoe Bay oil field... 
   ""Let's talk about the economics of it. In terms of our ability to stabilize our oil prices we will be generating more than $30 billion in federal revenues, probably several billion dollars within four years of opening ANWR. We are also talking about our deficit as we're dealing with the budget here - opening ANWR will be reducing the balance of our payments of deficit because we're not going to be buying as much oil overseas. Last year alone we paid nearly $166 billion to buy oil overseas. This is a quarter of our trade deficit. Further, American farmers alone lost $6.2 billion because of higher fuel and fertilization costs. So we recognize. We've got an opportunity to make a difference... 
   ""My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have talked a lot about the effect (of opening ANWR to oil and gas exploration) on the environment. I live there. My family lives there. I'm the last person in the world that wants to see my state spoiled. I want to make sure that what we do when it comes to development is going to be done in balance with our environment. And you know what? We figured out how to do that on the North Slope. We have seen a tenfold increase in the Central Arctic caribou herd since Prudhoe was opened 30 years ago... 
   ""I challenge anyone anywhere to come up with more stringent standards when it comes to development and Alaska will beat them every time. And I will suggest to you that we need to be global environmentalists. If we're not taking the oil form ANWR, we will still get oil from somewhere else. And if we don't take it in an area where we know we're going to monitor it and do it correctly, it will come to the U.S. from overseas, from Russia, from Venezuela, from Africa where they don't care for their environment. So, to use the phrase from the other side we need to ""think globally but act locally."" ANWR is the perfect of example to do just that."" 
   Debate on the amendment to strike ANWR from the FY06 Budget Resolution will continue tomorrow, Wednesday, March 16.

MURKOWSKI VISITS NEW ORLEANS, SURROUNDING REGION
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today traveled to Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana to speak at a ceremony to dedicate the arrival and installation of a 16-ton marine travel lift donated by the City of Valdez.  
   ""All of us who witnessed, from afar, the devastation that occurred from the hurricanes were motivated to help,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""That is why when I asked the Alaska fishing industry to lend a hand we had no trouble finding willing volunteers and contributions for our effort."" 
   Senator Murkowski was joined by Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who said, ""The people of Louisiana are grateful to Senator Murkowski and all our friends in Alaska who have given us so much more than a travel lift for our fisheries. They have also given us comfort knowing we are not alone in our rebuilding efforts following the greatest disaster in our nation's history. I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the Senate to provide new tools and initiatives as we rebuild Louisiana and the entire Gulf Coast together."" 
   Within days of Hurricane Katrina, Senator Murkowski helped form the Alaska Fishing Industry Relief Mission (AFIRM). The organization represents the fishing, processing, financial, transportation and logistics sectors of the Alaska fishing industry. AFIRM, which helped coordinate the delivery and logistics for the donation, exists solely to help Gulf Coast fishing communities continue operations as quickly as possible. 
   Today, with the arrival of the massive marine travel lift, Alaska's efforts are paying off for the fishing community of Plaquemines Parish. ""Hundreds of fishing boats were forced onto dry land or sunk by the powerful hurricanes,"" Plaquemines Parish President Benny Rousselle explained. ""We've experienced great devastation. Out of all the economic sectors affected, the commercial fishing community has been the hardest hit. Many of these fishermen have nothing left but their boats. The value of this donation is beyond words."" 
   Federal, state and local governments have been hauling boats out of bayous, backyards and parking lots and stockpiling them on dry land. But there has been no way to put the boats back into the water. The boatyard lost its launching equipment in the storms, and new equipment could not be obtained quickly. The travel lift, which served the City of Valdez for years, is capable of lifting a 60-ton fishing boat and replacing it gently in the water. 
   In addition to visiting Plaquemines Parish, Senator Murkowski and Senator Landrieu also toured New Orleans to witness and assess rebuilding efforts. Additionally, the Senators toured energy facilities in Port Fourchon, the largest oil port in the Gulf.

MURKOWSKI, STEVENS, SCHUMER, SANDERS INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE CRISIS
  Noting that our Nation faces a severe shortage of primary care physicians, Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined Sens. Ted Stevens (R-AK), Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in introducing the Physician Shortage Elimination Act. The legislation provides additional funding and flexibility for existing residency programs, grants and services that have been successful in the past but have been underutilized. 
   A dozen states have already reported significant physician shortages. There is insufficient availability of care in specialty areas like cardiology, radiology and neurology. However, the greatest shortages persistently have been in primary care. In rural areas of the country, where 50 million Americans live in areas that lack sufficient care, it represents one of the most intractable health policy problems of the past century.  
   Unfortunately, it is a problem that is forecast to get worse. In just 20 years, 20 percent of the Nation's population will be 65 years or older, a percentage larger than any other time in history. Just as this aging population places the highest demand on our health care system, some experts predict a national shortage of 200,000 physicians. If that becomes reality, 84 million patients could be left without a doctor's care. 
   ""The physician shortage facing Alaska - and the nation as a whole - is intolerable,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Congress cannot idly sit by while potentially millions of patients go without care."" 
   ""Advances in medicine have greatly improved the healthcare available throughout the country,"" said Senator Stevens. ""But today, as more and more patients seek treatment, fewer physicians are available to help meet their needs. It is imperative that Congress act now to address this growing problem facing Alaska and the nation. I applaud Senator Murkowski's leadership on this issue and look forward to working with her and my Senate colleagues to get this bill passed."" 
   ""National demand for physicians has grown to exceed the supply, particularly in upstate New York,"" said Senator Schumer. ""With general practitioners, surgeons, and specialty doctors leaving the area in record numbers, patients could see an erosion of access to care at the worst possible time. We need to provide direct incentives to train and retain physicians in order to keep our community and our overall economy healthy."" 
   ""Our country is currently facing a real health care crisis and the shortage of physicians in rural areas is a significant part of the problem,"" said Senator Sanders. ""This bill will go a long way toward improving health care access for all Americans."" The Physician Shortage Elimination Act provides additional investments in programs that have been effective in attracting and retaining physicians to serve in our most underserved areas of the country. Specifically the bill will: 
   * Double funding for the National Health Service Corp - a program that is dedicated to meeting the needs of the underserved. Despite its success, it has been vastly under funded - in fact 80% of the applicants must be turned away each year. 
   * Allow rural and underserved physician residency programs to expand by removing barriers that prevent programs from developing rural training programs. 
   * Double certain Title VII funding to create programs that target disadvantaged youth in rural and underserved areas and nurture them to create a ""pipeline"" to careers in healthcare; and 
   * Bolster the cornerstone for health care in underserved areas, the community health center, through grants and by allowing them to expand their residency programs.

MURKOWSKI, OBAMA INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO BAN EXPORT OF MERCURY
  In an effort to protect Alaska's wild fish stocks, Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) to introduce legislation to ban the export of elemental mercury, a neurotoxin that can harm fetuses and young children if it continues to accumulate in the environment. The Mercury Market Minimization Act would prohibit the export of Mercury from the United States starting in 2010 in order to reduce its frequently uncontrolled use in developing nations. The European Union has already taken similar steps to ban the export of Mercury. 
   Additionally, to aid businesses holding stockpiles of mercury in excess of the amount needed for proper uses, it sets up a commission to study whether the United States should establish a mercury storage reserve. Such a reserve would relieve firms of the expense and liability of storage of the metal in the future and help keep it from leaking into the nation's groundwater and air supplies.  
   ""Given our expanding knowledge about the health impacts of elemental mercury when it enters the atmosphere, this is a common-sense approach to slow needless mercury emissions, especially in the developing world,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Coming from a state that is a major seafood producer, I believe it is imperative that we safeguard the environment from the unnecessary release of mercury that can affect fish and potentially those who eat fish. We have never had a real problem with mercury contamination in Alaska's seafood and this ban on exports to slow the introduction of mercury from Third World nations into the atmosphere can help maintain our excellent safety record."" 
   ""The more we learn about mercury, the more we discover how harmful it is to our health,"" said Senator Obama. ""While the United States has become more vigilant in collecting and containing mercury, it remains one of the leading exporters of this dangerous product. This legislation would cause the U.S. to lead by example, encouraging other nations to eliminate their dependence on mercury."" 
   The ban on mercury exports is not a ban on the production of mercury should it be produced as part of mining operations in the United States. While there are no current mercury mines left in Alaska, mercury sometimes is produced as a by-product of gold or other mining, and that mercury can be sold for valid domestic purposes. 
   The ban on exports is designed to curb the shipment of mercury to developing nations where it can be burned in industrial purposes or as a low-cost means of placer gold recovery, which releases it into the global atmosphere where it can eventually contaminate U.S. lakes and rivers and ocean currents. Mercury in water can then bio-accumulate in fish, becoming more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. 
   While global production of new mercury is down markedly since 2000, a ban might slow Chinese and Indian usage of mercury in industrial settings. China currently uses about 1,500 tons a year, of the 3,000 to 4,000 tons of new mercury produced each year, to make low-cost PVC plastic pipe. In the Americas, Brazilian gold miners also release large amounts of mercury by burning it to help recover placer gold. 
   The ban should have no negative effects on Alaska industry, but could well aid seafood in the future by markedly slowing the release of mercury where it can affect future seafood harvests. Already in recent years there have been warnings to discourage pregnant women and children from eating some seafood products because of the fear of mercury contamination. 
   ""We in Alaska don't have a problem with mercury in our seafood, and this bill will help keep it that way,"" said Murkowski.

MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FEDERAL FIRE RESTORATION FUNDING
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski this morning welcomed the announcement by Secretary of the Interior Gail Norton that Alaska will receive $8.6 million to pay for restoration efforts on much of the 6.4 million acres of Alaska burned in wildfires this summer.  
   Murkowski since the fires has been seeking funding from the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to stabilize the burned areas, to prevent erosion that could harm watersheds, and where necessary, to fund reseeding to speed regeneration of trees in the Interior areas racked by Alaska's worst fire season. 
   ""I'm pleased that the Departments cooperatively have committed the funds to help speed our recovery from the devastating fires. We have work that needs to be done both this winter and important follow-up work that will be needed in the spring. Having adequate funding is the key to avoiding additional damage and helping the Interior's forests recover more rapidly from the fires,"" said Murkowski, who met with Secretary Norton for a series of announcements in Anchorage on Friday. 
   Murkowski noted that the $8.6 million in aid comes on top of $500,000 in immediate assistance provided late this summer by the Agriculture Department to rural communities, Native villages and corporations for stabilization efforts in community watersheds. Murkowski said she may well be seeking even more assistance for the state and private land owners since the $8.6 million by law can't be spent on state and private lands. 
   ""My personal goal will be to also secure more funding to assist those areas burned on state and private lands. Fire knows no boundaries and the results from this fire season indicate that 32 percent of the land that burned was state-owned land, while 12 percent was Native-owned lands,"" said Murkowski. 
   She also said she supports a complete review of the fire suppression zones and management structure outlined in the Alaska Interagency Fire Management Plan before next summer's fire season arrives. ""I have concerns regarding the suppression zone classifications in the state and want the public to understand this process and why response times for fighting fires differ in different parts of the state. 
   ""Alaskans clearly have concerns about these suppression zone categories. This is a statewide issue that needs to be addressed this winter before another fire season is upon us,"" said Murkowski, noting the concerns of some Tok residents about why fires in parts of their area were allowed to burn unchecked - the fires then threatening homes and buildings. 
   Murkowski joined Norton for the presentation of awards to federal and state officials who worked on a Cannery Creek fish passage project. She also participated in the signing of a renewal of an Alaska Native hire utilization agreement between the Department and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co, owner of the Trans-Alaska (oil) Pipeline System(TAPS). The pipeline companies back in 1972 agreed to hire Alaska Natives for operation and maintenance of the pipeline. The ceremony marked Alyeska fully meeting the ""Title 29"" hiring goals of having more than 20 percent Native employees working on pipeline operations. The signing marked a renewal of the agreement for future years.

MURKOWSKI DISAPPOINTED BY DEMOCRATIC WALKOUT BEFORE DEBATE ON ALASKA LAND BILLS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today said she was disappointed by a Democratic walkout at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that prevented a quorum delaying consideration of two of her Alaska bills, one involving a land exchange involving the Cape Fox Native Village Corp. of Saxman and a second bill aimed at speeding up conveyance of 89 million acres of lands promised to the state and Alaska Native corporations decades ago. 
   Murkowski said she was disappointed, but not surprised by the display of rank partisan politics in this election year. She said, however, she was even more appalled by the inaccurate justification voiced at the conclusion of the committee meeting by some that she had not worked to address Democratic concerns about the two measures.  
   ""I understand that there is always pressure to deny a senator up for election any accomplishments during an election cycle. It is petty, childish and grossly unfair to the citizens of Alaska, but it is an unfortunate reflection of life in the U.S. Senate. Sometimes it is easier to use a parliamentary tactic than to express your arguments in public and let the majority decide legislation on its merits. But it is absolutely incorrect to say that I have not worked tirelessly to attempt to meet Democratic and public concerns about both pieces of legislation,"" said Murkowski. 
   Concerning the Cape Fox bill Murkowski said there is no justification to argue it has not been fully reviewed by Congress. She noted a similar bill passed the Senate on Nov. 22, 2002, that the current bill was the subject of an Anchorage field hearing in August 2003, of a formal committee hearing in February of this year and of a town hall meeting held in Juneau last September. She noted that a similar bill also has already cleared the House Resources Committee this year, after passing the House in the 107th Congress. 
   Murkowski said she has attempted to address Democratic staff concerns about the bill, specifically proposing amendments to protect the forested scenic views on the west side of Berners Bay by adding a provision to guarantee that at least 75 percent of all standing timber in the area be fully protected. She also added a provision to guarantee continued public access along and within 75 feet of the shoreline for kayakers, boaters, hikers and berry pickers in the area. 
   The bill itself (S. 1354) is a land exchange designed to address the inequity involving the Cape Fox Corp. of Saxman, which was precluded in 1971 from selecting its Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Lands within 6 miles of Ketchikan. The bill would allow Cape Fox to return 160 acres of mountainous selections and gain 99 acres of land adjacent to its current holdings on Revilla Island near Ketchikan. 
   The bill also allows Cape Fox and the Sealaska Native regional corporation to enter into an equal value land exchange where the corporations would gain surface and subsurface estate on lands around patented mining claims at the Kensington and Jualin gold mines north of Juneau in return for giving up other lands in Southeast. The land exchange will allow Cape Fox to benefit from development of the mine, while Sealaska will gain access to ancient burial and cultural sites. The exchange will create additional opportunities for development of the mines with Cape Fox and Sealaska involvement. 
   Cape Fox will receive an annual lease fee for their land during construction and operation of the mine, with mine operation likely producing 225 direct jobs, 180 indirect jobs and a $16 million annual payroll for Juneau's economy over the expected at least 15-year operating life of the Kensington mine. It also offers excellent opportunities for increased Native hire. 
   Concerning the land acceleration bill, she said the measure has undergone two committee hearings, in August. 2003 and again on Feb.12, 2004. She noted that she has proposed to make dozens of changes to the bill to address Democratic committee staff and public comments on the measure - changes that would have been debated and likely accepted by the committee, if today's ""markup"" session had not been boycotted by Democrats. She added she has been seeking to work with committee staff since February to iron out all language changes - Democratic staff refusing to meet on the bill until mid July in an obvious attempt to delay passage of the measure for as long as possible. 
   The bill (S. 1466) is intended to lay out a blueprint for the federal Bureau of Land Management to complete the surveying and final transfer of 89 million acres, 60 million of the state's outstanding 104-million-acre Statehood entitlement and the remaining 29 million acres of the 44 million acres given to Alaska Native Corporations under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The bill also addresses steps to complete the transfer of some 2,500 of 16,000 total parcels of native land applications made under terms of the 1906 Alaska Native Land Allotment Act. 
   Murkowski noted she has made a host of changes to accommodate not just Democratic, but public and interest group concerns with the original measure. They include: 
   * Limiting the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior to settle State land claims by agreement. 
   * Deleting a provision that would have allowed closed mining claims to be conveyed to the state because some environmental groups argued that would have increased the size of the state's overall Statehood land entitlement. 
   * Deleting a provision that would have allowed the University of Alaska system to select the reversionary interest in properties owned by non-profit groups. 
   * Amending a provision concerning outdated withdrawals of public lands, so the bill now calls for a public land nomination process, an assessment of nominated lands and a report to Congress so it will make a decision on the future of nominated lands, in place of the original provision which would have immediately opened all such lands to all public land laws. 
   * The addition of language to a provision authorizing conveyance of about 2,000-acres of land owed to the Village of Kaktovik clarifying that the authorization to convey does not allow oil or gas development of lands inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until Congress acts to permit energy development on the Arctic coastal plain. 
   * Deleting of a provision that would have waived a 69,129-acre limitation on conveyance of lands within pre-ANCSA refuges to address environmental concerns. 
   * And the addition of a provision to ease environmental concerns allowing Native corporations and allotment applicants to adjust boundaries of allotment claims to clarify that such relocations may only occur when the move does not create a future management problem for Conservation System Unit land managers. 
   ""With little cooperation, we have gone out of our way to try to accommodate staff and public concerns with the original draft of this bill. It is a truly unfair criticism to say that I have not worked hard to meet all valid concerns with the land transfer acceleration bill. 
   ""It would appear that the walkout was a thinly disguised attempt at partisan politics,"" said Murkowski, noting that Democratic committee staff went so far as to hurry one Democratic Senator out of the room when her entrance would have constituted a quorum that would have allowed the committee to report both bills to the floor. Murkowski said she will continue to work to try to have the bills reconsidered next week.

MURKOWSKI WINS SENATE APPROVAL OF CRAIG LAND BILL
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today won approval for legislation that will allow the City of Craig to acquire the site of the former Wards Cove Packing Company's fish processing plant in downtown Craig in return for exchanging the Sunnahae property and trail in Craig to the U.S. Forest Service.  
   The exchange, co-sponsored by Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, involves the Forest Service buying the 349 acres of trail, trailhead and parking area, along with mountaintop property. Craig then will use the federal funding to acquire the 221,000-square-foot site (on 10 acres) of the former cannery, located on the waterfront at Third and Main Streets. The site is the prime location for economic, commercial or industrial development in central Prince of Wales Island. 
   The exchange was modified in the committee to also have the government acquire two additional small parcels next to the existing Craig Ranger Office. The additional tracts will help the Forest Service have more space for administrative functions and alleviate its current situation of having the ranger station being in an in-holding surrounded by private, state and city-owned lands. The main exchange will allow the Forest Service to acquire a prime recreation and hiking trail that leads to Mount Sunnahae, located east of Craig, plus a large recreation track on the north side of the mountain. 
   The bill also was modified in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in April to require the City of Craig to split the cost with the Forest Service of an independent appraisal of the prospective tracts that each will acquire. 
   Murkowski said she advanced the bill at the request of island residents to aid Prince of Wales residents diversify their economy to overcome the losses caused by the downturn in the area's timber industry. 
   ""This exchange is critical to the future of Craig. It will provide a great management tool to the Forest Service and increased recreational opportunities for the local and visiting public,"" said Murkowski. ""Given the downturn in timber, it is vital for the economy that the Community of Craig has the opportunity to develop the largest tract left inside its city limits. It is really the only site with the potential to attract industrial or commercial business to Craig,"" she said. 
   The legislation also allows for an appropriation of $250,000 to the Forest Service for trail maintenance and rehabilitation on the property. The bill (S. 1778) was approved unanimously and now heads to the House of Representatives for its consideration.

MURKOWSKI'S NATIVE ALLOTMENT SUBDIVISION BILL
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today guided her bill to help resolve a problem affecting Alaska Natives who wish to subdivide their land holdings through the Senate.  
   The Senate unanimously approved her Native Allotment Subdivision Act (S. 1421). The bill now heads to the House of Representatives for its review. 
   The bill solves a problem faced by Native landowners, who acquired lands under the Native Allotment Act of 1906. Those owners do not now have the ability to subdivide their lands or to dedicate rights-of-way across their lands for public access or for utility purposes. The issue threatens the ability of Natives, who own more than 11,000 Native allotment parcels in the state, to freely subdivide their private property like all other Alaskans. 
   ""I'm glad the Senate has approved this to fix the quirk in Federal law where Alaska Natives may not be able to use their land as freely as other private property owners. This bill allows Natives to fully exert their private property rights for subdivision and easement purposes,"" said Murkowski, of the measure that cleared the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee this spring. 
   ""This is a strange problem in that for years everyone assumed that Native landowners could subdivide their own property like all other private land owners. But only a few years ago that right came into question when it was pointed out that there is currently no statutory authorization that allows individual Alaskan Natives to subdivide their allotments, or to dedicate rights-of-way across those lands for public access,"" she said. 
   She noted that the problem arose in 2000 when a new owner questioned the authority of the Bristol Bay Borough in Alaska to place a utility line across a subdivided Native allotment. The new owner's concern brought to light the fact that there was no statute that allowed Native allotment owners to subdivide their lands, much less dedicate easements across them. 
   ""The lack of this explicit statutory authorization calls into question the validity of hundreds of parcels that already have been subdivided and lands that likely could be subdivided in the future. This bill solves that problem. The bill doesn't force Native land owners to do anything, but it may well help them to sell or dispose of their lands and gain the same value for their land that all other Alaskans enjoy,"" said Murkowski. 
   Under the measure previous subdivisions would be retroactively approved and Native land owners will be able to create new subdivisions if they so choose. 
   Murkowski noted that the legislation is supported by the federal government, by the State of Alaska, by local governments in Alaska and by Native groups. Murkowski noted that without the bill's passage, the titles to hundreds of parcels that have been subdivided and sold could be questioned in the future, as could the hundreds of utility easements and platted rights-of-way that have been placed across Native allotment tracts 
   She said she is very hopeful the House will approve the bill and send it to the President before the close of the 108th Congress this fall.

MURKOWSKI WINS APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION FOR REYNOLDS CREEK HYDRO PROJECT
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today also won unanimous Senate approval of legislation to extend the license of the proposed Reynolds Creek hydroelectric project on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast.  
 The legislation gives the Haida Corp., the sponsor of the project, up to six additional years to begin construction of the project. 
   Murkowski in March had introduced legislation approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee this spring to extend the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for the proposed 5-megawatt power project. FERC had issued a license two years ago for the 20-foot long, 6-foot high dam on Reynolds Creek - the project including a 3,200-foot penstock and a powerhouse and two turbine units and a transmission line to take power produced by the hydro project to Hydaburg - population 364. 
   Murkowski said the extension was needed to give more time for the island's economy - and electrical usage needs - to recover from the downturn caused by the reduction in logging efforts. The project will produce power that is less expensive and more environmentally friendly than the current diesel-generated power used on the island. 
   The bill (S. 2243) now heads to the House of Representatives for its approval.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today urged the United States to maintain and strengthen its relationship with Indonesia during a hearing of her Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  
   ""As Congressman Jim Leach noted a few years ago, there is no country in the world of such vital importance that is less understood than Indonesia,"" Murkowski said during the hearing to examine the American-Indonesian relationship. ""Shortly before our August break, I met with some members of the Australian Parliament and they urged me, and the U.S. as a whole, to pay more attention to Indonesia - and for good reason."" 
   Murkowski noted that Indonesia can be an increasingly important American partner on issues ranging from global energy supplies to the War on Terror. ""Indonesia is the home to the largest Muslim population of any nation and provides a moderating influence among Islamic states. If we want to improve our standing with the Muslim community outside of the United States, Indonesia is an appropriate starting point,"" Murkowski said. 
   Murkowski addressed the United States' continued cooperation with Indonesia in helping the country eradicate the avian influenza epidemic in the Southeast Asian region. Congress appropriated $25 million in the Iraq/Tsunami Supplemental Appropriations bill in May to help contain and prevent the spread of the bird flu. ""The impacts of the bird flu aren't limited to just the health of the people, but the health of the economy as well. In the past year, Indonesia's rate of inflation was 7.84 percent, in part because the destruction of chickens due to the avian influenza led to an increase in the price of eggs and poultry. Continued cooperation on this issue is a win for relations between our two countries and for the people of both nations,"" Murkowski said. 
   Also discussed at the hearing was Indonesia's continued policy of heavy domestic energy subsidization. The policy is having a substantial impact on Indonesia's economy - subsidies are expected to cost $13-$14 billion this year and are severely devaluing Indonesia's currency. ""In a world that is more and more dependent on global oil supplies, we need to be encouraging greater energy efficiencies, not just here at home, but overseas as well,"" Murkowski said. 
   Throughout the hearing, Sen. Murkowski expressed appreciation and gratitude to the people and the Government of Indonesia for their generous offers of assistance in the Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. ""This offer is even more impressive, given that Indonesia is itself still recovering from the devastating December tsunami,"" Murkowski said.

MURKOWSKI, STEVENS INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO STREAMLINE APPROVAL OF ALASKA GASLINE PROJECT
  Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens today introduced legislation to allow the Office of the Federal Pipeline Coordinator to quickly and efficiently begin its work. The bill allows for more flexibility in hiring personnel, allows the Federal Coordinator to establish reasonable filing and service fees, and clarifies the intent of the Natural Gas Pipeline Act regarding litigation. 
   In 2004, Congress provided tax credits and loan guarantees to improve chances for construction of an Alaska gas pipeline system. Additionally, Congress created the Office of Federal Pipeline Coordinator to oversee the 15 federal agencies that will have a role to play in construction and financing of a pipeline system. Congress also set up a streamlined permitting and expedited court review process to limit unnecessary delays in the project.  
   ""This legislation will make certain that the Federal government continues to be ready to work with potential contractors and the State of Alaska through the permitting process needed to construct a gasline,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""The project is too important for our nation's energy security and Alaska's economy to be delayed any further."" 
   ""Expediting the Alaska natural gas pipeline construction process is critically important to our State and nation,"" said Senator Stevens. ""In order to get Alaska's gas to market in time to compete with foreign LNG, we must ensure the federal review process is not overburdened or unnecessarily prolonged. A fully functioning office for our federal Pipeline Coordinator is essential to achieving this goal."" 
   Specifically, the legislation introduced today contains the following provisions: 
   1) Personnel Hiring: A provision that waives the pipeline coordinator from having to follow the time-consuming process of following executive branch hiring procedures for employees in the Federal Coordinator's Office. The provision should permit the office to be better staffed in six to nine months less than would be required under Title 5, thereby speeding permitting and design issues. 2) Fees and Charges for Permit Reviews: Section 1 (4) of the amendment allows the Federal Coordinator to establish reasonable filing and service fees, charges and commissions for review of pipeline plans submitted by the entity that wins the right to build the line. The fee structure is identical to what the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (Section 304) allows BLM to charge for similar reviews of permits and plans under oil and gas leases. The amendment allows the revenues to go to the Office of Federal Coordinator to pay for personnel needed to permit and oversee construction of a gas pipeline. 3) Clarification of Expedited Court Review Process: Section 2 of the bill clarifies the intent of the 2004 act that all suits related to the permitting or construction of a pipeline project must be filed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The original law required such filing for challenges related to the pipeline act. In order to remain consistent, this amendment requires that any challenges to the pipeline relating to the Administrative Procedures Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act also be filed in the same circuit. 
   The Alaska Legislature is currently considering Governor Palin's Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA). The legislation defines a competitive process by which the state will choose a gasline project, provides inducements for the construction of a gasline, and contains certain requirements that need to be met by any proposal.

   The 684-foot long amphibious transport dock ship (LPD 23) will carry a crew of approximately 360 Navy sailors and 700 Marines. It will be built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems at its Avondale Operations shipyard in New Orleans, La.
   ""Last October, the Navy decommissioned the old USS Anchorage (LSD-36), the oldest dock landing ship in the Navy, after she returned from service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

   ""It is only appropriate that the Navy name one of its newest amphibious transport dock ships (LPDs) after the City of Anchorage to follow her predecessor's record of accomplishment. It is a great honor to the citizens of the state's largest city to have one of the newest naval ships named in their honor,"" said Murkowski after being informed of the naming by the Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England.
   ""Anchorage has always been an important seaport and one of our Nation's great cities. For many years thousands of young men and women from Alaska have stepped forward to serve America as a Sailor or Marine. The warm hospitality of the people of Anchorage has always welcomed the Fleet. USS Anchorage will project American power to the far corners of the earth and support the cause of freedom well into the 21st century,"" said England.
   The ship is slated to have her keel laid in January 2006, to be christened in October 2007 and to be fully commissioned in April 2009. The ship will be used to transport and land Marines, as well as their equipment and supplies in support of amphibious assault, special operations and expeditionary warfare missions. These personnel and supplies will be delivered via embarked landing craft air cushions, conventional landing craft or amphibious vehicles and can be augmented by helicopters or vertical take-off and landing aircraft.
   The LPD 23 will play a vital role in the success of our Navy/Marine Corps team, said England. He said the ship will carry joint combat forces to the fight with increased lift capacity, superior command and control capabilities and improved ship survivability. It will give Expeditionary Strike Groups greater speed, agility and reach and will help the U.S. dominate the near land battlespace.
   The ship will include substantial quality of service improvements including sit-up berths, a ship services mall, an enhanced fitness center and a learning resource center. The ship, which will be built by Northrop Grumman Systems with Raytheon Systems Corp. and Intergraph Corp., will have a beam of 105 feet, displace approximately 24,900 tons at full load and have a speed in excess of 22 knots. It is powered by four sequentially turbocharged marine Colt-Pielstick Diesels, two shafts at 41,600 shaft horsepower.
   It will be able to launch or land two CH53E Super Stallion helicopters or up to four CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, Osprey tilt rotor aircraft, AH-1 or UH-1 helicopters. The ship will be equipped with two Bushmaster II 30 mm close in guns, fore and aft, and two Rolling Airframe Missile launchers fore and aft. It will be able to launch two LCACs (land craft/assault craft) and 14 Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicles.
   Murkowski thanked the Navy for so promptly moving to honor Alaska by the ship's naming coming only nine months after the decommissioning of the former vessel.

MURKOWSKI WELCOMES IRS SALES TAX EFFORTS
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed action by the IRS to issue a standard tax table to help many Alaskans take advantage of a tax change passed by Congress last fall, which allows residents who live in communities with local sales taxes, to deduct those taxes from their federal tax bills.  
   In the JOBS Act (Public Law 108-357) that Congress approved last fall there was a provision to permit residents who pay local sales taxes to deduct them from their federal taxes, just as Americans have been able to deduct state income taxes from their federal tax returns. When the IRS this winter issued their tax backup material for the 2004 return year, no deduction table was issued for Alaskans to use to compute the local sales tax deduction. IRS today rectified that by issuing Publication 600-A that applies specifically to Alaskans who have paid sales taxes at the local and borough level. 
   ""I am pleased that Alaskans can now more easily deduct local sales taxes from our federal returns. The change should help level the tax playing field and should benefit many Alaskans come April 15th,"" said Senator Murkowski. 
   While Anchorage residents pay no local sales taxes, residents in Juneau, for example, pay 5%, Kenai and Soldotna residents pay a combined 5% to their cities and boroughs and Ketchikan residents pay a combined rate of 6% in city and borough sales taxes. Under the new tax table, Alaskans who itemize will be able to claim a standard deduction based on their income and their number of exemptions. They can also claim a larger deduction if they have receipts for sales tax payments during the year, such as for cars or boats. 
   ""For Alaskans who have already filed their tax returns, it may be worthwhile for them to compute the tax savings if they live in a community with local sales taxes and file an amended,"" noted Murkowski. 
   While the tax savings will be dependent on a host of factors, a family of four that makes $50,000 and already itemizes, living in a community with a 5% sales tax, should receive a deduction of $1,015 - a deduction that would cut their taxes by between $150 and $200 depending on their actual tax bracket. 
   The form is now available to the public on the IRS internet site, at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p600a.pdf

MURKOWSKI URGES SENATE TO ADDRESS PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE CRISIS FACING THE NATION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today spoke on the floor of the Senate and urged her colleagues to address the physician shortage crisis facing the Nation. ""In just 20 years, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or older, a percentage larger than any other time in our nation's history,"" said Murkowski. ""And, just as this aging population places the highest demand on our health care system, the Council on Graduate Medical Education states that there will be a national shortage of over 100,000 physicians. Other experts predict a shortage closer to 200,000. If that becomes reality, 84 million patients will be left without a doctor's care."" 
   Earlier this year, Murkowski introduced the Rural Physician Relief Act, a bill that provides tax incentives for physicians to practice in, and serve residents of, the most rural areas of the nation. Today Murkowski indicated she will soon introduce the Physician Shortage Elimination Act - a bill designed to: 
   * Double the funding for the National Health Service Corps,  
   * Improve and expand medical residency programs, 
   * Reauthorize programs that provide incentives for disadvantaged and minority students to pursue health professions, and 
   * Bolster community health centers in rural communities. Murkowski also announced that that she will be chairing a Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee field hearing on February 20th in Anchorage. The purpose of the hearing is to investigate the shortage of primary care physicians throughout the nation, with a focus on rural communities. 
   ""The prognosis for quality of healthcare in America is poor,"" concluded Murkowski. ""50 million Americans in underserved areas across the nation already must do without care. The time for Congress to act is now."" The full remarks follow. 
   Physician Shortage Elimination Act Senator Lisa Murkowski Floor Statement February 14, 2007 In just 20 years, 20 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or older, a percentage larger than any other time in our nation's history. And, just as this aging population places the highest demand on our health care system, the Council on Graduate Medical Education states that there will be a national shortage of over 100,000 physicians. Other experts predict a shortage closer to 200,000. If that becomes reality, 84 million patients will be left without a doctor's care. A dozen states already report physician shortages. Across the country, patients are experiencing or soon will face shortages in many physician specialties, including cardiology, radiology and several pediatric and surgical subspecialties. 
   Demand for doctors is accelerating more rapidly than supply - yet the number of medical school graduates has remained virtually flat for a quarter century. During that same period, the median tuition and fees at medical schools have increased by 750% in private schools and by nearly 900% in public schools! To add to that, much of the nation's physician workforce also is graying and headed for the door. A third of the nation's 750,000 active, post-residency physicians are older than 55 and likely to retire just as the boomer generation moves into its time of greatest medical need. By 2020, physicians are expected to hang up their stethoscopes at a rate nearly two and half times the retirement rate today. Mr. President, a looming doctor shortage threatens to create a national healthcare crisis by further limiting access to physicians, jeopardizing quality and accelerating cost increases. People are waiting weeks for appointments and emergency departments have lines out the door. Many will go without care entirely. In rural America, patients have long gone without care. In fact, the shortage of physicians, especially primary care physicians, in rural areas of the U.S. represents one of the most intractable health policy problems of the past century. As a result, rural patients are often denied both access to care and quality of care. 
   Mr. President, one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural America, yet only 9% of the nation's physicians are practicing in these areas. Over 50 million of these rural Americans live in areas that have a shortage of physicians to meet their basic needs. Additionally, physician recruitment to rural America has also long been a problem. The high cost of medical school is in large part to blame - most students, severely in debt after medical school, are forced away from primary care and into more lucrative specialty medicine. Rural areas and their community health centers across the nation report a declining ability to recruit primary care physicians. In Alaska - a state larger than Texas, California and Montana combined - rural brings on a new meaning. The physician shortage crisis in Alaska has long been magnified. Health care delivery in the state is extremely difficult because, in part, there are fewer roads than any other state. (Even Rhode Island has more.) This means that for the vast majority of communities in Alaska, all medical supplies, patients and providers must travel by air. Alaska's population is growing, especially its elderly population, which is the second fastest growing in the nation. However, Alaska's physician workforce, like others across the nation, is aging. The number of new residents is not keeping up with attrition. 118 physicians in Anchorage alone are expected to retire in the next ten years. 
   Currently, Alaska has the sixth lowest ratio of physicians to population of the United States. Outside of Anchorage, the ratio is the worst in the nation. To reach the national average by 2025, Alaska needs a net increase of 980 physicians statewide, or 49 more physicians per year. 
   In Anchorage, many specialties are in serious or critical shortage, including general internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, rheumatology, and infectious diseases. Patients wait for months to be accepted as new patients for general internal medicine, and others have to be flown to Seattle for some critical specialties. 
   However, there is a bright spot. Even though, Alaska has only one residency training program that trains 12 family medicine residents each year - far fewer than our population needs. 
   Mr. President, in the last Congress, with great fanfare, we provided a Medicare prescription drug benefit. But what good is that benefit if there are no physicians to write a prescription? In the 21st Century, we cannot, as a government, permit such dire access to care to continue. 
   I believe this situation is intolerable. This body cannot idly sit by while potentially millions of patients go with care. That is why I am proposing a three-pronged plan to alleviate the nation's rural health care access crisis. Earlier in the year, I introduced the Rural Physician Relief Act, a bill that provides tax incentives for physicians to practice in our most rural and frontier locations in the country. 
   Today, I am announcing a second step on improving access to health care. Soon I will introduce the Physician Shortage Elimination Act, a strong step in improving access to our health system. Later, as the third prong to my plan, I will introduce comprehensive legislation for improving the plight of the uninsured. 
   The Physician Shortage Elimination Act does four things: 
   * First and foremost, my legislation doubles the funding for the National Health Service Corps. This program has operated with 37 years of excellence - providing primary care services to our most vulnerable populations. It's a solution to the many students who find the exorbitant cost of medical school prohibitively expensive. However, the program is just too small to meet the great need in underserved America. Right now, over 4,000 National Health Service Corps (NHSC) clinicians provide primary care to nearly 6 million people nationwide - who otherwise would likely have gone without care. Tragically, this still leaves some 50 million people with extremely diminished access to health care. In fact, the American Association of Medical Colleges said the current program only meets 12% of the need of the underserved. However, the program is so popular with medical students, that 80% of its applicants in a typical year must be turned away. Mr. President, the National Health Service Corps has a proven track record. Why not build on its success? Doubling our investment in the National Health Service Corps is the most prudent, cost effective and expeditious way to meet the current needs and future needs of America's underserved. In fact, the former president of the AAMC stated that the National Health Service Core ""is ideally positioned to alleviate the shortage of physicians in many medically underserved areas but has only had sufficient funding to accommodate only a fraction of those young physicians who are prepared to practice in those areas."" * The second part of my bill will improve and expand current medical residency programs. Mr. President, half of all physicians practice medicine within 100 miles of their residency. This means that residents who train in rural or underserved areas are likely to remain in those areas. The small Alaska Family Residency Program, a program designed to help meet the needs in rural Alaska, is a shining example of this. Out of the 55 graduates, 77% have stayed in Alaska upon completing their residency - the highest rate of return of any graduate medical program in the country! Unfortunately, the Alaska Family Residency is too small to meet the large needs of rural Alaska. 
   Mr. President, rural and underserved residency programs must be allowed to flourish. Arcane barriers and artificial caps on residency programs must be removed - students must be allowed to learn their craft in the most rural and underserved areas of the nation. My legislation will prevent residency programs from being penalized for training in locations where the need is greatest - such as Indian Health Service locations. Additionally, it will remove barriers that prevent programs from developing rural training rotations and rural experiences in their curriculum. Experts agree that this is the most effective way to prepare students for a rural practice. 
   * Further, my legislation will reauthorize the Center of Excellence program and the Health Careers Opportunity Program, which did not receive funding for 2006. These important programs target disadvantaged and minority students from as young as kindergarten (on through high school) - to develop an interest in health professions. The programs nurture the youth in rural and underserved areas and create a ""pipeline"" to careers in the health professions. This concept of ""growing your own"" is the most effective way of achieving long-term retention in the most rural locations. 
   * Lastly, my legislation will bolster the cornerstone of health care in rural America - the community health center. Community health centers provide quality, community-based health care for millions of America's medically underserved and uninsured. My bill will help them do their job. Specifically, it will expand residency programs and primary care services offered by Community Health Centers and offer grants to health centers to assist them in recruitment, technical assistance and physician mentoring programs. Mr. President, a strong commitment to our community health centers is a smart, cost-effective way of maximizing our health care dollars for our neediest populations. 
   Finally, I am pleased to announce that the Senate HELP Committee, of which I am a new member, has agree to conduct a field hearing on the physician shortage crisis in rural America. Next week, the HELP Committee will hear from patients, providers and health care experts in Anchorage, Alaska on how the crisis is crippling health care in my state and in other rural areas across the nation. The Committee will hear compelling testimony of patients who cannot find a physician and testimony from the medical experts on the front lines as to how Congress can help resolve this crisis. I thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi for making this important hearing happen. 
   Mr. President, the prognosis for quality of healthcare in America is poor. 50 million Americans in underserved areas across the nation already must do without care. Soon, even greater physician shortages will mean that another 84 million patients will be left without a physician's care. The time for Congress to act is now. I ask my colleagues to support the Physician Shortage Elimination Act. 
   Thank you.

  Senators Murkowski and Stevens and Congressman Young today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will release $3,558,253 to Alaska for the Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This nationwide program is designed to help low-income families and senior citizens pay home energy costs.  
   ""The cost of energy is having a detrimental impact across the state, particularly in rural areas,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""This increase to LIHEAP will help the state provide assistance to more Alaskans during the critical winter months; however, I recognize we must find a more secure, long-term solution to this problem. I will continue to promote increasing energy supplies throughout the state through traditional and renewable sources."" 
   ""Alaskans continue to pay some of the highest energy costs in the nation and no one feels the impacts more than our state's low-income families,"" said Senator Stevens. ""These LIHEAP funds provide needed short-term relief. Our state has enormous domestic energy potential. We need to find new and innovative ways to develop both renewable and fossil fuel energy resources and we will continue to work with the Administration to address the cost of energy in Alaska."" 
   ""I am very pleased to see Alaska getting the kind of assistance it unfortunately needs,"" said Representative Young. ""In a place where heating oil is now $6 a gallon and temperatures are regularly below zero, too many Alaskans are going without proper heat this winter because they cannot afford it. It would be nice to see the LIHEAP money apportioned more equally but I'd take assistance from Americans over Hugo Chavez any day. My hope is that one day we will finally tap into our God given resources and make our prosperous country energy independent. But until then, I appreciate the federal aid to those Alaskans that need it most, this cold winter."" 
   As the prices of natural gas, heating oil, propane, and electricity continue to rise, home energy costs are increasingly unaffordable for millions of Americans, especially those living in rural areas. LIHEAP provides a vital safety net for low-income households, disabled individuals, and senior citizens in Alaska and throughout the nation. The program also helps low-income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy expenses. Senators Stevens and Murkowski have been staunch supporters of increasing funds available for the LIHEAP program. 
   In Alaska, LIHEAP is administered through the State Department of Health and Social Services. Additional information can be found by calling 1-888-804-6330 or visiting www.hss.state.ak.us/dpa/programs/hap/.

  Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Jim Talent, R-Mo., and Rep.

Sens. Talent and Murkowski successfully offered the legislation in the Senate as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill (S. 2400) on June 3.  
   ""Our legislation will allow the families of wounded service personnel to visit their loved one in a military hospital at no personal expense for the airfare,"" said Sen. Talent. ""It will also permit soldiers who must return home from overseas while on emergency leave to do so at no cost by using donated frequent flyer miles. A service member who has to return home would face real financial hardship if they had to purchase commercial airfare on a moment's notice. This legislation will allow Americans to directly support and assist our service men and women and their families by donating frequent flyer miles."" 
   ""The amendment will justly allow the families of wounded service personnel to visit their loved ones in a military hospital at no personal expense for airfare. It also will permit soldiers who must return home from overseas to do so at no cost by utilizing the air miles donated by Americans. This program allows Americans to show in a tangible way their support for our troops and it will help the military avoid the very real financial hardship caused when they need to purchase commercial airfares on short notice. It is the least we can do for our troops who are protecting us overseas,"" said Sen. Murkowski. 
   ""Our men and women in uniform are risking their lives for our country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in other locations around the world. Their service is to be commended.

We believe this legislation will make a big difference in the lives of our military families in the years come,"" said Congressman Ruppersberger (D-MD). 
   The legislation makes Operation Hero Miles a permanent Department of Defense (DOD) program, giving DOD the authority to accept the donation of frequent traveler miles, credits and tickets by the general public in order to give free, last minute plane tickets to servicemen and women on leave to handle an urgent family situation, convalescent leave or other unexpected emergencies. 
   The legislation also gives DOD the authority to give free plane tickets to family members of wounded troops traveling to visit their injured loved ones at military hospitals around the world. Under special circumstances, the DOD is also authorized to allow a non-family member, such as clergy or a close mentor, use of the donated miles to reunite with a wounded or ill servicemember. The Department is to designate a single office to administer the Operation Hero Miles program, to establish rules and procedures for eligibility and disbursement of miles and to promote participation in the program and donation of miles by airlines, organizations and the public.

MURKOWSKI COMMENTS ON SENATE HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski made the following comments on the need to pass the highway reauthorization bill, H.R. 3. The bill contains several items for Alaska such as funding to build roads in rural Alaska, elevated funding for the Alaska Marine Highway System, remedies to unfair airplane usage fees and flight seeing excise taxes, and grants to states for motorcycle safety programs. 
   Senator Murkowski: ""I think I speak for all my constituents when I urge this body to move forward on the highway bill. Every State needs it, but truly I believe none need it more than my State of Alaska.  
   ""For most of us traveling from one place to another, it means asking yourself whether you walk, drive, take a bus, take a train, or an airplane. That is life in the 21st century. But in much of Alaska, Americans are still facing issues that are similar to what we faced in the 19th century. In much of Alaska, whether you drive is not a question without meaning. Instead, the question is, what time of year is it? Is it the time of year I will be using a snowmobile or going by boat? 
   ""...The highway bill and the highway trust fund which supports it exist for one reason: because Congress recognized that reliable transportation is critical to our national well-being and to the well-being of our individual citizens. This is no less true in the farthest, most remote parts of Alaska than it is in the center of Manhattan. That is why this bill contains provisions to allow the Denali Commission to construct roads between remote communities in Alaska. 
   ""This provision is based on a bill I had proposed in 2003 which would streamline the process of bringing Alaska's transportation system into the modern age. The same provision, as amended by the Senate action last year, will also help improve roads within Alaska's many Native villages, some of which still have only the roughest of trails from one part of town to another. 
   ""Frankly, the authorization in the bill for this purpose is simply not enough because Alaska has so many years of neglect to catch up on. I am sensitive, however, to the fiscal realities, and I am deeply grateful for the support of those who have helped us get this far. We must recognize this is not just an investment in Alaska today, but it is an investment in Alaska's tomorrow. 
   ""For the record, I would also prefer to have a separate system and significantly more money dedicated to our Native village transportation needs. They have been badly neglected. In fact, they have been shamefully neglected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs reservation roads system which is supposed to provide funding for Native American needs. Alaska Native villages have been ignored, their road miles have been uncounted, and money has been funneled into other areas that already have sophisticated road systems. 
   ""...In much of Alaska it is literally impossible to build roads between some communities, even in long-settled areas like in southeastern Alaska where I was born, where a combination of rugged terrain and the separation of the islands have made other solutions necessary. One solution for the area in the southeast was the establishment of the Alaska Marine Highway System, which builds on a core fleet of large oceangoing vessels in service as ferries. It is the only highway possible between communities such as Ketchikan, Petersburg, Wrangell, Sitka, Juneau, our State capital, and many other smaller communities. It is part of the National Highway System. 
   ""If the definition of a highway is a facility used by trucks and cars moving from one community to another, this is, indeed, a highway. In fact, it is one that is considerably less expensive than other options such as tunneling, like we have up in Boston, the 'Big Dig,' or the combination of bridges and tunnels we see around here. 
   ""The last highway bill, contained provisions to fund ferries and ferry terminals in addition to funding received through the National Highway System. I am pleased to say that this bill does as well. In fact, ferry system assistance in this bill is even broader and will help even more States operating ferry systems to do a better job for their citizens. 
   ""...The finance portion of the bill includes provisions based on two bills which I have previously offered. One of these provisions corrects an inequity imposed on air passengers who live in rural areas where, again, they are unconnected by road and they are forced when they are traveling to fly to a larger airport where they can catch a plane to get somewhere, to reach their final destination. All passengers currently pay a segment fee for air travel, but these rural residents I am talking about are basically forced to pay twice, while passengers who live within driving distance of a larger airport only pay once. 
   ""The second measure which I just referenced affects seaplane operators who are not using FAA facilities but currently must pay excise taxes and fees intended solely to support such facilities. This is also an inequity, and my measure will ensure that only those receiving benefits are asked to pay for them. 
   ""In addition, it is my understanding that the committee has also included a measure intended to ensure that taxes and fees intended for aircraft carrying passengers from point to point is not incorrectly applied to flight-seeing operations. Senator Inouye has taken the lead on this matter, but it is worth noting that it has significant support among my constituents in Alaska, and I am pleased to see it included. 
   ""Finally, let me note that I understand that the Commerce Committee title includes my proposal to establish State grants for motorcycle rider education. As my colleagues may be aware, motorcycle ridership is increasing all the time, and with it the number of motorcycle accidents has also been rising, particularly among the new riders. It is not necessarily the young riders but riders of any age. It is the latter that my proposal addresses. I believe firmly that the best way to prevent injuries is to prevent accidents, and training is the only way to accomplish that goal. 
   ""I have worked closely with the Motorcycle Riders Foundation and State motorcycle education administrators to develop this proposal. All too often, we will see new riders, both young and old, simply climb on and hope that they are going to learn by experience. Better training has been shown to drastically reduce the number of accidents suffered by new riders during the critical period in which their learning curve is the steepest and they are most at risk. 
   ""From the national perspective, this highway bill is a good bill. It is not perfect, but few things are. I would prefer to see more streamlining and permitting processes for highway projects. I would like to see more flexibility for States. I would like to see a bill with the funding level that we approved last year.

MURKOWSKI HELPS KICK OFF AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION'S CONGRESSIONAL HEART AND STROKE LOBBY DAY
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined representatives from the American Heart Association to help kick off their Congressional Heart and Stroke Lobby Day. Hundreds of volunteers, as well as heart disease and stroke survivors, plan to meet with their elected officials in Congress to ask them to support legislative efforts to combat cardiovascular disease. Sen. Murkowski is an original sponsor of the HEART for Women Act - a bipartisan initiative aimed at improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of heart disease and stroke in women.  
   ""We must enable our women, our families and our health care providers to confront cardiovascular disease,"" said Senator Murkowski at the kickoff event. ""Heart disease does not have to be the nation's leading cause of death and I will continue to fight this fight with you. I am proud to do what I can in the U.S. Senate to battle cardiovascular diseases, and will be working with my colleagues to gain support for heart-friendly legislation."" 
   One in three adult women suffers from some form of cardiovascular disease, and heart disease kills more women than the next five causes of death combined. In Alaska, nearly 27 percent of all deaths in women are due to cardiovascular disease. It is not necessarily an older person's disease: 35 percent of all heart disease deaths in Alaska occur among people under the age of 65. The Heart for Women Act takes a three-pronged approach to reducing the cardiovascular disease death rate for women, through improved health education, gender specific analysis and research, and increased access to screening for women. The bill would expand the WISEWOMAN program to all 50 states, providing free screening for heart disease and stroke for low-income women. Today, only 14 states have WISEWOMAN programs, including two programs in Alaska.

MURKOWSKI SAYS PATRIOT ACT CONFERENCE REPORT UNACCEPTABLE
  Today, Sen. Lisa Murkowski said that she would not accept the draft Patriot Act reauthorization conference report that was recently made public.  
   Murkowski joined with the other original co-sponsors of the SAFE Act, previous legislation that would have modified provisions of the Patriot Act to reflect concerns over civil liberties issues, in a letter sent today to the Patriot Act reauthorization conferees signaling concerns with the current draft legislation. 
   ""The Senate version of the Patriot Act reauthorization passed this summer was an extraordinary example of bipartisan efforts,"" Murkowski said. ""The compromise reached in the Senate contained common sense provisions that achieved the balance between law enforcement flexibility and protection of civil liberties. The draft report issued today retreats from that compromise and is unacceptable."" 
   The letter sent by Senators Murkowski, Craig (R-ID), Sununu (R-NH), Durbin (D-IL), Feingold (D-WI) and Salazar (D-CO) states: 
   ""As the original cosponsors of the SAFE Act, we are deeply concerned about the draft Patriot Act reauthorization conference report made available to us early this afternoon. The Senate version of the bill, passed by unanimous consent in July, was itself a compromise that resulted from intense negotiations by Senators from all sides of the partisan and ideological divides. Unfortunately, the conference committee draft retreats significantly from the bipartisan consensus we reached in the Senate. It simply does not accomplish what we and many of our colleagues in the Senate believe is necessary - a reauthorization bill that continues to provide law enforcement with the tools to investigate possible terrorist activity while making reasonable changes to the original law to protect innocent people from unnecessary and intrusive government surveillance."" 
   ""To support this bill, we need to see significant movement back toward the Senate position in the following areas: (1) Section 215 (library and other sensitive business records); (2) Section 505 (National Security Letters); (3) sunset provisions; and (4) Section 213 (sneak and peek). We will communicate with the conferees this afternoon and provide specific suggestions to improve the bill in these four important areas."" ""For the past several years, our bipartisan coalition has been working together to highlight and fix the civil liberties problems posed by the Patriot Act. We introduced the SAFE Act to address those problems, while still maintaining important law enforcement powers needed to combat terrorism. We have worked too long and too hard to allow this conference report to eliminate the modest protections for civil liberties that were agreed to unanimously in the Senate."" 
   ""The conference report, in its current form, is unacceptable. There is still time for the conference committee to step back and agree to the Senate's bipartisan approach. If the conference committee doesn't do that, we will fight to stop this bill from becoming law.""

MURKOWSKI ANNOUNCES MAJOR GRANT TO TEST ALTERNATIVE ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM OIL PRODUCTION
  Senator Lisa Murkowski today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has awarded a major grant to Chena Power, a subsidiary of Chena Hot Springs Resort located outside of Fairbanks, to prove the feasibility of generating alternative electricity from the hot water separated from fossil fuels during production at oil and gas wells. 
   The grant could have major implications for geothermal energy development nationwide since there are thousands of working oil and gas wells in America in a dozen states that generate enough geothermal water to possibly produce 5,000 megawatts of clean, renewable energy to add to the nation's electricity portfolio.  
   ""This is an important project for Alaska since Alaska's oil fields on the North Slope and Cook Inlet produce more than 1.2 million barrels of water each day. This is water that is often below the boiling point, but often hot enough utilizing the new technology being pioneered at Chena Hot Springs to produce geothermal electricity. Using the water that today is just a waste product of oil and gas production can save energy in fossil fuel production and could add clean electricity to our nation's power grid. It is an important project for the nation and the state,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski who has been seeking a variety of grant aid from the federal government to advance geothermal development. 
   The grant builds on the success of Chena Hot Springs and its owner Bernie Karl who in 2005 won federal aid to tap the resort's lower-temperature geothermal resources to produce power. Using a new binary organic rankine cycle power plant (turbine) created by United Technologies Corp., the Chena resort has been producing all of its electricity needs from roughly 160-degree water (F) for the past year. 
   The $724,000 federal grant, being matched by equal funds from Chena Power, United Technology and by assistance from BP Alaska, will fund a $1.45 million effort to modify the low-temperature geothermal turbine system developed at Chena to work on the water separated from oil from wells at the Prudhoe Bay oil field. The power generated from the demonstration project will be utilized to power the oil field, replacing a small portion of the 162 megawatts of electricity now generated by the field's natural gas-fired turbines. 
   Senator Murkowski is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is a co-sponsor of legislation to fund a new national geothermal energy initiative. She added, ""This is an exciting project since there are thousands of oil wells in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Wyoming, Montana, even Arkansas, areas that don't possess other traditional geothermal heat sources, but that do have water that flows from oil wells at high enough temperatures to produce electricity. In many cases up to 95% of the fluid that flows from an oil well is water, not oil, and all of it is available to produce geothermal power using this new technology. DOE should be commended for funding this important research."" 
   The grant award was confirmed by Alexander Karsner, the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy. The Prudhoe Bay project is just one of a number of good candidates for geothermal energy development. Other projects range from the Mt. Spurr area near Anchorage to Naknek to power the Bristol Bay region, to proposed projects at Akutan and Unalaska in the Aleutians and Pilgrim Hot Springs in Northwest Alaska to ones at Tenakee and Bell Island in Southeast.

MURKOWSKI CO-SPONSORS ?SAFE' DRUG IMPORTATION BILL
  In an effort to speed the ability of Americans to import safe prescription drugs from Canada and some other European Union nations, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski has co-sponsored legislation to permit drug importation, which controls the safety of the drugs imported, especially from foreign internet pharmacies.  
   Murkowski this week joined fellow Sen. Judd Gregg, R- N.H., chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, in proposing legislation to allow Americans to import prescription drugs (S. 2493) from Canada and traditional European Union nations, provided the drugs are protected by basic safety standards to prevent the counterfitting of drugs or loss of quality control on the medicines. 
   ""I am keenly aware that many Alaskans kind it difficult to afford the rising price of prescription drugs and I certainly support efforts to make prescription drugs more affordable and readily available. My concern all along is that drug importation is done in a way to protect the safety of the medicines and the health of Americans taking the drugs. This bill should solve the safety concerns and guarantee that Americans won't be harmed by the medicines that are designed to help them,"" said Murkowski. 
   The Gregg bill, unlike a Democratic alternative proposed by Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., will require that imported drugs to this country from Canada are: 
   * U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs, manufactured in FDA approved facilities. 
  * Drugs from importers and exporters who are registered with the FDA.
  * Individually labeled as imported drugs. 
  * Drugs, if purchased over the internet, that are from internet pharmacies that are licensed and strictly regulated. 
  * Drugs that are not controlled substances.
  * And drugs that do not require refrigeration or are light sensitive. 
   Murkowski for months has said she supports the concept of allowing the importation of drugs from Canada in an attempt to add competitive pressures to reduce American drug prices. But she said she would only support such importation measures when safety concerns were met. 
   She took that position because during May Senate testimony from the FDA, the agency reported that ""import blitzes"" conducted last summer at four international drug mail facilities discovered that 88 percent of the mail-order products were unapproved or otherwise illegal. The problems included drugs that were never approved by the FDA, drugs with illegal labeling, drugs that were withdrawn from the market, or drugs that were controlled substances. 
   The Gregg bill solves the problem, in part, by setting up a statutory and regulatory structure to police internet pharmacies. The pharmacies will have to provide specific professional services including providing confidential patient medication profiles, use licensed pharmacists as consultants and require the verification of prescription validity. The bill also requires documentation of an uninterrupted chain of custody from the original drug manufacturer to the foreign seller to prevent the introduction of counterfit or out-of-date drugs and it also beefs up safety standards to prevent the sale of no longer effective drugs to Americans. 
   ""The few Alaskans who drive across the border to fill prescriptions know that Canada does an excellent job of inspecting drugs intended to be sold to Canadians. Canada, however, takes no responsibility for drugs shipped outside of its borders. This bill guarantees that the U.S. FDA will have the ability to protect American consumers, but it does not set up such onerous, costly regulations that would defeat the entire purpose of drug importation. This bill will protect the American public, while helping to curb rising drug prices,"" said Murkowski of her support for the measure. 
   She said teamed with the new Medicare prescription drug benefit that she helped pioneer last year - including the drug card program already in effect - that Congress is certainly working to reduce prescription drug costs for Americans.

  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed action by the Senate Appropriations Committee that has agreed to include funding for several projects that the Senator proposed to the committee in its version of the Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations spending bill for FY '05.  
   The committee, chaired by fellow Alaskan Sen. Ted Stevens, Wednesday morning ""marked up"" and approved its version of the Commerce, Justice and State spending bill, clearing the way for Senate consideration of the measure. 
   Concerning the Department of Justice budget, the Senator won $1.75 million for infrastructure for the Land Mobile Radio system to improve public safety communication in Anchorage. She also won another $1.75 million for purchase of similar radio equipment for the Kenai Peninsula Borough. 
   The senator, in a joint effort with Sen. Stevens, also won $2.5 million for construction of a statewide Land Mobile Radio network, a network important to further homeland security in Alaska. Working with Sen. Stevens, she also won $2 million for a training program for the state's Village Public Safety Officers program, including money for acquisition of emergency response and search and rescue equipment for rural communities. 
   The Senator also sought and won $1.45 million for Wasilla so that mobile computers can be installed in Wasilla city policy squad cars, the money also funding a computer link to the town's police station. She also gained $225,000 to fund enhanced crime scene examinations by the State and $200,000 for a South Central Alaska Search and Rescue Training project to be developed by the Anchorage Police Department. 
   The Senator also worked with Sen. Stevens to gain $1.1 million from the Bureau of Justice Assistance Discretionary Grant program for a program to help alcohol interdiction efforts, including efforts to investigate and prosecute bootlegging crimes as part of a statewide effort to reduce Fetal Alcohol Syndrome problems in Alaska. The money is intended to go to the Alaska State Troopers and to the Alaska Department of Law and is important since 80 percent of all crime in the state is committed by those under the influence of alcohol. 
   The Senator, jointly with Sen. Stevens, sought and won approval for $950,000 for a domestic violence prosecution unit to enforce zero tolerance policies against domestic violence. 
   The Senator also won $750,000 to fund the Sexual Assault Response Team of the Municipality of Anchorage. She won $2.7 million in funding for a sexual assault, domestic violence prosecution unit for the State of Alaska. She won $2.4 million for funding for an Anchorage Domestic Violence Prevention Project and $750,000 for a Victims of Justice program designed to help victims of violent crime. 
   Murkowski sought much of the funding as an outgrowth of a Domestic Violence Summit that she sponsored in Anchorage this summer, which indicated the need for more effort to combat domestic violence in Alaska. 
   The Senator sought and won $1 million to fund an expansion of Youth Courts in Alaska. The courts offer alternative adjudication and sentencing procedures for first-time youth offenders who are offered mentoring and family counseling services. And she sought and won $602,000 for a child support enforcement effort in the state. 
   She sought $2.5 million for a new Alaska Court System Information Network, funding for the state's court system to develop a computer network to allow remote access to court records. 
   Economic Development Administration: 
   The Senator, jointly with Sen. Stevens, sought and won $4 million in additional funding for economic development grants - money to fund development efforts to diversify local economies. The funding should contribute to fulfilling a commitment that was made to the state in 2000 that Alaska would receive about $15 million in aid for several years to help offset downturns in the state's fishing economy. 
   Small Business Administration: 
   * She sought and won $1.58 million for the Small Business Administration to fund the Technology Venture Center/Tech Ranch in Montana and the InvestNet Partnership program in Alaska. The money, for salaries and expenses, should help these organizations develop innovative programs to promote economic alliances between Alaska and Montana entrepreneurs and investors. The money will be split between the Alaska and Montana programs. 
   * She sought and won $150,000 for the Alaska Procurement Technical Assistance Center. 
   * $1 million to establish a National Database of Minority Businesses. 
   * $1.2 million for construction of a small business development center in Wrangell to assist the town's economic diversification efforts. 
   NOAA: 
   * She sought and won $2.5 million to fund the Alaska Ocean Observing system. The system's mission is to improve the ability to rapidly detect changes in marine ecosystems and living resources and to predict future changes. When finished, the network will deliver both real-time information and long-term trends about Alaska's ocean conditions and marine life. 
   * She sought and won $2 million for the International Arctic Research Center to improve Arctic climate research. 
   * She sought and won $1.5 million to fund a cleanup of trash and marine debris along coastal Alaska. 
   * She sought and won $1 million for new rockfish research in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The basic biological research is designed to prevent a depletion of stocks that could then affect other stock harvests. 
   * She sought some $8.1 million to fully fund implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty next year. Murkowski earlier this year had convinced the U.S. State Department to transfer money to fund salmon treaty habitat efforts following a funding shortfall. This funding level should guarantee full funding for the administrative duties of the commission. 
   * She won $3 million for acquisition of enhanced fishery habitat equipment and the launches to hold the equipment, to be based on the Fairweather research vessel headquartered in Ketchikan. The boats will conduct a variety of fisheries research in state waters. 
   * She also won $4.9 million to fund the costs of moving the research vessel Oscar Dyson to Kodiak. 
   * She sought and won $3,368,000 to fund fish hatchery facilities in Fairbanks using waste heated water from facilities in town. The hatchery should produce more fish on the Chena and Tanana Rivers for Interior fishermen. 
   * And she sought and won $3.5 million for efforts to restore salmon fisheries in her hometown of Anchorage at Ship, Chester and Campbell Creeks including habitat restoration efforts and related facilities.

MURKOWSKI COSPONSORS ENERGY EFFICIENCY LEGISLATION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues to introduce major energy efficiency legislation that should save the nation 50 billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, conserve enough natural gas to heat a quarter million homes a year, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
   The Energy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007 provides federal aid to pioneer advanced lighting technologies, expedites new efficiency standards for household appliances, provides grants to automakers to retool facilities to produce advanced technology ""plug-in"" hybrid vehicles, and funds research on advanced battery technology. The latter provision is similar to one Murkowski proposed earlier this year in the REFRESH Act, (S. 298) which provides $100 million for battery research. 
   ""Increasing energy efficiency is an important aspect of a balanced approach to improving the nation's energy future,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""These efficiency measures go hand-in-hand with increasing energy from renewable and alternative sources as well as traditional fuels. We must do everything we can to cut our dependence on foreign energy sources."" 
   The bill also requires the federal government to purchase vehicles that will be 30 percent more efficient by 2016, requires the government to buy enough renewable energy so 15 percent of federal facilities are powered by renewable energy by 2015, requires the government to make federal buildings use 30 percent less energy by 2015, and reauthorizes the weatherization and state energy grant programs among a host of other provisions. 
   Murkowski authored a provision that would provide grants and tax assistance to companies that build energy efficiency appliances and mechanical systems for buildings in cold climates, and makes such appliances eligible for ""Energy Star"" tax deductions when purchased by home and building owners. That provision is intended to spur development of more energy efficient combination heat and power units, one of the leading ways that cold-climate structures can save energy, according to Alaska energy officials. 
   ""The Alaska-provision is intended to provide incentives to encourage the development of appliances and furnaces that run on both renewable energy and fossil fuels. The hybrid devices offer real promise at reducing fuel costs in Alaska homes and buildings,"" said Murkowski. 
   Murkowski joined with Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Bryon Dorgan, D-N.D., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., in sponsoring the bipartisan bill that likely will become part of a new Senate energy package of bills in coming weeks. The bill when fully implemented, besides saving 50 billion kilowatt hours a year also will save the nation 560 million gallons of water a day - about 1.3 percent of daily potable water usage.

2006 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today gave the following address about the deplorable leadership and oppression exercised by Burma s dictatorship following the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi   Mr  President  every so often a clarifying moment in international affairs reminds us of the stakes involved in a particular conflict  and of our moral obligation to stand with those who risk their lives for the principles of freedom  The violent crackdown against Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters over the weekend underscores the brutal and unreconstructed character of Burma s dictatorship  The assault should remind democrats everywhere that we must actively support her struggle to deliver the human rights and freedom of a people long denied them by an oppressive military regime   The arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi following a coordinated  armed attack against her and her supporters is a reminder to the world that Burma s military junta has neither legitimacy nor limits on its power to crush peaceful dissent  The junta insists it stepped in to restore order following armed clashes between members of Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy and unnamed opponents  In fact  the regime s forces had been harassing Suu Kyi and the NLD for months  The junta s Union Solidarity Development Association orchestrated and staged last weekend s attack  killing at least 70 of her supporters and injuring Suu Kyi herself  perhaps seriously  Credible reports suggest that the regime s thugs targeted Suu Kyi personally  She is now being held incommunicado by Burmese military intelligence  her party offices have been closed  many of its activists are missing  and universities have been shut down  After having spent most of the last 14 years under house arrest  Ms  Suu Kyi is  one again  a political prisoner   Aung San Suu Kyi is one of the world s most courageous champions of freedom  I join advocates of a free Burma everywhere in expressing outrage at her unwarranted detention and call for her immediate  unconditional release  and the freedom to travel and speak throughout her country   Closing party offices  shuttering universities  and detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party in the name of protecting her demonstrate how estranged the junta is from its own people  and how potent are Suu Kyi s appeals for democratic change in a nation that resoundingly endorsed her in democratic elections 13 years ago  The junta s decision to release her from house arrest a year ago  and to permit her to speak and travel within tightly circumscribed limits  appeared to reflect the generals  calculation that her popular appeal had diminished  and that perhaps her fighting spirit had flagged  They could not have been more wrong   Aung San Suu Kyi remains the legitimately elected and overwhelmingly popular leader of her country  Even though she was under house arrest in 1990  her party captured 82 percent of the vote  shocking the generals  Neither the huge majority of the Burmese people who voted for the NLD nor the international community have forgotten how Burma s junta rejected the election results  nor how the regime s forces massacred its own people at a democratic rally two years earlier  We have not forgotten the many political prisoners who remain in Burma s jails  or the repression Burma s people have endured for decades  The assault on Burma s free political future at the hands of the regime last weekend has reminded us of what we already knew  the junta cannot oversee the reform and opening of Burma  for it remains the biggest obstacle to the freedom and prosperity of the Burmese people  Burma cannot change as long as the junta rules  without restraint or remorse   Despite these obvious truths  of which we have been reminded again this week  some countries have chosen to pursue policies of political and commercial engagement with the government in Rangoon on the grounds that working with and through the junta would have a more significant liberalizing effect than isolating and sanctioning it  ASEAN admitted Burma in 1997  Beijing has enjoyed warm relations with Rangoon  and most countries trade with it  only the United States and Europe impose mild sanctions against the regime  Proponents of engagement pointed to the nascent dialogue between Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime  and her release from house arrest last May  as indicators that perhaps external influence was having some beneficial effect on the dictatorship  But advocates of engagement have little to show for it following last weekend s assault on the democrats   Burma s junta must understand quite clearly that it will not enjoy business as usual following its brutal attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD  It is time for the international community to acknowledge that the status quo serves nobody s interests except those of the regime  Burma s people suffer  its neighbors are embarrassed  companies cannot do the kind of business they would with a free and developing Burma  the drug lords flourish in a vacuum of governance  and the situation inside the country grows more unstable as the regime s misrule increasingly radicalizes and impoverishes its people   No country or leader motivated by the welfare of the Burmese people  a desire for regional stability and prosperity  or concern for Burma s place among nations can maintain that rule by the junta serves these interests  I find it hard to believe that any democratic government would stand by the junta as it takes Burma on a forced march back in time  Yet this morning  when asked about the weekend s assault  the Japanese Foreign Minister denied that the situation in Burma was getting worse  said progress is being made toward democratization  and announced that Japan has no intention of changing its policy on Burma  Music to the junta s ears  perhaps  but I believe friends of the Burmese people must take a radically different  and principled  approach to a problem that kind words will only exacerbate   The world cannot stand by as the ruination of this country continues any farther  Free Burma s leaders  and her people  will remember which nations stood with them in their struggle against oppression  and which nations seemed to side with their oppressors   American and international policy towards Burma should reflect our conviction that oppression and impunity must come to an end  and that the regime must move towards a negotiated settlement with Aung San Suu Kyi that grants her a leading and irreversible political role culminating in free and fair national elections  If it does not  the regime will not be able to manage the transition  when it does come  for it will come without its consent   I believe the United States should immediately expand the visa ban against Burmese officials to include all members of the Union Solidarity Development Association  which organized the attack against Aung San Suu Kyi s delegation last weekend  The Administration should also immediately issue an executive order freezing the U S  assets of Burmese leaders  U N  special envoy Razali Ismail should not travel to Burma as planned this week unless he has assurances from the regime that he will be able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi   Congress should promptly consider legislation banning Burmese imports into the United States  and the Administration should encourage the European Union to back up its commitment to human rights in Burma with concrete steps in this direction  The U S  and the E U  together account for over 50 percent of Burma s exports and therefore enjoy considerable leverage against the regime  The United States alone absorbs between 20 and 25 percent of Burma s exports  Consideration of a U S  import ban should help focus attention in Rangoon on the consequences of flagrantly violating the human rights of the Burmese people and their chosen leaders  In coordination with a new U S  initiative  an E U  move in the direction of punitive trade sanctions would make the regime s continuing repression difficult if not impossible to sustain   The junta s latest actions are a desperate attempt by a decaying regime to stall freedom s inevitable progress  in Burma and across Asia  They will fail as surely as Aung San Suu Kyi s campaign for a free Burma will one day succeed                                                   June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by

APPROPRIATIONS BILL May 3  2006 Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  spoke before the United States Senate and submitted for the record the following statement on his amendment  to strike  74 5 million for grants to States based on their production of certain types of crops  livestock and dairy products  to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill   Mr  President  I call up Amendment  3616  and ask for its immediate consideration  This amendment would strike  74 5 million for grants to States based on their production of certain types of crops  livestock and dairy products  which was not included in the Administration s emergency supplemental request   Mr  President  it has been a longstanding policy in the United State Senate to prohibit the practice of adding authorizing language to an appropriations bill  Nevertheless  this bill includes a massive  3 94 billion Agriculture Assistance program  None of the funding under this agriculture title was included in the Administration s supplemental request  Interestingly  this nearly  4 billion add on  Title III of the underlying bill  received only a one paragraph mention in the entire Committee Report accompanying the bill  One paragraph to describe 31 pages of legislative language with a  4 billion price tag  Let me read it for the benefit of my colleagues who have not had the opportunity to review the report   TITLE III  EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE  The Committee recommends  3 944 000 000 for emergency agricultural disaster assistance  These funds will help farmers and ranchers in States affected by recent hurricanes  drought  flood  wildfire  and other natural disasters recover from resulting production losses  These funds will also assist in the removal of debris from watersheds in order to minimize the threat of flooding from future storm events  In addition  the funds will provide economic assistance to producers to compensate for high energy costs relating to agricultural production   Mr  President  I m all for helping to the extent appropriate farmers and other victims battered by hurricanes  But the agricultural assistance added in this bill is far more expansive than merely offering help to areas hit by the 2005 hurricanes and at least the limited report language doesn t hide that fact   As my colleagues know  the USDA currently has a range of disaster assistance programs including crop insurance programs that are already available  Yet this bill is going to add nearly  4 billion on top of the existing programs  In my view  the agriculture assistance funding is being used more as a vehicle to fill a voter wish list than it is meet the urgent needs of the victims of the 2005 hurricane season  Taxpayer dollars are being allocated for agriculture subsidies and bail outs which  in some cases  have nothing to do with hurricane recovery   Mr  President  my amendment would strike an earmark that provides  74 5 million in agriculture assistance for grants to States based on their production of specialty of crops  livestock and dairy products Why is this necessary  Have the hurricanes wiped out the specialty crop industry  What even is a specialty crop and why does it need  74 5 million of taxpayer funding  I hope that a specialty crop is a money tree because that is what is going to be needed to pay for this bill   My colleagues may be interested to know that the bill defines speciality crops as anything but wheat  feed grains  oilseeds  cotton  rice  or peanuts  Anything but  Why do we exclude those commodities from receiving this funding  Is sugarcane made ineligible   Are my colleagues aware that the USDA already has a Specialty Crop Block Grant Program that was authorized in 2004  Under the existing program  speciality crops are defined as fruits  vegetables  treenuts  dried fruits  and nursery crops  including floriculture  The program is funded at  7 million for the current fiscal year and it provides  100 000 grants to each State that applies  Is there a problem with that program that I am not aware of that gives just cause to providing it with an emergency supplemental appropriation to the tune of more one thousand percent above its annual appropriation   Mr  President  this bill provides  74 5 million that is to be used to award grants based on the share of each State s total value of specialty crop  livestock  and dairy production of the United states for the 2004 crop year multiplied by  74 5 million  That means the more you ve produced   if your crops have not been hit by a natural disaster or flooding or drought   the more money you get  That is the polar opposite of what the USDA disaster assistance programs are about  And doesn t that fly in the face of what an emergency supplemental is for  An emergency supplemental is supposed to be about addressing needs and not about providing rewards for productivity  And more importantly  why is what obviously is designed to be a nationwide agriculture funding assistance program   a program not requested by the Administration and singled out in the Statement of Administration Policy as objectionable   being included in a must pass emergency spending bill that is supposed to address the Global War on Terror and Hurricane recovery   My colleagues may be interested to know that under this legislation  States can use the grant to promote the purchase  sale or consumption of agricultural products  Hmm  Last week I mentioned that federal dollars had been used to paint salmon on airplanes  Maybe that  74 5 million will be used to paint vegetables on airplanes  Or maybe a pretty flower  Or maybe a nice acorn  How about some dried apricots or prunes  That would be sure to increase consumption   Upon closer reading of the legislative language  I notice that the appropriators actually have created a  100 million program for specialty crops  In addition to the  74 5 million  it provides for  25 5 million to make grants to the several States  the District of Columbia  and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to be used to support activities that promote agriculture  Again  I envision painted murals of specialty crops  not that anyone would know that when they are looking at a carrot  they are witness to a specialty crop   I hope the sponsors of this legislation will correct me if I m wrong  and I m confident that they will  but it appears that with respect to the  25 5 million funding  the bill provides that all 50 states will each receive  500 000 of that money  while Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia each will receive  250 000  Mr  President  what specialty crops are grown in DC   What kind of campaign should we expect from the District of Columbia as it uses these funds to support activities that promote agriculture  Will they paint vegetables on the metro trains   This funding is not needed  Mr  President   It should be noted that according to OMB In 2005  many crops had record or near record production  and U S  farm sector cash receipts were the second highest ever  Can a unrequested  74 4 million grant program truly be sold as an urgent  emergency spending need at this time   Mr  President  I know my colleagues have the highest hopes for the success and safety of our troops  and for the speedy recovery of the hurricane ravaged Gulf  But when the American people hear of these special interest riders  they re going to question our priorities   and rightly so   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment                                             May

                                                                                                                        STATEMENT ON MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT June 6  2006 Washington  DC   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  spoke on the floor of the United States Senate about the Marriage Protection Amendment   The following is the text of his statement as prepared and submitted for the record   Mr  President  I believe that the institution of marriage can serve its public purposes only when it is understood as being a union between one man and one woman  It is this understanding that offers public reinforcement to the vital and unique roles played by mothers and fathers in the raising of their children  It is this understanding that offers a foundation for principled objections to those who would pursue the imprudent agenda of dismantling an institution that has served us well  and replacing it with newer and more flexible understandings that are of questionable public value   I also believe in the institution of republican government as described in the United States Constitution  This  too  is an institution that has served us well  founded upon the precept that the American people speak through their elected representatives  and these representatives remain at all times answerable and accountable to the people whom they serve  Today  on the question of marriage  we are told by advocates on both sides of the debate that these two institutions  as they are currently understood  cannot be reconciled  and that one or the other must be changed  I do not agree  and thus I do not at this time support the proposed Marriage Protection Amendment   The proposed amendment would establish in our Constitution a permanent resolution of a debate that is currently and properly being resolved in different ways  in fifty different states  by the people s elected representatives  Our system of federalism is not easily separable from our commitment to republican government  because it is driven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent us live where we live  and share the values that we share  It is this understanding that has allowed us the strength  as a nation  to time and again preserve our unity and confront our challenges in times of crisis  no matter how great our differences on issues that are the subject of heated public debate  The continued vitality of America s commitment to federalism and republican government offers a hopeful example to strife torn areas of our world where conflicts are tragically settled with bullets rather than ballots  The Constitutional value of federalism is doubly important in the area of family law  because power to legislate in this area has traditionally been reserved to the states  and because issues of family structure affect the fabric of the broader community  creating the opportunity for approaches that reflect the values of the states that form our nation   Most Americans believe  as do I  that the institution of marriage should be reserved for the union of a man and a woman  Wherever the question of same sex marriage has been put to the test of public approval  it has been decisively rejected  Presently  nineteen states protect in their constitutions traditional definitions of marriage  In 2004  amendments to state constitutions preserving the institution of marriage exclusively as the union of a man and woman were placed on the ballot in thirteen states  All thirteen passed by substantial margins  Thus far  seven states have a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year  There is little doubt they will all prevail  Proponents of an amendment to my state s constitution  which I support  are working hard to collect the required number of signatures to secure a place on the November ballot  If we succeed  I am certain Arizonans will adopt it overwhelmingly   There can be little doubt that a sizeable majority of the American people  whatever their views on other questions involving the rights of homosexuals in our society  strongly support reserving the institution of marriage for the union of one man and one woman  That majority includes  I am confident  majorities in every state in the union  It includes Americans of both political parties  whose voting habits and general political philosophy range from conservative to moderate to liberal   It is obvious that there is a broad consensus in this country in support of the traditional definition of marriage  And  Mr  President  when the American people are so decided in a public debate their elected representatives will defend that consensus  Forty five states have either constitutional protections or statutes on the books defining marriage in traditional terms  In 1996  Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act  which allows each state to deny within its boundaries the status of marriage to the union of a same sex couple that may have been recognized in another state  To date  the Defense of Marriage Act has not been successfully challenged in federal court   The broad consensus in support of traditional marriage does not yet extend to support for the measure we are debating today  an amendment to the federal constitution defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman  I suspect that is because most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same sex couples   Obviously  the Massachusetts Supreme Court s ruling in 2003 effectively extended lawful marriage to same sex couples even though it is apparent that a majority of Massachusetts residents do not support that change in the interpretation of the state s marriage laws  But there are political remedies to what  I believe  can be fairly criticized as judicial activism that ignored the will of the people and denied a state government its long established right to regulate marriage  In Massachusetts  more than 120 000 voters signed a petition to place on the ballot an amendment to the Commonwealth s constitution restoring the traditional definition of marriage  A constitutional convention to consider amending the Massachusetts constitution is scheduled to convene on July 12th   The Nebraska decision is under review by the U S  Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit  which has already heard oral arguments in the case  and might issue a ruling as early as this summer  Most analysts  on both sides of the debate  believe the lower court s decision will be reversed  and the exclusive protections for traditional marriage that the people of Nebraska adopted in 2000 by a vote of 70  will be restored to their constitution  Nebraska s Attorney General has not even felt it necessary to ask for a stay of the district court s decision pending the outcome of the appeal  which would almost certainly have been granted  I assume this is because Nebraska still has a defense of marriage law on the books  and there are no same sex marriage cases pending in Nebraska courts or same sex marriage legislation pending in the Nebraska legislature   I understand that the precipitous Massachusetts decision  as well as the unlawful granting of marriage licenses to same sex couples in a few localities outside Massachusetts  challenges to traditional marriage laws in other states  and the decision last year by the federal district court in Nebraska that struck down an amendment to Nebraska s constitution restricting marriage to a man and a woman have added to the support for a federal marriage amendment  While that support does not mirror the broad national consensus in support of traditional marriage  it is substantial and passionate  I understand that and I respect it  and I agree that marriage as a uniquely important institution should be protected  But I do not agree that all the above circumstances have made it necessary to usurp from the states  by means of an amendment to the federal Constitution  their traditional role in regulating marriage  I m reluctant to abandon the federalism that is part of the essence of conservative political thought in our country  And I am very wary of the unintended consequences that might follow from making an exception to our federalist principles for the sake of addressing a threat to the institution of marriage that may still  indeed  seems likely to be  defeated by means far less precedent setting than amending our nation s Constitution   Of course  while I disagree that the current Constitutional structure provides insufficient mechanisms for ensuring that the public meaning of marriage is not tampered with by activist judges  it would be disingenuous to argue that those who support the proposed Amendment have no grounds for their concern  In recent decades there have been too many occasions on which the federal courts  including the Supreme Court  have forgotten their proper role  and abandoned the virtues of federalism and republican government in favor of imposing their own policy preferences in the guise of Constitutional interpretation  Decisions such as Roe v  Wade continue to distort the democratic process in ways large and small to this very day  It is a telling commentary on those who seek to change the longstanding public meaning of marriage that in many instances they have chosen to pursue their agenda through the courts rather than taking their case to the people  Those who wish to engage the issue in good faith should reject out of hand attempts to read into the Constitution a right to same sex marriage  because the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it  and because the longstanding traditions of American society have defined legal marriage as a union between one man and one woman  Indeed  yet another reason I am reluctant to support the proposed Amendment at this point in time is that I do not accept the proposition that the current Constitution could ever reasonably be read to contain a supposed  right  that it plainly does not contain   It is just not clear to me  Mr  President  that threats to the institution of marriage that have arisen in recent times have become a permanent breach of state authorities  traditional role in regulating and defining marriage as the people of their states and their elected representatives see fit  My confidence that the public meaning of marriage will be decided in the context of federalism and republican government rather than by judicial fiat is strengthened by the recent confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito  and I hope that future appointments to the state and federal courts give us judges who share a similar understanding of the courts  proper role in our Constitutional system   However  if I am wrong  and the Nebraska decision were to be upheld on appeal  or were other challenges to state marriage laws made and upheld  or if majority sentiment and legislative remedies in affected states fail to overcome peremptory judicial intrusions into the political process of defining marriage  or if the Supreme Court were to reject the Defense of Marriage Act  then  and only then  would the problem justify Congress making the momentous decision to amend the most enduring and successful political compact in human history as the only recourse means to restore the public s right to define  according to the values and concerns of our communities  a critically important foundation of our society   Let me pose a hypothetical situation  Mr  President  to illustrate why we should be reluctant to impose a Constitutional remedy to a problem that will probably be resolved in an ordinary  state by state political process  consistent with the respect for federalism we Republicans have long claimed as one of our virtues  Those of us who consider ourselves pro life would welcome the Supreme Court s reversal of the Roe v  Wade decision that found a Constitutional right to an abortion  The result of that reversal would be to return the regulation of abortion to the states  where the values of local communities would be influential  Now  further suppose that abortion rights advocates held majorities in both houses of Congress  and rather than argue state by state for liberal abortion laws  they decided to usurp the states  authority by means of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion  Wouldn t we who consider ourselves federalists loudly protest such a move  Wouldn t we all line up on the floor to quote Mr  Madison from Federalist Paper 45  that the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects  which  in the ordinary course of affairs  concern the lives  liberties and properties of the people  and the internal order  improvement and prosperity of the State  Yes  we would  Mr  President  yes  we would   Mr  President  I believe that in the ordinary course of affairs  the American people s clear preference to retain intact the institution of marriage  defined according to the values of our communities as the union of one man and one woman  will prevail  and that attempts to ignore the people s will  either by judicial fiat or by the occasional enterprising politician will  in due course  be overcome  I might be wrong  Mr  President  and I respect the concerns of Americans who believe current circumstances urgently require the Constitutional protection of traditionally defined marriage  But I do not believe that recent developments yet pose a threat to marriage that cannot be overcome by means short of a Constitutional amendment   While I will vote in opposition to this amendment  I believe its advocates should be reassured that if in the future the public meaning of marriage is taken from the hands of the people and altered by judges who claim falsely to speak before all others for the people s constitutional ideals  then it will be the people  acting through their elected representatives in this chamber  who will at that time have the final word  Until then  however  I will trust in the American people and the elected representatives closest to them to pass and enforce laws upholding the institution of marriage in accord with the values of their communities                                                      June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by

2006    Washington D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following remarks for the record regarding the 2007 Agriculture Appropriations Bill   Mr  President  yesterday the Senate briefly turned to H R  5384  the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2007  This bill appropriates about  98 billion in spending  an amount that is approximately  4 9 billion over the Administrations budget request  and  4 7 billion more than the House passed bill  Although we were unable to complete work on H R  5384  I want to explain my objections to the passage of this bill in its current form   Mr  President  I believe that some federal involvement is necessary to assist low income families under the food stamp program  and that we should ensure that our farmers stay out of the red  and to this end  many of the programs under the Agriculture Department are worthwhile and I support their funding  I know that many of my colleagues have spoken before the Senate about the economic struggles of  America s farmers  But as Congress looks ahead towards legislating a new farm bill in the near future  next year in fact  we once again conform to the practice of diverting taxpayer dollars into an array of special interest pork projects which have not been authorized or requested by the Administration   Lets take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this bill and accompanying report    3 5 million for fruit fly control in   Texas   which was not in the Administrations budget request    400 000 for codling moth research in  Kerneysville  West Virginia   which was not in the Administrations budget request    200 000 for research into the genetic enhancement of barely in  Aberdeen  Idaho   which was not in the Administrations budget request    300 000 for grass research in burns   Oregon   which was not in the Administrations budget request    750 000 to the Denali Commission to improve solid waste disposal sites in  Alaska   which was not in the Administrations budget request    200 000 for the   Utah  State  University s Space Dynamics Laboratory to study gaseous emissions from agriculture operations  which was not in the Administrations budget request     100 000 to study crop pollination by bees   Logan  UT   which was not in the Administrations budget request    600 000 for the U S  Dairy Forage Research Center in  Madison  Wisconsin   which was not in the Administrations budget request    250 000 for shellfish and salmon research   Franklin  Maine   which was not in the Administrations budget request    250 000 for the  Great Lakes  Aquaculture  Center    Coshocton  Ohio   which was not in the Administrations budget request    158 000 for cranberry research   Massachusetts    1 4 million for Potato Research  state not listed     453 000 for seafood safety research    Massachusetts     4 1 million for shrimp aquiculture research in AZ  HI  MA  MS  SC  and TX    780 000 for milk safety research at  Pennsylvania State University  PA   which was not in the Administrations budget request    170 000 for blackbird management in the State of  Kansas   which was not in the Administrations budget request   Mr  President  its worth noting what were already doing to support our nations agriculture producers  Last year  federal farm subsidies grew to more than  23 billion despite near record farm revenue which reached  76 billion  While some of these farm programs make good fiscal sense  other have become alarmingly wasteful and counterproductive   For example  The Washington Post recently exposed a USDA program  known as direct and counter cyclical payments  that in 2005 paid out  1 3 billion to farmers irrespective of high or low market prices or whether they grew any crops at all  This program was intended to be a temporary subsidy that would prop up farmers during poor market conditions  but the special interests and the farm lobby convinced Congress to keep this unneeded program  which has become perhaps the most abused farm subsidy in existence   The Washington Post also discovered that in 2002 and 2003   635 million in drought assistance went to ranchers and dairy farmers whose livestock experienced mild or no drought at all  Thanks to strong lobbying by cattle growers  the Congress modified the payment requirements under the Livestock Compensation program for 2002 2003  so that ranchers werent required to prove they suffered any actual losses  So long as a the disaster was declared  the government simply mailed checks to ranchers dependant only on the number of cattle they owned   In an offshoot of the USDAs drought relief efforts  the federal government paid  34 million to compensate catfish farmers for feed they purchased during the 2002 drought year  even though feed prices were at a ten year low  Much like the cattle program  catfish farmers were not required to prove they suffered any losses  All they had to do was tell the USDA how much feed they bought that year   Who is at fault for this egregious waste  The farmer  The Department of Agriculture  In reality  both are the victims of bad policy  Unfortunately  the biggest victim is the taxpayer  and the blame rests with us  the Congress  Our current farm policy is riddled with waste  Yet we compound matters by furthering the out of control earmarking of pork   Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to insert into the record copies of The Washington Post articles I cited  Farm Program Pays   13 Billion to People Who Dont Farm  July 2  2006   No Drought Required For Federal Drought Aid  July 18  2006   and When Feed Was Cheap  Catfish Farmers Got Help Buying It  July 18  2006    Mr  President  its difficult to overlook the  4 5 billion disaster assistance package that appropriators have attached to this bill  None of this funding under this agricultural title is included in the administration s request  and in fact  was strongly opposed by the Administration when similar provision were added to the 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill  My colleagues may recall that the emergency supplemental faced a veto threat because of the billions of dollars in unrequested agriculture handouts appropriators were seeking  Fortunately these agriculture subsidies were removed in conference  and the bill was finally enacted enabling crucial funding to reach out troops overseas   Lets take a look at some of the provisions in this latest Agriculture disaster package    1 billion in crop disaster assistance to compensate farmers for damage that occurred in 2005 due to weather  This also specifically applies to the Mormon Cricket infestation in Nevada  and flooding in California  Hawaii and   Vermont    13 million to help Ewe Lamb farmers whove suffered populations losses    6 million to owners of flooded crop and grazing land in   North Dakota    6 million to assist a sugarcane transportation cooperative in  Hawaii    100 million for grants to each state to promote specialty crop production    1 7 billion in assistance to dairy farmers who suffered losses in 2005   Mr  President  this appropriations measure is not expected to receive any further action during this session of Congress  Instead of debating and passing our annual spending bills  our constitutional obligation  were resorting to passing continuing resolutions to maintain our government functions well into fiscal year 2007  This failure is partially because of our habit of earmarking  When members frantically look for appropriation bills as vehicles for pet projects and unrequested earmarks  the appropriation process becomes a game of you vote for my pork  Ill vote for yours  This is the sad state of our appropriations process  when wed rather postpone funding for critical programs for our farmers  soldiers  veterans and seniors and nearly everything until next year if it means our pork isnt included this round   Mr  President  again I want to make it clear that I support doing all that we can for the American farmer  Agriculture production is part of the backbone of our great country  However  we do more bad than good by raiding the national treasury  and in some cases other Agriculture programs  to pay for pet projects that in many cases benefits a certain constituency which is not representative of the larger needs of the farming community

COURT January 5  2006 Washington D C   Today United States Senator John McCain spoke on the floor of the United States Senate and submitted the following statement for the record   Mr  President  as we all know  elections have consequences  When President Bush ran for reelection  he stated plainly and often that  if given the opportunity  he would nominate conservative judges to the Supreme Court  True to his promise  the President nominated John Roberts to become the 18th Chief Justice of the United States  Just as true  he nominated Samuel Alito to serve as an Associate Justice of the Court   I was pleased that the President nominated Judge Alito  as were many other members of this body  Though very favorably disposed  I reserved final judgment on his nomination out of respect for both the confirmation process and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  I do not take the Senate s advice and consent role lightly  and I did not want to encourage a rush to judgment without the benefit of public hearings   Those hearings have occurred  and since then I have announced that I will vote to confirm Judge Alito  Through 18 hours and over 700 questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee  the judge demonstrated that he will be an intelligent  fair  and open minded Justice who respects the judiciary s important but limited role of interpreting the law  I believe that he is worthy of not only my own support  but that of other members of this body  And  certainly  this nominee deserves an up or down vote   Judge Alito has earned the highest rating of the American Bar Association  As stated by Stephen Tober  the chairman of the ABA s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary  to merit an evaluation of well qualified  the ABA s highest rating  the nominee must possess professional qualifications and achievements of the highest standing  Mr  Tober went on to testify  We are ultimately persuaded that Judge Alito has  throughout his 15 years on the Federal bench  established a record of both proper judicial conduct and even handed application in seeking to do what is fundamentally fair       His integrity  his professional competence  and his judicial temperament are  indeed  found to be of the highest standard  Of the highest standard  Mr  President   The ABA s conclusions are based in part on interviews of 300 individuals throughout our Nation  130 Federal judges  many State judges  and many colleagues  co counsel  and opposing counsel  According to the ABA s testimony  these individuals almost uniformly talked in terms of his evenhandedness  of his open mindedness  of his willingness to be fair  He s called a judge s judge more than once in those interviews  A former clerk of Judge Alito  Professor Nora Demleitner  testified before the Judiciary Committee that the judge is a man of great integrity  decency  and character  And I say this as a left leaning Democrat  a member of the ACLU  a woman  and an immigrant  I am not alone in this view of Judge Alito  I know many others who have clerked for and worked with Judge Alito  and everyone has only positive words about him  Each and every one of us has unfailing respect and regard for him  his character  his wit and his humanity  All of his clerks  many of whom are politically liberal  have signed on to a letter strongly urging the Senate to confirm Judge Alito as Associate Justice  Professor Demleitner later explained that the judge earned such support and respect because Judge Alito has always tried to follow the law and decided cases on their individual merits  And there are plenty of other examples of strong support for Judge Alito from people of all political stripes  Listen to what former 3rd Circuit Judge Tim Lewis said in testimony before the Judiciary Committee   It is no coincidence to anyone who is familiar with my body of work while I served on the United States Court of Appeals and my body of work since having left the court that I happen to be sitting on the far left of this panel here this afternoon       I am openly and unapologetically pro choice and always have been      I am very  very much involved in a number of endeavors that one who is familiar with Judge Alito s background and experience may wonder  well  why are you here today saying positive things about his prospects as a Justice on the Supreme Court         I n the end I am here as a matter of principle and as a matter of my own commitment to justice  to fairness  and my sense that Sam Alito is uniformly qualified in all important respects to serve as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court   Mr  President  Judge Lewis has it exactly right  different does not mean unqualified  and if we are going to be respectful of the advice and consent role that we are playing here we must set aside partisanship and focus on the nominee s qualifications and integrity  which in the case of Judge Alito are above reproach  Many of us did just that when we voted in favor of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer  No one can argue with a straight face that the facts before lead to any other reasonable conclusion   The statements of support that I have read show that the debate over Judge Alito may be partisan in the Senate and among some interest groups  but those who know him best support Judge Alito regardless of where they are on the political spectrum  whether they are liberal or conservative  Democrat or Republican  This strong bipartisan support for Judge Alito based on his professional qualifications and judgment leads me to suggest that the Senate should vote as soon as possible to make this judge a Justice of the Supreme Court  As the president said earlier this week  There has been no sign of any extraordinary circumstance except for this extraordinary thing  he s extraordinarily capable to serve on the Supreme Court  I could not agree more   Mr  President  Judge Alito is a man of outstanding qualifications whose record as a thoughtful conservative has won my vote  Without any reasonable doubt  it has also earned the support of this body                                                     January 2006 Press Releases

2007 Washington  D C      U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today introduced the Indian Tribes Methamphetamine Act of 2007  Below are Senator McCain   s remarks as submitted for the record       Mr  President  today I am introducing the Indian Tribes Methamphetamine Reduction Grants Act of 2007  This bill is identical to S  4113  a bipartisan measure that was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on December 8  2006  the last day of the 109th Congress  The legislation would allow Indian tribes to be eligible for funding through the Department of Justice to eradicate the scourge of methamphetamine use  sale and manufacture in Native American communities  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dorgan  Baucus  Grassley  Reid  Feinstein  and Feingold in introducing this important legislation      Mr  President  the impacts of methamphetamine use on communities across the Nation are well known and cannot be overstated  Methamphetamine is the leading drug related law enforcement problem in the country  Unfortunately  the meth crisis is affecting Indian Country most severely  Very serious concerns have been raised by the U S  Department of Justice  states  and other non tribal law enforcement agencies over the rapidly growing levels of methamphetamine production and trafficking on reservations with large geographic areas or tribes adjacent to the U S  Mexico border  But because of the sovereign status of the tribes  criminals are generally not subject to state jurisdiction in many cases  As a result  local law enforcement often has no jurisdiction in Indian country  and tribal law enforcement agencies bear the brunt of most law enforcement functions      The problem of meth in Indian country  which the National Congress of American Indians identified last year as its top priority  is ubiquitous  and has strained already overburdened law enforcement  health  social welfare  housing  and child protective and placement services on Indian reservations  Last year a former tribal judge on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and other drugs  The day before  the Navajo Nation police arrested an 81 year old grandmother  her daughter  and her granddaughter  for selling meth  One tribe in Arizona had over 60 babies born with meth in their systems  In 2005  the National Indian Housing Council expanded its training for dealing with meth in tribal housing  the average cost of decontaminating a single residence that has been used a meth lab is  10 000       During the 109th Congress  as the Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee  I held hearings on this serious matter  Committee witnesses testified that the methamphetamine epidemic in Indian country has contributed to a rise in child abuse and neglect cases  among other social ills  and some tribes reported dramatic increases in suicide rates among young people linked to methamphetamine use  Following our hearings  I was pleased to work with Senators Dorgan  Session  Bingaman and others in improving upon our legislation to assist Indian Country in fighting this terrible drug crisis      To avoid any potential misinterpretation of the intent of this legislation  this bill includes language developed and agreed to during the last Congress that is designed to clarify the intent of the bill  This clarifying language  provided in section 2 a  4  of the bill  is intended to make it clear that by authorizing the Department of Justice   s Bureau of Justice Assistance to award grant funds to a state  territory or Indian tribe to    investigate  arrest and prosecute individuals    involved in illegal methamphetamine activities  the legislation does not somehow authorize a grantee state  territory or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities that it otherwise has no jurisdiction to pursue  And similarly  this provision also clarifies that an award or denial of a grant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance does not somehow allow a state  territory or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities that it otherwise lacks jurisdiction to pursue  For example  a law enforcement agency in one state  territory or Indian reservation is not somehow enabled by this section  or by an award made pursuant to this section  to prosecute a methamphetamine crime arising in some other jurisdiction unless that agency already has such jurisdiction      The legislation further clarifies that authority under the bill to award grants would have no effect beyond simply authorizing  awarding or denying a grant of funds to a state  territory or Indian tribe  So  for example  if a state  territory or Indian tribe is awarded or denied a grant of funds under this section  that award or denial has no relevance to or effect on the eligibility of the state  territory or Indian tribe to participate in any other program or activity unrelated to the award or denial of grants as permitted under this legislation  The award or denial of a grant under this subsection  in other words  is relevant only to the award or denial of the grant under this subsection  and nothing else      The measure I am introducing today takes but a small step on the long journey toward our fight against methamphetamine  I encourage my colleagues to support it                                                 January 2007 Press Releases

12  2007 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement before the Senate Committee on Armed Servicespreceding testimony byChairman of the Joint ChiefsPeter Pace and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on the current situation in Iraq    Chairman Levin  Thank you   I join our Chairman in welcoming our witnesses here today  I am very pleased to serve again with the returning members of our Committee and wish to welcome all of the new members to the Committee   Mr  Chairman  it is a hard thing to change course in the middle of a war  I commend the President for recognizing the mistakes of the past  and for outlining new steps on the military  economic  and political fronts  I believe that  together  these moves will give the Iraqis     and America     the best chance of success    We should make no mistake   the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure demand that we do all we can to prevail in Iraq  A substantial and sustained increase in U S  forces in Baghdad and Anbar province is necessary to bring down the toxic levels of violence there    There is much agreement that the dire situation in Iraq demands a political solution  That is true  But we must also realize what it will take to enable any political solution  It is simply impossible for meaningful political and economic activity to take place in an environment as riddled with violence as Baghdad is today  Security is the precondition for political and economic progress    Until the government and its coalition allies can protect the population  the Iraqi people will increasingly turn to extra governmental forces  especially Sunni and Shiite militias  for protection  Only when the government has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force will its authority have meaning  and only when its authority has meaning can political activity have the results we seek     The presence of additional coalition forces would allow the Iraqi government to do what it cannot accomplish today on its own   impose its rule throughout the country  They can do this by engaging in traditional counterinsurgency activities aimed at protecting the population and breaking the cycle of violence  In bringing greater security to Iraq  and chiefly to Baghdad  our forces would give the government a fighting chance to pursue reconciliation   As I have said before  a small  short surge would be the worst of all worlds  We need troops in the numbers required to do the job  in place for as long as it takes to complete their mission  We must ensure that we are committing sufficient numbers of additional troops  and I look forward to our witnesses    testimony on this score  It would be far better to have too many reinforcements in Iraq than to suffer  once again  the tragic results of insufficient force levels   The other elements of the President   s strategy are also critical  The Iraqi government must meet new benchmarks  including a reconciliation process for insurgents and Baathists  more equitable distribution of government resources  sharing oil revenue with the entire Iraqi population  and holding provincial elections that will bring Sunnis into government  And Iraq   s neighbors need to play a more constructive role  I would like to see the Saudis  for example  fund a major jobs creation program in Iraq  The Gulf states must not fiddle while Baghdad burns     I know that some of my colleagues disagree with a troop increase in Iraq  and I have heard the calls for a withdrawal to begin in 4 to 6 months  Those who advocate such a policy have a right     even an obligation     to join the debate on this issue  But I believe these individuals also have a responsibility to tell us what they believe are the consequences of withdrawal in Iraq  Do they not fear Iranian  Saudi  and Turkish involvement in Iraq  A wider regional war  A haven for terrorists  A humanitarian catastrophe  Do they truly believe that we can walk away from Iraq     We were able to walk away from Vietnam  If we walk away from Iraq  we will be back     possibly in the context of a wider war in the world   s most volatile region  I believe that those who disagree with this new policy should indicate what they would propose to do if we withdraw and Iraq descends into chaos     We have made many  many mistakes since 2003  and these will not be easily reversed  Even greater than the costs thus far and in the future  however  are the catastrophic consequences that would ensue from our failure in Iraq  By surging troops and bringing security to Baghdad and other areas  we will give the Iraqis and their partners the best possible chances to succeed    From everything I saw during my trip to Iraq last month  I believe that success is still possible  And I would not support this new strategy if I didn   t think it had a real chance of success  But let us realize that there are no guarantees  By controlling the violence  we can pave the way for a political settlement  Once the government wields greater authority  however  Iraqi leaders must take significant steps on their own  and they must do it right away   Increasing U S  troop levels will expose more brave Americans to danger and increase the number of American casualties  When Congress authorized this war  we were committing America to a mission that entails the greatest sacrifice a country can make  one that falls disproportionately on those Americans who love their country so much that they volunteer to risk their lives to accomplish that mission  And when we authorized this war  we accepted the responsibility to make sure they could prevail  Increasing deployments is a terrible sacrifice to impose on the best patriots among us  My travels and meeting with many service members lead me to believe  however  that these Americans will once again do everything they can to win this war   I will conclude by commending the President   s announcement Wednesday night that he plans to increase the standing size of the Army and Marine Corps by some 92 000 soldiers and Marines  Such a step is long overdue  particularly given our commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan  and I believe that the increase in end strength is in the national security interests of our country  I hope it will receive the backing of all senators   Chairman Levin  thank you  I look forward to the testimony of

Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following remarks at an Independence Day re enlistment and naturalization ceremony in Baghdad       I want to thank General Petraeus  and I want to thank all of you for allowing me the privilege of witnessing this ceremony  I can think of no place I would rather be on the day our country celebrates our independence than with you  you who have risked everything so that we remain free  free from fear and danger  free from the grave harm our enemies wish to inflict on us       I know it is not possible for even the most grateful nation to compensate you in kind for the measure of devotion you have  at great personal sacrifice  given our country  We have incurred a debt to you that we can never repay in full  We can offer you only the small tribute of our humility  You are the best Americans  and our best efforts to honor our debts to you will fall far short of what you have given and what you deserve  What you have done for us  we can never do for you  But we are mindful of that distinction  and humbled by it  And our appreciation for your service demands of us all to do what we can  in less trying and less costly circumstances  to help keep our nation a place and an idea worthy of the hardships  danger and sacrifices you have borne so valiantly for us      When a nation goes to war  a million tragedies ensue  It is terrible thing  war  but not the worst thing  You know that  you who have endured the dangers and deprivations of war so that the worst thing would not befall us  so that America might be secure in her freedom  As you know  the war in which you have fought has divided the American people  But it has divided no American in their admiration for you  We all honor you  We are all    those who supported the decision that placed you in harm   s way and those who opposed it     we are all humbled by your example  and chastened in our prideful conviction that we  too  in our own way  have offered our country some good service  It may be true or it may not  but no matter how measurable our own contributions to our blessed and beautiful country  they are a poor imitation of yours  We know how little we have given compared to your service  and the solemn and terrible sacrifice made by those Americans who will never return to the country they loved so well       It is a sad and hard thing to ask so much more of Americans who have already given more than their fair share to the defense of our country  Yet the stakes in Iraq are so high  not only for the people of this country and the region  but for the American people  So we have asked you to do more than we should expect of you  And here you are  re enlisting so that we might to continue to rely on your courage and patriotism in our hour of need  And those of you who today become naturalized citizens of our country begin your citizenship with America already in your debt  In this place  in this hour  you are more important to our country than many able bodied Americans  who live safe and contented lives because you protect them  and whose ancestors might have arrived on the Mayflower  You have made our country better than it was before you came to America  and I am deeply grateful to you       All of you surely miss your families  All of you would rather spend this holiday in your own towns and communities  among your loved ones and friends  Many of you have served multiple tours here or in Afghanistan  And I know that we could not expect you or your families to be happy about this deployment  I expect a few of you might not have received the news without a few appropriate complaints aimed in the general direction of people like me  who have helped make the decision to send you here again  And then you shouldered a rifle and risked everything     everything     to accomplish your mission  to protect another people   s freedom and our own country from harm      It is a privilege beyond measure to live in a country served by you  I have lived a long  eventful and blessed life  I have had the good fortune of knowing personally a great many brave and selfless patriots who sacrificed and shed blood to defend their country  But I   ve none braver or better than you  You are my inspiration  and your country   s  I pray to a loving God that He bless and protect you  Thank you

the Senate has reached another moment of great importance  In debating the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill  we will help set the course of our nation   s security policy and influence our participation in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  Much of the debate will be about Iraq  and I will have more to say about that important matter in a few moments  Before I do  I would like to note the many provisions in this bill that constitute good defense policy and that will strengthen the ability of our country to defend itself  That is why the Committee voted unanimously to report the bill  It fully funds the President   s  648 billion defense budget request  it provides necessary measures to avoid waste  fraud and abuse in defense procurement  and it makes Members accountable for their spending      I would like to thank Chairman Levin  the subcommittee chairs  and all the Committee members for their work in bringing this measure to the floor  We have a good bill  We   ve authorized a 3 5 percent across the board pay raise for all military personnel and we   ve increased Army and Marine end strength to 525 400 and 189 000  respectively  I hope that by boosting these numbers we can build a more flexible active duty force and deploy reservists more prudently       The Committee also approved  2 7 billion for items on the Army Chief of Staff   s Unfunded Requirements List  including  775 million for reactive armor and other Stryker requirements   207 million for aviation survivability equipment   102 million for combat training centers  and funding for explosive ordnance disposal equipment  night vision devices and machine guns  The bill also authorizes  4 1 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected  MRAP  vehicles for all of the Services    known requirements       The Committee has come up with the money to support our troops  and I have no doubt that the full Senate will follow step  Money and policy statements  however  are not all that is required at this moment in our nation   s history  Courage is required  Mr  President  Not the great courage exhibited by the brave men and women fighting today in Iraq and Afghanistan  but a smaller measure  the courage necessary to put our country   s interests before every personal or political consideration       In this light I would like to discuss America   s involvement in Iraq  The final reinforcements needed to implement General Petraeus    new counter insurgency strategy arrived several weeks ago  and last week I had the opportunity to visit these troops in theatre  From what I saw and heard while there  I believe that our military  in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces  is making progress in a number of areas  I   d like to outline some of their efforts  not to argue that these areas have suddenly become safe     they have not     but to illustrate the progress that our military has achieved under General Petraeus   s new strategy       The most dramatic advances have been made in Anbar Province  a region that last year was widely believed to be lost to al Qaeda  After an offensive by U S  and Iraqi troops cleaned al Qaeda fighters out of Ramadi and other areas of western Anbar  the province   s tribal sheikhs broke formally with the terrorists and joined the coalition side  Ramadi  which just months ago stood as Iraq   s most dangerous city  is now one of its safest  In February  attacks in Ramadi averaged between 30 and 35  now many days see no attacks at all     no gunfire  no IEDs  and no suicide bombings  In Falluja  Iraqi police have established numerous stations and have divided the city into gated districts  leading to a decline in violence  Local intelligence tips have proliferated in the province  thousands of men are signing up for the police and army  and the locals are taking the fight to al Qaeda  U S  commanders in Anbar attest that all 18 major tribes in the province are now on board with the security plan  and they expect that a year from now the Iraqi army and police could have total control of security in Ramadi  At that point  they project  we could safely draw down American forces in the area       The Anbar model is one that our military is attempting to replicate in other parts of Iraq  with some real successes  A brigade of the 10th Mountain Division is operating in the areas south of Baghdad  the belts around the capital which have been havens for al Qaeda and other insurgents  All soldiers in the brigade are    living forward     and commanders report that the local sheikhs are increasingly siding with the coalition against al Qaeda  the main enemy in that area of operations  Southeast of Baghdad  the military is targeting al Qaeda in safe havens they maintain along the Tigris River  These and other efforts are part of Operation Phantom Thunder  a military operation intended to stop insurgents present in the Baghdad belts from originating attacks in the capital itself       In Baghdad  the military  in cooperation with Iraqi security forces  continues to establish joint security stations and deploy throughout the city in order to get violence under control  These efforts have produced positive results  sectarian violence has fallen since January  the total number of car bombings and suicide attacks declined in May and June  and the number of locals coming forward with intelligence tips has risen  Make no mistake     violence in Baghdad remains at unacceptably high levels  suicide bombers and other threats pose formidable challenges  and other difficulties abound  Nevertheless  there appears to be overall movement in the right direction       North of Baghdad  Iraqi and American troops have surged into Diyala Province and are fighting to deny al Qaeda sanctuary in the city of Baqubah  For the first time since the war began  Americans showed up in force and did not quickly withdraw from the area  In response  locals have formed a new alliance with the coalition to counter al Qaeda  Diyala  which was the center of Abu Musab al Zarqawi   s proposed    Islamic caliphate     finally has a chance to turn aside the forces of extremism      I offer these observations  Mr  President  not in order to present a rosy scenario of the challenges we continue to face in Iraq  As last weekend   s horrific bombing in Salahuddin Province illustrates so graphically  the threats to Iraqi stability have not gone away  Nor are they likely to go away in the near future  and our brave men and women in Iraq will continue to face great challenges  What I do believe  however  is that  while the mission     to bring a degree of security to Iraq  and to Baghdad and its environs in particular  in order to establish the necessary precondition for political and economic progress     while that mission is still in its early stages  the progress our military has made should encourage all of us       It is also clear that the overall strategy that General Petraeus has put into place     a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protecting the population  and which gets our troops off of the bases and into the areas they are trying to protect     that this strategy is the correct one  Some of my colleagues argue that we should return troops to the forward operating bases and confine their activities to training and targeted counterterrorism operations  That is precisely what we did for three and a half years  Mr  President  and the situation in Iraq only got worse  I am frankly surprised that my colleagues would advocate a return to the failed Rumsfeld Casey strategy  No one can be certain whether this new strategy  which remains in the early stages  can bring about ever greater stability  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Senate seek to legislate an end to the strategy as it is just commencing     should we do that  Mr  President  then we will fail for certain       Now that the military effort in Iraq is showing some signs of progress  the space is opening for political progress  Yet rather than seizing the opportunity  the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not functioning as it must  We see little evidence of reconciliation and little progress toward meeting the benchmarks laid out by the President  The Iraqi government can function  the question is whether it will       To encourage political progress  I believe that we can find wisdom in several suggestions put forward recently by Henry Kissinger  An intensified negotiation among the Iraqi parties could limit violence  promote reconciliation  and put the political system on a more stable footing  At the same time  we should promote a dialogue between the Iraqi government and its Sunni Arab neighbors     specifically Egypt  Jordan  and Saudi Arabia     in order to build broader international acceptance for the Iraqi central government  in exchange for that government meeting specific obligations with respect to the protection and political participation of the Sunni minority  These countries should cease their efforts to hand pick new Iraqi leaders and instead contribute to stabilizing Iraq  an effort that would directly serve their national interests  Finally  we should begin a broader effort to establish a basis for aid and even peacekeeping efforts by the international community  keyed to political progress in Iraq       In taking such steps  we must recognize that no lasting political settlement can grow out of a U S  withdrawal  On the contrary  a withdrawal must grow out of a political solution  a solution made possible by the imposition of security by coalition and Iraqi forces  Secretary Kissinger is absolutely correct when he states that    precipitate withdrawal would produce a disaster     one that    would not end the war but shift it to other areas  like Lebanon or Jordan or Saudi Arabia     produce greater violence among Iraqi factions  and embolden radical Islamists around the world       Let us keep in the front of our minds the likely consequences of premature withdrawal from Iraq  Many of my colleagues would like to believe that  should any of the various amendments forcing a withdrawal become law  it would mark the end of this long effort  They are wrong  Should the Congress force a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq  it would mark a new beginning  the start of a new  more dangerous  and more arduous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our disengagement       No matter where my colleagues came down in 2003 about the centrality of Iraq to the war on terror  there can simply be no debate that our efforts in Iraq today are critical to the wider struggle against violent Islamic extremism  Already  the terrorists are emboldened  excited that America is talking not about winning in Iraq  but is rather debating when we should lose  Last week  Ayman al Zawahiri  al Qaeda   s deputy chief  said that the United States is merely delaying our    inevitable    defeat in Iraq  and that    the Mujahideen of Islam in Iraq of the caliphate and jihad are advancing with steady steps towards victory         If we leave Iraq prematurely  jihadists around the world will interpret the withdrawal as their great victory against our great power  Their movement thrives in an atmosphere of perceived victory  we saw this in the surge of men and money flowing to al Qaeda following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan  If they defeat the United States in Iraq  they will believe that anything is possible  that history is on their side  that they really can bring their terrible rule to lands the world over  Recall the plan laid out in a letter from Zawahiri to Abu Musab al Zarqawi  before his death  That plan is to take shape in four stages  establish a caliphate in Iraq  extend the    jihad wave    to the secular countries neighboring Iraq  clash with Israel     none of which shall commence until the completion of stage one  expel the Americans from Iraq  Mr  President  the terrorists are in this war to win it  The question is  Are we      Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority would turn Iraq into a failed state and a terrorist sanctuary  in the heart of the Middle East  We have seen a failed state emerge after U S  disengagement once before  and it cost us terribly  In pre 9 11 Afghanistan  terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with impunity  We know that today there are terrorists in Iraq who are planning attacks against Americans  We cannot make this fatal mistake twice       As my friend Brent Scowcroft has said recently   The costs of staying are visible  the costs of getting out are almost never discussed      If we get out before Iraq is stable  the entire Middle East region might start to resemble Iraq today  Getting out is not a solution     Natan Sharansky has recently written     A precipitous withdrawal of U S  forces could lead to a bloodbath that would make the current carnage pale by comparison     Should we leave Iraq before there is a basic level of stability  we will invite further Iranian influence at a time when Iranian operatives are already moving weapons  training fighters  providing resources  and helping plan operations to kill American soldiers and damage our efforts to bring stability to Iraq  Iran will comfortably step into the power vacuum left by a U S  withdrawal  and such an aggrandizement of fundamentalist power has great potential to spark greater Sunni Shia conflict across the region       Leaving prematurely would induce Iraq   s neighbors  including Saudi Arabia and Jordan  Egypt to Israel  Turkey and others  to feel their own security eroding  and may well induce them to act in ways that prompt wider instability  The potential for genocide  wider war  spiraling oil prices  and the perception of strategic American defeat is real  Mr  President  and no vote on this floor will change that  This fight is about Iraq but not about Iraq alone  It is greater than that and more important still  about whether America still has the political courage to fight for victory or whether we will settle for defeat  with all of the terrible things that accompany it  We cannot walk away gracefully from defeat in this war       General Petraeus and his commanders believe that they have a strategy that can  over time  lead to success in Iraq  General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker will come to Washington in September to report on the status of their efforts  and those of the Iraqis  They ask just two things of us  the time necessary to see whether their efforts can succeed  and the political courage to support them in their work  I believe that we must give them both       I know that senators are tired of this war  tired of the mounting death toll  tired of the many mistakes we have made in this war and the great efforts it requires to reverse them  tired of the war   s politicization and the degree to which it has become embroiled in partisan struggles and election strategies  I understand this fatigue  and yet I maintain that we  as elected leaders with a duty to our people and the security of their nation  cannot let fatigue dictate our policies       The soldiers I met last week have no illusions about the sacrifices necessary to achieve their mission  On July 4th I had the great privilege to be present as 588 troops reenlisted in the military and another 161 were naturalized as U S  citizens  Those men and women  taking the oaths of enlistment and citizenship in the center of Saddam   s al Faw Palace  they understand the many hardships made in our name  They have completed tour after tour  away from their families  risking everything     everything     for the security of this country  They do so because they understand that  however great the costs of this war  the costs are immeasurably greater still if we abandon it prematurely  All they ask is that we support them in their noble mission       I wish we had planned to fight this war correctly the first time  but we can no more turn back the clock to 2003 than we can wish away the consequences of defeat by imposing some artificial deadline for withdrawal  Last week in Iraq  I met the bravest men and women our country has to offer  and not one of them told me that it was time to go  or that the cause is lost  They are frustrated with the Iraqi government   s lack of progress  They are buffeted by the winds of partisanship in Washington  talking today of surges and tomorrow of withdrawal  voting to confirm General Petraeus and then voting for a course that guarantees defeat  But in the end  they know that the war in Iraq is part of a larger struggle  a war of moderation and stability against the forces of violence and extremism  They recognize that if we simply pack up and leave  the war does not end  It merely gets harder                                                    July

 Florida    Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following remarks before a field hearing on immigrant contributions to the United States Military conducted by the Senate Armed Services Committee   I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Warner  Ranking Member Levin  and the Committee Members for holding this hearing regarding the importance of immigrants in our armed services   As everyone knows  Congress has been engaged in an immigration debate for over a year now  I would like to begin by saying that any reform that is ultimately adopted by both bodies of Congress and signed in to law by the President must address all aspects of the immigration debate  It cannot  should not  and will not be an enforcement only policy  An enforcement only strategy will not make our nation safer or more economically sound  Though our hearing today will primarily focus on one aspect of the contributions immigrants make in our society  we cannot lose sight of the fact that our nation cannot survive as a leader in this world without the lifeblood and vitality provided by immigrants  It is not enough to secure our borders and go home  We must recognize this need for immigration in our country and deal with those immigrants that are already here in a humane  fair and just way  Immigration reform is a very important and complex subject that is among the most difficult and divisive we face  And without comprehensive immigration reform  our nation s security and economy are vulnerable   Those of us from Border States witness every day the impact illegal immigration is having on our friends and neighbors  our county and city services  our economy and our environment  We deal with the degradation of our lands and the demands imposed on our hospitals and other public resources  It is a matter of life and death for many living along the border  We have hundreds of people flowing across our borders every day and an estimated 11 12 million people living in the shadows in every state in our country  Our current system doesn t protect us from people who want to harm us  It does not meet the needs of our economy  And it leaves too many people vulnerable to exploitation and abuse   Mr  Chairman  we need immigrants in this country  The current immigration system does not adequately and lawfully address this need  As long as this situation exists  without a legal path for immigrants to enter the country  we will have desperate people illegally crossing our borders and living in the shadows of our towns  cities and rural communities  That is not acceptable  particularly when we are fighting the war on terror  The vast majority of individuals attempting to cross our borders do not intend to harm our country  they are coming to meet our demand for labor and to earn money to feed their families  We have seen time and again that as long as there are jobs available in this country for people who live in poverty and hopelessness in other countries  those people will risk their lives to cross our borders    no matter how formidable the barriers    and most will be successful  By the Border Patrol s own estimates  99 percent of those apprehended coming across the border are doing so for work  However  the Border Patrol is overwhelmed by these individuals  They cannot possibly apprehend every crosser being smuggled in  no matter how many resources we provide  That is why any new immigration law must establish a legal channel for immigrants to enter the United States after they have passed background checks and have secured employment  Then we can free up federal officials to focus on those individuals intending to do harm through drug smuggling  human trafficking and terrorism   Throughout our nation s history  immigrants have proven to be hard working  ingenuitive  and prosperous  The armed services provide a unique opportunity and ability for immigrants to better their place and position  More than 20 percent of the recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor  the nation s highest decoration  have been immigrants  The creation of the submarine  the helicopter  and the ironclad ship all resulted from newcomers to our country  Additionally  during World War II  a combat team made up of the sons of Japanese immigrants was the most decorated regiment of its size  Some of our most decorated and famous serviceman  including former Secretary of State Colin Powell  are first generation Americans or immigrants themselves  At this time I would like to read a letter submitted for this hearing by Secretary Powell    Dear Chairman Warner   I am pleased to hear that the Senate Armed Services Committee will be convening a hearing regarding the contributions of immigrants to our armed services  I deeply appreciate your invitation to give testimony and regret being unable to attend  I hope you will permit me to convey my experiences as the son of immigrants and articulate both the important role immigrants  service plays in our armed forces and the need to enact comprehensive immigration reform   My parents  Luther and Maud Powell  emigrated from Jamaica in the 1920s and settled in a neighborhood in the South Bronx  New York  My father worked as a shipping clerk  my mother a seamstress  I grew up surrounded by two cultures and took pride in my immigrant roots  Upon graduating from college I took a commission in the Army and found  in that institution  opportunities to strive and succeed beyond my imagination   From the greens of Lexington and Concord to the sands of Iraq  Americans have continually answered the call to arms and successfully defended our way of life  I am proud that much of that military success can be attributed to the contributions of immigrants  The burden of defending our ideals and freedom has always been shared by those who were not yet citizens  I have witnessed time and again the bravery and valor of soldiers defending a country that they consider their adopted home  They are grateful for the opportunities the United States provides and we are grateful for their sacrifices   As President Bush has stated  our nation is in desperate need of an overhaul of our immigration laws  This must be done in a comprehensive manner to ensure that we provide the same opportunities for future immigrants as were available to my parents  While we ensure our national security and secure our boarders  we must also recognize the socially  economically  and culturally revitalizing force immigrants play in America   America s diversity is the basis for its greatness  and we are a country that prides itself on our openness to change  Those wishing to cause us harm cannot alter this fundamental American ideal  and in order to preserve it  we must continue to embrace those who come to our shores  not just those who have already benefited from the American dream   Again  thank you for the opportunity to add my voice to this important discussion   Sincerely   Colin Powell   I am hopeful that at the end of the immigration debate  we can show the American people that we addressed a serious and urgent problem with sound judgment  honesty  common sense and compassion  We must address immigration reform in a comprehensive  yes  comprehensive manner  We cannot throw money at our borders and call it a day  If all we do is attempt to secure our borders and nothing else  we will have failed the American people  I have no doubt that we will learn today of the sacrifices that many immigrants have made for their adopted home  If we do not provide the same opportunities for future immigrants that were provided for our forefathers  it is an affront to our national ideals  We owe these servicemen more for the sacrifices they have made for this great country   In closing  I urge Congress to move forward in a thoughtful  productive manner and call on both Houses to put the rhetoric and demogagory aside and sit down for meaningful discussions  It is past time to act and the American people are losing patience                                                      July 2006 Press Releases           Browse by

ACT June 13  2007 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today submitted the following statement for the Congressional Record on the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act   Mr  MCCAIN   Mr  President  as ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee I am pleased to co sponsor the  Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act   which would ensure that wounded and injured members of the Armed Forces receive the care and benefits that they deserve    We were all surprised and deeply disappointed by the conditions at Walter Reed and the problems that our wounded warriors faced after their inpatient care was complete    living in substandard conditions at Building 18  being treated poorly  battling a Cold War era disability evaluation process  and for some    simply falling through the cracks     Since February of 2007  many encouraging changes have been initiated by the Department of Defense  First and foremost  Secretary Gates established and enforced a culture of accountability for the leadership failures that lead to the tragedy at Walter Reed  Medical facilities have now been inspected by all three military departments  and improvements are underway  Additional counselors and support has been provided to families  On April 25  2007  a new Warrior Transition Brigade stood up at Walter Reed to manage all the needs of wounded and ill soldiers  both Active and Reserve  And DoD has begun to exert greater management responsibility for the disability evaluation systems of the military departments  We re on the right track to address the problems at Walter Reed and at other hospitals  We need to ensure that the effort is sustained  This legislation will ensure that these efforts continue    The legislation requires that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs work together to develop new policy to better manage the care and transition of our wounded soldiers  This policy would address many of the concerns that have been raised by wounded soldiers and their families    conditions while in a medical hold status  the need to streamline and make more transparent the medical and physical evaluation board processes  policies that facilitate the return to duty for soldiers who are able  and a policy governing the smooth transition of separating service members from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs which focuses on the needs of patients    This legislation would improve health care benefits to severely wounded soldiers by extending their health care benefits as if the member were on active duty for a period of up to five years  This approach ensures that our most severely wounded have as many health care options as possible  especially for treatment of traumatic brain injury and other long term serious conditions    This legislation authorizes additional funding for traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder and requires the establishment of two Centers of Excellence for the prevention  research and treatment on these consequences of war  This legislation would also require DoD to develop a comprehensive plan for research  prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injury  which is long overdue in addressing the so called signature injury of this war    The Administration requested  and this bill would provide  additional authorities to the Department of Defense to hire health care professionals to care for our service members and their families  It would also require the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop an electronic health record that can easily be shared between the two departments    With respect to disability determinations for wounded warriors who leave military service  this legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to establish a special review board to independently review the findings and decisions of the Physical Evaluation Boards of the military departments since 2001  in cases in which the disability rates of 20 percent or less were awarded and members were not medically retired  We must act  in light of data showing that some members    particularly junior enlisted soldiers    may have unfairly been denied medical retirement  This legislation empowers the special board to correct military records and  if appropriate  restore to a wounded soldier a higher disability rating or retired status    The bill would also end the requirement that disabled service members pay back severance pay if they obtain a higher disability rating from the VA  and increase the amount of severance pay that separating members receive    To address the need for fundamental change in the way that the DoD and VA disability evaluation systems are structured    a belief shared by many of my colleagues    this legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to immediately implement pilot projects to test new improvements to the disability evaluation system  Such pilot programs will help expedite implementation of needed changes to the disability evaluation system    This legislation would also require the Secretary of Defense to establish uniform standards for medical treatment facilities and medical residential housing facilities  and a DoD investment strategy to remedy all medical facility deficiencies   It would also require the Secretary of Defense to study the feasibility of accelerated construction of state of the art facilities and consolidation of patient care services at the new National Medical Center at Bethesda  As a condition for the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center  it would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that health care services would remain available in their totality until the new facility and staff are in place to effect a seamless transfer of care  The current facilities at Walter Reed have served the nation well    but we can and must do better    Mr  President  this legislation is a start on the journey to restore trust for America s wounded and her veterans  but it is not our final destination  It will take time to understand fully the complexities of the DoD and VA disability systems and to reconcile them in the best interests of our wounded veterans    We must also look to the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve access to care for wounded veterans and improvements in its handling of veterans claims for disabilities  We must ensure that the VA maintains a robust medical infrastructure for quality health care  teaching and research  but one that also supports veterans beyond the limits of bricks and mortar in communities throughout the nation  I am developing legislation which would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish health care access standards for veterans with a service connected disability throughout the VA health care delivery system  and  similar to DoD s TRICARE system  when services cannot be provided by the VA  authorize that care to be purchased from civilian providers  Civilian health care specialists are eager to do their part for America s veterans  Given the strain on the veterans health system  and the limits to our resources  we should give them that chance  and make certain that our nation s veterans get the care that they need  when they need it    There is no more important responsibility than to act on our moral obligation as a nation to those who are willing to give their blood for its freedom  Let us continue to be guided by the words of President George Washington in 1789  who said   the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war  no matter how justified  shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country       I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Levin and me in a bipartisan effort to make a difference in the lives of our service members who have given so much in support of our nation                                             June 2007 Press Releases           Browse by

BURMA October 10  2007 Washington  D C   U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today released the following statement about the crushing of Burma s Saffron Revolution     For years  the people of Burma have endured violence and repression at the hands of a cruel military regime  Responding again and again with prayers and peaceful resistance  the Burmese people  led by that remarkable woman Aung San Suu Kyi  show the world the real meaning of courage     And the thugs who run Burma have shown  once again  the true face of their tyranny  In crushing the Saffron Revolution  killing hundreds and jailing thousands   including countless Buddhist monks   the junta has left no doubt about its intentions  Nor should the world have any doubt about ours  We stand on the side of freedom  not fear  of peace  not violence  and of the millions in Burma who aspire to a better life  not those who would keep them isolated and oppressed     Make no mistake  the crisis is not over  Reports continue to emerge about the fate of those in detention  and today there are indications that a member of Burma s opposition party has died under interrogation by security forces  Aung San Suu Kyi remains a captive  and her National League for Democracy barred from assuming the government offices they legitimately won long ago     All those who know and admire Suu Kyi were heartbroken to see photos of her meeting last week with U N  Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari  Serene as always  Suu Kyi appeared at home  away from her people  imprisoned by a cruel  thuggish  and illegitimate regime     I had the great honor to meet Aung San Suu Kyi years ago  She is a woman of astonishing courage and incredible resolve  Her determination in the face of tyranny inspires me  and every individual who holds democracy dear     Burma s rulers fear Aung San Suu Kyi because of what she represents   peace  freedom and justice for all Burmese people  The world must now respond to the junta s actions in a way that demonstrates the inevitability of those values so clearly demonstrated by Ms  Suu Kyi     The President s recently announced banking sanctions  while welcome  are just one element of a comprehensive international response that is required in the face of the junta s crimes     Specifically  the following actions must be taken       The Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  should move beyond issuing statements and immediately convene an emergency meeting to expel Burma       The United States should work with the United Nations   but also outside the U N   and unilaterally if necessary   to impose banking sanctions that will freeze the generals  bank accounts  These sanctions should at least be as robust as the financial sanctions imposed against North Korean leader Kim Jong Il s bank accounts in Macau      The U S  should push for an immediate U N  Security Council resolution that would impose a full arms embargo on Burma       The U N  should impose a visa ban on all those in the regime who are responsible for the crackdown       The U S  should increase its broadcasting into Burma and increase its assistance  channeled through organizations like the International Republican Institute  IRI   to aid the Burmese opposition       The U S  should ban all imports of Burmese gems and teak  which are not covered under current trade restrictions and which together provide millions for the junta  Additionally  the U S  should end the exception to its sanctions for Chevron  which operates a joint gas field project       The U S  should target intelligence resources to identify those responsible for the crackdown  murders and torture of peaceful Burmese activists       The U S  should press Thailand  which has major non NATO ally status with the United States  to join with Indonesia  Malaysia and others to demand a release of all Burmese political prisoners       China must realize its central role in effect supporting the Burmese massacre  and its importance to U S  Chinese relations  particularly ahead of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing  The U S  And the world must pressure China to stop its support of the regime in Burma and to support immediate U N  action against it       We should push India to immediately suspend all military sales to Burma and cancel all of its joint training and military operations       The next phase of political life in Burma has begun  The junta s thugs cannot forever postpone the blossoming of freedom and democracy                                            October 2007 Press Releases           Browse by

BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007 September 7  2006 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today delivered the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2007  Mr  President  I rise today to address the Senate concerning the legislation before us  the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2007  This bill is particularly important in this time of ongoing war  structural changes in the force  and an aging veteran population  The Committee has worked to produce a bill that  while imperfect  addresses many of the issues that challenge our armed services and veterans  and I thank them for their work    Mr  President  America remains at war  a war that continues to unite Americans in pursuit of a common goal B to defeat terrorism  Americans have and will continue to make sacrifices for this war  Our servicemen and women in particular are truly on the front lines in this war  separated from their families  risking their lives  and working extraordinarily long hours under the most difficult conditions to accomplish the ambitious but necessary task their country has set for them    It is important that we understand the context of this years military construction legislation  Three processes are playing out simultaneously that require reasoned and appropriate Congressional action on this bill  First  Americas struggle for peace in Iraq continues  Second  our largest service  the Army  is undertaking significant structural changes and redeploying thousands of troops  Third  the recent round of Base Realignment and Closure round that streamlined the defense infrastructure is now being implemented  These three issues have defined the requirements of the legislation before us  The Committee has recognized the challenges and outlined military construction spending that  in large part  meets them    I am pleased to note that the Appropriations Committee has met the spending level requested by the Administration for the Department of Veterans Affairs  This is particularly important in light of the growing numbers of young veterans who look to the VA for care  To date more than 184 000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have sought care through the VA  Of that number  30 000 have been found to exhibit symptoms similar to post traumatic stress or PTSD  and I applaud the Committees support for PTSD programs and funding  This legislation also provides  32 7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2007  nearly equivalent to the Presidents request    I want to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies for her willingness to work with the Senate Armed Services Committee  SASC  to ensure this bill generally funds MILCON projects consistent with the authorizing committees views  The Chairman has always made a considerable effort to work with the authorizers to mitigate differences in the defense funding and authorizing bills    In particular  I appreciate the Chairmans efforts to remove an unrequested and unauthorized MILCON project for Lackland Air Force Base after I brought my concerns to her attention  That project was not requested by the Administration nor is it listed in the Air Forces Unfunded Priority List  UPL   It was added only after the Air Force Chief of Staff sought the funding outside the regular process  without the concurrence of DoD or OMB  and without any notification to or feedback from the authorizing Committees    When the authoring committees finally learned about this project  we had already completed committee markups and passed defense authorization bills in both chambers  The authorizing committees refused to add an out of scope provision into the final conference report to authorize this Air Force earmark and as such  the Chairman has since agreed to remove it from the pending bill in a mangers amendment on the Senate floor   I wanted to spend time on the Senate floor to highlight this Air Force MILCON earmark because it demonstrates how authorizers and appropriators can and should work together  While ideally the provision would never have been included in the bill since it wasnt requested  the Chairman was more than willing to listen to my concerns as an authorizer and she acted most appropriately by agreeing to remove the earmark  Again  I thank Senator Hutchison for her steadfast leadership and accommodation of the authorization committees wishes   Unfortunately  the bill before us is not entirely free of earmarks  I am concerned that  while this bill is some  434 million below the Administrations request  it nonetheless recommends almost  90 million in unrequested spending that is directed at unauthorized projects  While I recognize that many of the earmarks added to this legislation may sound worthwhile  they do not belong in the bill or its report  Needless to say  it is distressing that in this time of fiscal constraints  lawmakers continue to earmark military funds while under funding the Presidents overall request   Let me mention a few examples of money earmarked in the committee report for specific projects that were not requested by the Department of Defense   1 5 million for a General Instruction Building in Fort Lewis  Washington   1 5 million for Officers Quarters in the Ravenna  Ohio   1 5 million for a Dining Facility at Camp Roberts in San Miguel  California   3 4 million for an Aviation Readiness Center at Helena Regional Airport  Montana   1 4 million for an Engine Shop in Fort Worth  Texas   900 000 for an Information Technology Complex at Wright Patterson AFB  Ohio   2 0 million for a Regional Training Institute in West Virginia   Almost all the earmarked money will go to the states represented by members of the Committee  These examples  Mr  President  are only part of the nearly  60 million in unrequested earmarks that siphon funds away from important programs needed for enhancing our war fighting capability  This means  Mr  President  that the armed services have come to us with urgent needs and we have responded by giving them less than what they asked for while requiring that they spend it to suit our parochial needs rather than military necessity    The problems facing our active and retired veterans  whether in the form of force structure or modernization or enhancing quality of life benefits  are properly addressed in a deliberative budget process  However  we should think twice before diverting money away from military necessities to fund home state projects  The American taxpayer expects more of us  as do our brave servicemen and women who are fighting this war on global terrorism on our behalf   I yield the floor    list attached below                                    Related Files               9706MilitaryConstructionAppropsFY07PorkList pdf

PETRAEUS AND AMBASSADOR CROCKER McCain  The choices we make now    will affect the security of all countrymen for decades to come  September 11  2007 WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today spoke at the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  The following remarks were prepared for delivery  Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and welcome to our two distinguished witnesses  With your testimony  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  a debate of historic proportions begins in the United States Congress  The choices we make now  whether to build on the success of the surge and fight for additional gains  or whether to set a date for American surrender in   Iraq  will affect the security of all our countrymen for decades to come  As we all know  the American people are saddened  frustrated  and angry over our past failures in   Iraq   I  too  have been made sick at heart by the terrible price we have paid for nearly four years of mismanaged war  Some of us from the beginning warned against the Rumsfeld strategy of too few troops  insufficient resources  and a plan predicated on hope rather than on the difficult business of stabilization and counterinsurgency  We lost years to that strategy  and we lost that which is most precious to us  the lives of the brave men and women who fight on our behalf  But the question today is not whether we can recover those four years  we cannot  but whether we end this effort in frustration and accept thereby the terrible consequences that will ensue  I believe we cannot choose to lose in Iraq  and I will fight to ensure that our commanders in   Iraq have the time and support they request to win this war  The distinguished strategist Ralph Peters summed up the state of affairs well in a column today  noting that Congress failure to support General Petraeus would be a shame  since  after nearly four years of getting it miserably wrong in Iraq  were finally getting it right  We are getting it right because we finally have in place a strategy that can succeed  a counterinsurgency strategy  which some of us have argued we should have been following from the beginning  and which makes the most effective use of our strength and does not strengthen the tactics of our enemy  We must  as General Petraeus intends  keep this strategy in place  it is the only approach that has resulted in real security improvements in   Iraq  Anyone who has traveled recently to Anbar  or to Diyala  or Yusufiya  or to   Baghdad can see the improvements that have taken place over the past months  As our witnesses will testify  violence is down  commerce is on the rise  and the bottom up efforts to forge counterterrorism alliances are bearing tangible fruit  There are many challenges remaining  and the road ahead is long and tough  The Maliki government has not seized the opportunity presented by our efforts to move ahead with reconciliation and is not functioning as it must  Violence  having declined significantly  remains high and  as Ambassador Crocker has noted  no one can be certain of success  We can be sure  however  that should the United States Congress succeed in legislating a date for withdrawal  and thus surrender  then we will fail for certain  Make no mistake  the consequences of American defeat in   Iraq will be terrible and long lasting  There is in some corners a belief that we can simply turn the page in   Iraq   come home  and move on to other things  This is dangerously wrong  If we surrender in Iraq  we will be back  in   Iraq and elsewhere  in many more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even greater cost in American lives and treasure  Last week  General Jim Jones testified before this committee and outlined what he believes to be the consequences of such a course        a precipitous departure which results in a failed state in Iraq  he said  will have a significant boost in the numbers of extremists  jihadists       in the world  who will believe that they will have toppled the major power on Earth and that all else is possible  And I think it will not only make us less safe  it will make our friends and allies less safe  And the struggle will continue  It will simply be done in different and in other areas  Some senators would like to withdraw our troops from   Iraq so we can get back to fighting what they believe to be the real war on terror  which is taking place somewhere else  This  too  is inaccurate  Iraq has become the central front in the global war on terror  and failure there would turn Iraq into a terrorist sanctuary  in the heart of the Middle East  a host for jihadists planning attacks on   America   The region could easily descend into chaos  wider war  and genocide  and we should have no doubt about who will take advantage  The Iranian president has stated his intentions bluntly  saying  Soon  we will see a huge power vacuum in the region  Of course  we are prepared to fill the gap  We cannot allow an Iranian dominated    Middle East to take shape in the context of wider war and terrorist safehavens  All of us want our troops to come home  but we should want them to return to us with honor  the honor of victory that is due all of those who have paid with the ultimate sacrifice  General Petraeus and his troops ask just two things of us  the time to continue this strategy and the support they need to carry out their mission  They must have both  and I will fight to ensure that they do  Soon this debate will move from hearing rooms to the Senate floor where we will see  again  attempts to legislate a withdrawal from   Iraq   Given the enormous human and strategic costs such a defeat would impose on Iraq  the region  and Americans for years to come  Congress must not choose to lose in   Iraq   I will do all in my power to ensure that we do not  Thank you                                            September 2007 Press Releases           Browse by

6  2006 Washington D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today introduced the Stop the Online Exploitation of Our Children Act and submitted the following remarks regarding his legislation for the record    Mr  President  today I am introducing the Stop the Online Exploitation of Our Children Act of 2006  This legislation would reduce the sexual exploitation of our children  and punish those who cause them physical and emotional harm through sex crimes    Twenty two years ago  President Ronald Reagan inaugurated the opening of the  National Center  for Missing and Exploited Children  known as NCMEC  At a White House ceremony  he called on the Center to wake up America and attack the crisis of child victimization  Today  thanks to the efforts of NCMEC and many others in the public and private sectors  America is more conscious of the dangers of child exploitation  but our children still face significant threats from those who see their innocence as an opportunity to do harm  The continuing victimization of our children is readily and all too painfully apparent in the resurgence of child pornography in our world    In recent years  technology has contributed to the greater distribution and availability  and  some believe  desire for child pornography  I say child pornography  but that label does not describe accurately what is at issue  As emphasized by a recent Department of Justice report  child pornography does not come close to describing these images  which are nothing short of recorded images of child sexual abuse  These images are  quite literally  digital evidence of violent sexual crimes perpetrated against the most vulnerable among us    Mr  President  experts are also finding that the images of child sexual exploitation produced and distributed today involve younger and younger children  As emphasized by NCMEC  83 percent of offenders surveyed in a recent study were caught with images of children younger than 12 years old  Thirty nine percent had images of children younger than six  Almost 20 percent had images of children younger than three  These are not normal criminals  and I cannot fathom the extent of the physical and emotional harm they cause their victims    The violence of the images continues to increase as well  Dr  Sharon Cooper  a nationally recognized expert on this subject  stated before a September Senate Commerce Committee hearing that the images often depict sadistic gross sexual assault and sodomy  This view was underscored by Mike Brown  the Sheriff of Bedford County  Virginia  and the Director of the Blue Ridge Thunder Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force  who also testified to his direct experience with increasingly violent and disturbing images of child sexual exploitation    The Federal government has in place a system for online companies such as Internet service providers to report these images to NCMEC  The Center is directed by law to relay that information to Federal and State law enforcement agencies  This reporting system has been successful  but it is in need of several vital improvements   The bill would enhance the current reporting system by expanding the range of companies obligated to report child pornography to NCMEC  stating specifically what information must be reported to the Center  moving the reporting obligations into the Federal criminal code  imposing higher penalties on companies that do not report child pornography to NCMEC in the manner required by law  and providing greater legal certainty around the child pornography reporting requirement    As suggested by NCMEC  the reporting of child pornography should be more widespread  To that end  the bill would expand and clarify the types of online companies that would be obligated to report child pornography to the Center  Today  Federal law requires electronic communication service providers and providers of remote computing services to report child pornography they discover to NCMEC through the Centers CyberTipline  However  what types of companies fall into each category is sometimes unclear  To better define and expand the types of online companies obligated to report child pornography  the legislation would require a broad range of online service providers  including web hosting companies  domain name registrars  and social networking sites  to report child pornography to NCMEC    Another weakness in the current reporting system is that the law does not say exactly what information should be reported to NCMEC  This failure to set forth specific reporting requirements makes the current statute both difficult to comply with and tough to enforce  and this omission may have led to less effective prosecution of child pornographers  According to testimony submitted by the Center to the Senate Commerce Committee  because there are no guidelines for the contents of these reports  some  companies  do not send customer information that allows NCMEC to identify a law enforcement jurisdiction  So potentially valuable investigative leads are left to sit in the CyberTipline database with no action taken  This is unacceptable  Mr  President  The bill would cure this problem by requiring that reporting companies convey to the Center a defined set of information  which is in large part the information that is provided to NCMEC today by the nations leading Internet service providers  Among other things  the bill would require online service providers to report specific information about the individual involved in producing  distributing  or receiving child pornography such as that individuals e mail address  In addition  it would require reporting companies to NCMEC geographic location of the involved individual such as the individuals physical address and the IP address from which the individual connected to the Internet   Mr  President  to ensure that law enforcement officials have better odds of prosecuting involved individuals  the bill would also require online service providers to preserve all data that they report to NCMEC for at least 180 days  and to not knowingly destroy any other information that they posses that relates to a child pornography incident reported to NCMEC    The legislation would help ensure greater compliance with the child pornography reporting requirements under Federal law by increasing three fold the penalties for knowing failure to report child pornography to NCMEC  It would also move the reporting requirement from title 42  which relates to the publics health and welfare  to title 18  our Federal criminal code  This is to underscore that a breach of the reporting obligations is a violation of criminal law  In addition  the Act would eliminate the legal liability of online service providers for actions taken to comply with the child pornography reporting requirements    The bottom line  Mr  President  is that this legislation should result in more thorough reporting of child pornography to NCMEC  I expect that more and better information provided to the Center will lead to a greater number of prosecutions and enhanced protection of our children  As stated by NCMEC  with improvements to the reporting system there would be more reports that are actionable by law enforcement  which will lead to more prosecutions and convictions and  more importantly  to the rescue of more children    In addition to the provisions relating to child pornography  the bill also would ensure that sex offenders will register information relevant to their online activities on sex offender registries  Specifically  it would require sex offenders to register their email addresses  as well as their instant messaging and chat room handles and any other online identifiers they use  If a sex offender failed to do so  he could be prosecuted  convicted  and thrown into jail for up to 10 years  The bill would also make the use of the Internet in the commission of a crime of child exploitation an aggravating factor that would add 10 years to the offenders sentence    Mr  President  to help address the international nature of child pornography  the bill would permit NCMEC to share reports with foreign law enforcement agencies  subject to approval by the Department of Justice  In addition  the Act would state the sense of Congress that the executive branch should make child pornography a priority when engaging in negotiations or talks with foreign countries    Finally  the Act would authorize  20 3 million for our Nations Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces  This increase of  5 million above that currently requested by the Administration is recommended by NCMEC  Sheriff Brown  and others who believe that the additional amount would significantly improve the efforts of these teams of Federal  State  and local law enforcement officials dedicated to identifying and prosecuting those who use the Internet to prey upon our Nations children    Mr  President  protecting our children is a top priority for members of Congress  regardless of party affiliation  This legislation would help us achieve that goal  I look forward to working with my colleagues to debate and move this bill through the legislative process during the next Congress                                                         December 2006 Press Releases           Browse

Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  introduced the Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment  CHOICE  Act of 2006  The bill is designed to encourage broadcasters and cable companies that own cable channels to sell their channels individually to subscribers  It also promotes cable channel distribution over the Internet   Below is Senator McCain s floor statement that was submitted for the record today  the bill summary  and a copy of the of the opinion editorial by Senator McCain and FCC Chairman Martin as it appeared in the Los Angeles Times on May 25  2006  Attached is a copy of the legislation            STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CONSUMERS HAVING OPTIONS IN CABLE ENTERTAINMENT  CHOICE  ACT OF 2006  June 7  2006  MR  MCCAIN  Mr  President  today I am introducing the Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment  CHOICE  Act of 2006  This bill would encourage broadcasters and cable companies that own cable channels to sell their channels individually to subscribers  It would also promote cable programming distribution over the Internet   For almost ten years I have supported giving consumers the ability to buy cable channels individually  also known as a la carte  to provide consumers with more control over the viewing options in their home and their monthly cable bill  Cable companies have resisted this and have continued to give consumers all the  choice  of a North Korean election ballot  There is only one option available  buy a package of channels  whether you watch all the channels or not  The alternative is to not receive cable programming at all  Why have cable companies and cable programmers refused to give consumers the ability to buy and pay for only those channels consumers watch  Simply because they do not have to  They are the only game in town  But not for long  I hope   Telephone companies have realized that consumers want more and are poised to provide consumers across the nation with an alternative to the local cable company  Many of these telephone companies  including ATT  are also ready to offer consumers the ability to purchase channels a la carte  Such companies will offer two crucial benefits to consumers  more competition in the video service provider market  and more options for programming packages  Together  these two offerings will allow consumers to have greater control over the content that enters the home and the ability to manage their monthly cable bills   According to a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report  in communities where there are two cable companies competing for customers  cable rates are 15 percent less than in communities without any competition  A subsequent GAO study suggests that in some markets the presence of another cable competitor may reduce rates by an astounding 41 percent  Unfortunately  today less then five percent of communities have two companies competing to provide consumers cable television service   The CHOICE Act would help bring competition to the cable television market  Choice in cable television delivery is long overdue for consumers who have suffered steep rate hikes year after year  Since 1996  cable rates have increased 58 percent or nearly three times the rate of inflation  The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  has found that rates increased seven percent in 2001 and 2002  and five percent in 2003  The FCC s most recent report found that rates again rose five percent in 2004  double the rate of inflation  but only 3 6  where the local cable company faced competition  I can only imagine the savings consumers could reap if presented with a choice of providers of cable service and a choice of channels  For this reason I call on Congress to pass the CHOICE Act   A recent USA Today Gallup poll found that a majority of Americans would like to buy cable channels individually and an AP  Ipsos poll found that a remarkable 78 percent of Americans would like to do so  According to Nielsen Media Research  households receiving more than 70 channels only watch  on average  about 17 of these  Consumers know that they could have greater control over their monthly bill if given the ability to choose their channels  This was recently confirmed by the FCC  This year the FCC found that consumers could save as much as 13 percent on their monthly cable bills if they could buy only the channels they want   Mr  President  consider the situation of a senior citizen on fixed income living in Sun City  Arizona  who watches only a few news and movie channels  but continues to pay for high priced channels such as ESPN  Fox Sports  and MTV   channels that other consumers enjoy  but channels that certain seniors may not want and possibly cannot afford  In fact  the general manager of the Sun City cable system has told my staff that he has tried to drop several expensive music video channels from the company s channel lineup to make room for channels his viewers want to receive and to decrease costs  but the owners of the music video channels have forbid him to do so without serious repercussions  So the residents of Sun City continue to subsidize the cost of these channels for viewers around the country  That is why AARP  representing 35 million senior citizens  supports the ability for viewers to buy channels on an a la carte basis  But again  cable companies don t have to listen to these 35 million viewers because there is no real threat of losing them  They have nowhere to turn   The CHOICE ACT  Mr  President  is not a mandate on cable providers  Instead it is designed to encourage choice and competition by granting significant regulatory relief to video service providers  such as telephone and cable companies  that agree to both offer cable channels on an a la carte basis to subscribers and to not prohibit any channel owned by the video service provider from being sold individually  In exchange  video service providers would receive the right to obtain a national franchise  would be permitted to pay lower fees to municipalities for the use of public rights of way  would benefit from a streamlined definition of  gross video revenue  for the calculation of such fees  and would gain a prohibition on the solicitation of institutional networks  in kind donation  and unlimited public access channels   In addition  broadcasters that have an ownership stake in a cable channel would get the benefit of the FCC s network non duplications rule if the broadcaster does not prohibit the channel from being sold individually  The FCC s network non duplication rule provides exclusivity for broadcasters by not allowing another broadcaster with the same network affiliation from broadcasting in the same community  The bill would also modify Section 616 a  of the Communications Act that currently prohibits video service providers from using coercion or retaliatory tactics to prevent cable channels from making their services available to competing companies to extend this provision to distribution over the Internet   For example  if Time Warner Cable offered CNN  a cable channel it owns  on an a la carte basis to its cable subscribers and allowed other cable companies  satellite companies  and video programmers who choose to distribute CNN to make it available on an a la carte basis  Time Warner Cable would be eligible for a national franchise and other regulatory relief  If Disney  which owns ESPN  allowed other cable companies  satellite companies  and video programmers who choose to distribute ESPN to make it available on an a la carte basis  the Disney s ABC broadcast stations would have the benefit of the FCC s network non duplication rule   Mr  President  contrary to what some might want the American people to believe  the CHOICE Act does not force video service providers or broadcasters to do a single thing  It is their choice whether to act or not act  The bill provides them with such a choice even though they currently don t provide meaningful choices to their customers  This bill is incentive based legislation that would encourage owners of cable channels to make channels available for individual purchase and would do nothing to prevent cable companies from continuing to offer a bundle of channels or tiers of channels   The cable industry regularly touts the value of its package of channels  noting that it costs less than taking a family of four to a movie or professional sporting event  However  watching cable television is not always a family event  Several channels have programming that consumers find objectionable or that parents believe is unsuitable for young children  Complaints about indecent cable programming have increased exponentially in recent years  In 2004  the FCC received 700 percent more cable indecency complaints than it received in 2003  Most of the cable programs about which indecency complaints have been filed with the FCC aired during hours when many children are watching television   Cable and satellite companies currently provide subscribers with a variety of methods of blocking the audio and video programming of any channel that they do not wish to receive  However  subscribers are still required to pay for these channels that they find objectionable  The  v chip  does not effectively protect children from indecent programming carried by video programming distributors  Most of the television sets currently in use in the United States are not equipped with a v chip  of the 280 million sets currently in United States households  approximately 161 million television sets are not equipped with a v chip  Households that have a television set with a v chip are also likely to have one or more sets that are not equipped with a v chip   Again  Mr  President  I am aware that not all consumers want to block and not pay for certain channels  but shouldn t all consumers should have the choice to do so  Cable programmers and broadcasters have started offering individual television programs for download on the Internet  This is the purest form of a la carte   where one can watch and pay for only specific programs they choose  In addition  many of these same broadcasters and cable programmers make their channels available for individual purchase in Hong Kong  Canada  and other countries  Why do these cable programmers treat the American cable subscriber differently than a subscriber in Hong Kong or Canada or an Internet user  It remains unclear   Lastly  Mr  President  I know that the cable programmers and broadcasters will not be the only group that may have some concerns with this bill  Many of my friends in local government are also likely to be interested in the reduced  rights of way  fee and streamlined definition of  gross video revenue  under this bill  Cable companies pay these fees to municipalities to use the right of way land under sidewalks  streets and bridges to reach customers  homes and then pass these fees on to subscribers  However  these fees often surpass the costs of managing  rights of way  land and municipalities use these funds for other expenditures  Just last month at a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee  Michael A  Guido  Mayor of Dearborn  Michigan  confirmed that these fees are often used to pay for other city expenses  such as emergency vehicles   In 2004  state and local governments collected approximately  2 4 billion in these fees  slightly more than  37 per year from every household subscriber  Americans for Tax Reform believes that the  franchise fee is just a stealth tax on our consumption of the cable television   as do other economists and tax payer advocacy groups  To this end  the legislature in my home state of Arizona just recently passed a bill to reduce such fees and taxes on cable television subscribers   The Phoenix Center  a non partisan legal and economic think tank  has found that the introduction of competition to cable companies could allow the fee to be lowered  significantly without doing any harm to local governments   Based upon this research  the CHOICE Act would reduce the fee from 5 percent to 3 7 percent for eligible video service providers and allow local governments to petition the FCC for a higher fee if it is necessary to cover the costs of managing  rights of way  land  I believe this would provide some real cost savings to cable subscribers   I remain open to working with municipalities on this issue and look forward to working with all interested parties to ensure that American consumers receive greater options for affordable and acceptable television viewing  Mr  President  I hope the introduction of the CHOICE Act furthers the debate on the issue of a la carte channel selection and I look forward to the Senate s consideration of the bill    Summary   The CHOICE Act   Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act   This bill would grant significant regulatory relief to video service providers who agree to both offer cable channels on an a la carte basis to subscribers and not prohibit any channel owned by the video service provider from being sold individually   In exchange for offering consumers cable channels on an a la carte basis  video service providers would receive the right to obtain a national franchise  would be permitted to pay lower fees to municipalities for the use of public rights of way  would benefit from a streamlined definition of  gross video revenue  for the calculation of such fees  and would gain a prohibition on the solicitation of institutional networks  in kind donation  and unlimited PEG channels   Broadcasters with an ownership stake in a cable channel would get the benefit of the FCC s network non duplication rule if the broadcaster does not prohibit the channel from being sold individually  Lastly  the bill would extend Section 616 a  of the Communications Act to extend this provision to distribution over the Internet   Below is a more detailed summary of the bill   Section One  Sets forth the title of the bill   Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act    Section Two  Defines the terms  a la carte    video service    video service provider  and  eligible video service provider    o A  video service provider  is defined as a provider of video services that uses a public right of way  This definition would cover all wired providers  including cable companies and telephone companies such as Comcast  Cox  Verizon  and ATT  This definition would not apply to direct broadcast satellite  DBS  providers such as Dish Network and DirecTV who are not required to seek a franchise under current law   o An  eligible video service provider  is defined as    1  a video service provider that  i  has an attributable interest in a cable channel offered on the basic tier of a digital cable system   ii  makes available that cable channel available to its subscribers individually   iii  does not prohibit other providers from offering this channel individually and  iv  files with the FCC a declaration of its intent to offer its subscribers on an individual basis any cable channel provided to it on an individual basis   OR   2  a video service provider that does not have an attributable interest in a cable channel and files with the FCC a declaration of its intent to offer its subscribers on an individual basis any cable channel provided to it on an individual basis    Section Three  Sets forth the regulatory relief for Eligible Video Service Providers   o Dissolution of a local franchise  in favor of a national franchise   o Termination of a  franchise fee  set at 5  of gross revenues in favor of a  rights of way fee  set at 3 7  of  gross video revenues    o Prohibition on in kind contributions or institutional networks  unless such donations are credited against the calculation of  gross video revenues    o Streamlining of definition of  gross video revenues  from current statutory definition of  gross revenues    o Establishment of a dispute resolution process for disputes regarding the use of a municipalities   rights of way    o Modification of FCC s rules on  public  educational  or governmental   PEG  channels to require video service providers to make available at least three PEG channels and to necessitate municipalities who program PEG channels to provide at least eight hours of programming a day with four hours of non repeat programming  and   o Establishes an effective date of six months after enactment   Section Four  This section states that broadcasters with an ownership stake in a cable channel would get the benefit of the FCC s network non duplication rule only if the broadcaster permits the cable channel to be sold individually  The FCC s network non duplication rule states that upon the request of a local television station with exclusive rights to distribute a network or syndicated program  a cable operator generally may not carry a duplicating program broadcast by a distant station  The Commission s rules generally provide stations such protection within a station s 35 mile geographic zone   Section Five  Amends Section 616 a  of the Communications Act that currently prohibits video service providers from using coercion to prevent cable channels from making their services available to competing companies to extend the prohibition to other distribution systems  including the Internet   Section Six  This section states that the FCC has the authority to prescribe any rules and regulations to carry out the CHOICE Act   Section Seven  Sets forth a severability clause     Los Angeles Times  May 25  2006 Thursday  Home Edition  SECTION  CALIFORNIA  Metro  Editorial Pages Desk  Part B  Pg  11  LENGTH  624 words  HEADLINE  TV served a la carte  BYLINE  John McCain and Kevin Martin  SEN  JOHN MCCAIN  R Ariz   is introducing the CHOICE Act  KEVIN MARTIN is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission   BODY   AMERICAN consumers have little choice when it comes to cable television  If you want ESPN  you must pay for 60 plus channels that you may never watch  If your child loves Nickelodeon  your family must pay for the same 60 plus channels  some of which may not be suitable for young children  Now  imagine deciding for yourself which TV channels you want to purchase  You could select the channels you want to pay for  and opt out of those you don t  In fact  right now millions of TV viewers outside the U S  have these choices  They buy their television channels individually or in smaller bundles    and get better deals as a result   Why can t Americans do this now  Because there is too little competition  too much regulation and not enough consumer choice in the cable TV business  As a result  in just the last two years alone cable prices have increased at twice the rate of inflation    and more than 90  since 1995  Cable companies explain away their skyrocketing prices by saying they are giving you more and more channels  At no time  however  have the cable companies actually asked if you want those additional channels  You have to pay for them whether you want them or not   The solution to high cable bills isn t price controls or additional government regulation  It is more competition and more choice  For that reason  Congress should pass the proposed Consumers Having Options in Cable Entertainment Act    the CHOICE Act    which is being introduced today  It would allow cable companies to compete nationally for your business  rather than only at the local level  in exchange for agreeing to offer channels a la carte  either individually or in smaller bundles   The Government Accountability Office has found that cable rates are 15  lower when a community has at least two companies competing for consumers  The Federal Communications Commission found that consumers could lower their monthly cable bill by as much as 13  if they had a la carte programming options   And parents would never be forced to purchase a slew of channels  some not suitable for young children  simply to receive those channels that their family enjoys watching together   Real world examples illustrate the benefits of greater choice and more competition coming through our TV sets  In Hong Kong  viewers can select and pay for only the channels they want  A family that wants to watch sports  movies  news and children s programming can receive 15 free channels plus a selection of 11 additional digital channels  including ESPN  HBO  CNN Headline News  National Geographic Channel  Animal Planet and Discovery Channel  for only  27 50 a month  To get a package that includes those channels in Washington  the cost is  82 per month    almost  1 000 a year  That s quite a difference   Similarly  in Canada  digital subscribers can buy channels individually or enjoy significant savings on a 5 pack  a 10 pack or a 15 pack of their own choosing   Interestingly  the same companies that oppose selling channels individually or in smaller packages in the U S  offer their programming a la carte in other countries  Their threats of financial ruin and a loss of diverse programming have proved hollow  American consumers want these companies to offer such choices  According to a recent AP Ipsos poll  78  of respondents said they would prefer to choose and pay for their own tailored selection of channels   Today  cable choice and competition have been successful around the world  Consumers in Hong Kong  Britain  India and Canada are reaping the rewards of greater choice from channels being offered on an a la carte basis  So why not increase competition in the U S  and at the same time make sure that companies offer us true choice in cable programming                                              June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by

STAFF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY February 8  2007 Washington  D C     Senator John McCain  R AZ  today  made the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding General Casey s Nomination for Chief of Staff of the United States Army  Mr  President  I come again this morning in not a particularly pleasant task of opposing the nomination of General Casey to be Chief of Staff of the United States Army  And I again preface my remarks with my appreciation for his honorable service to the country  his family  and the sacrifices that they have made for many  many years  And this isn   t a question of character  because his character is outstanding  It   s a question of judgment    Now  Mr  President  I try to put this in the context of why I   m in opposition  For several years I and a number of others have bemoaned and complained and criticized and been saddened as we   ve watched this train wreck in Iraq  Not long after the initial invasion  I came back from a visit to Iraq and visited with the then Secretary of Defense who bears great responsibility for this debacle  and history will judge him very  very badly for his performance as Secretary of Defense  and told him how imperative it was that we were not going to win  we were not going to succeed  that we didn   t have enough troops over there  that Anbar province was going to erupt and basically all the things many of us thought were going to transpire    Now  General Casey  for two and a half years  up until recently would come back to the Congress and say that things were going well  I quoted many quotes yesterday from time to time  including the 2005 one saying we could start withdrawing by 2006  and on and on  completely divorced from reality on the ground  Completely divorced  as was the Secretary of Defense  And I will state at the beginning Presidents are responsible  Presidents are responsible  But Presidents also rely on the advice and counsel of their military leaders  That   s just a normal thing to happen and has happened in every conflict  And President Bush said time and time again   I   ve said to the American people as Iraqis stand up  we   ll stand down  But I also said our commanders on the ground will make that decision  And I will talk to General Casey   On and on    The Army   s getting on its feet  We turned over a lot of territory to the army  They   re good fighters  I spent a great deal of time with General Casey there in Washington  They are generals who will happy to hear  tell me the way it is  not the way I think it would like to be  Time after time it appears the President of the United States  as appropriate  has been relying on the advice and counsel of the commanders in the field  who did not give him appropriate information or recommendations  in my view  We are all responsible  In the military you are responsible for the decisions that you make on the battlefield  particularly when they cost our money valuable and important asset  That   s American blood    In his opening statement at the Senate Armed Services Committed on September 29 he said the capacity of Iraqi forces has increased over the past year and we have developed a readiness system not unlike the one we have in place for our own forces  Over the past 18 months we have built enough Iraqi capacity where we can begin talking seriously about transitioning this counterinsurgency mission to them  Did he realize at the time the statement was wrong  And when did he tell someone  At the same hearing General Casey said more coalition is not necessarily better  More and more capable Iraqi security forces are better  Increased coalition presence speeds the notion of occupation  It contributes to the dependence of Iraqi security forces on the coalition    It extends the amount of time it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant and exposes more coalition forces to attacks at a time when Iraqi security forces are increasingly available and increasingly capable  There has been no sign of that  Mr  President  Why did it take 15 months for General Casey to change that assessment and then not even agree that the new strategy of five additional brigades  which most of us pray is enough and most of us believe is a direct contravention to the Powell Doctrine which is use overwhelming force in order to gain militarily   President Bush said General Casey will make decisions as to how many troops we have there  Why did it take two and a half years  no audio   didn t have enough troops there  And the situation is worsening in Iraq  The N I E  that came out yesterday should frighten anyone  any American because of the stark depiction in the NIE public document  That states that the situation is grave and deteriorating in Iraq  which is also the conclusions of the Iraq Study Group  whether you happen to agree with their recommendations or not  Mr  President  responsibility is one of the first things that   s taught at our service academies  We are responsible for our decisions  When the Missouri runs aground  where do we leave the captain  we relieve the captain  Now what we   re doing is we   re rewarding failure  just as we did during the Vietnam War  We named General Wes Moreland as Chief of Staff of the Army after a failed search and destroy  There are some parallels here  General Wes Moreland employed the search and destroy strategy  The counterinsurgency strategy is clear and hold and build  That   s not what has been done in the past under General Casey  So  what are we doing   We are promoting a general who has pursued a failed policy  advocated it to the President of the United States  whom he is responsible to advising  advocating it to the Congress of the United States  despite the overwhelming view by many of us that was not a successful strategy  And still today  where he will be in place if he is confirmed by the United States Senate  responsible for the operations  the training and the doctrine that will be employed in Iraq  And he still to this day  as far as I know  as far as a hearing a short time ago  believes  and I could give the quote  that we are not failing  that we are succeeding  I don   t know of anyone who believes that that   s in a responsible position in government    So  Mr  President  it is with a bit of regret I do this  Again  I would repeat what I said yesterday  Senator Levin asked him   I   m wondering whether you would agree that what we   re doing in Iraq was    maybe a slow failure      General Casey   I didn   t  I actually don   t see it as a slow failure  I actually see it as slow progress     How could you depict the situation in Baghdad today with six H L cop terse being shot down in the last few weeks  with a spike in casualties that has taken place and the continued level of sectarian violence that it   s a slow progress    So  I want to tell my friends that people in the military  particularly our young officers  are watching what we do here  We teach them  we teach them in our service schools and we teach our noncommissioned officers and our junior officers  you   re responsible  You   re responsible for success or failure  That   s why we appoint you as leaders  And in case  this leader  despite his honorable character and his dedication ton this country  has not led and his responsibility has not been carried out    So  Mr  President  I hope that my colleagues will turn down this nomination and that we will appoint one of the many  Many highly qualified military  senior military officers that we have to fulfill this position  May I just finally  say Mr  President  I   m very nervous about the new strategy  I   m not sure     in fact  I   m very doubtful we have enough troops  I don   t know if the Maliki government will be strong enough  But if General Casey is appointed to this position  my confidence will be lowered because it   s not appropriate to put someone who does not support wholeheartedly the new strategy in the position where he will be responsible for a great deal of it  And to this day doesn   t admit that this policy has  present strategy has failed  Mr  President  do I have any time remaining     I thank you  Mr  President  And let me just make it clear  I don   t support medals for failure  I don   t support promotion to higher position for failure  I believe that the awards and accolades that Senator Levin alluded to that been provided to those who have committed egregious failures was not only inappropriate  it was absolutely insulting   And I also  though  would point out that history will judge many of these people who have been give medals of various types and already that judgment has been harsh  All of us are more concerned about our place in history that we are medals  History and the American people are already judging the failures and the misleading statements like stuff happens and mission accomplished and few dead enders and last throes and all of those statements that have been made over the past 3    years which led the American people to believe that we were succeeding in Iraq when many of us knew we weren   t  We violated a fundamental principle called the Powell Doctrine  that if you want to win  you go in with overwhelming force  And the reason why I   m very concerned today  even though we have a very outstanding general in Petraeus  the fact is that I   m not sure that we have enough troops still    Mr  President  throughout our history  military commanders have been held responsible  Abraham Lincoln held General McClellan responsible and fired him in World War II  those who were in command that were responsible for December 7  1941  were held responsible  In the Korean War  General McArthur was held responsible  The fact is that military leaders are held responsible as well as civilian leaders  And Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent to have put in the record the number of times President Bush said that he relied on the judgment of the military commanders  Those military commanders did not exercise good judgment and  inaccurate depiction of facts on the ground in Iraq as they came before our committee  the Armed Services Committee  and spoke to the President of the United States and the American people    Mr  President  in 2004  General Casey said   My view of winning is that are broadly on track to accomplishing our objectives  With Iraq security forces capable of maintaining domestic order and denying Iraqis a safe haven for terror  I believe we   re on track to get there by September of 2005  We have a strategy and plan for success in Iraq  We   re broadly on track in achieving our goals    Time after time  the American people were told that things were going fine  and they were not  I want to emphasize again  Mr  President  I believe that General Casey has served this nation honorably  I think his family and he have made great sacrifices for this country  I have nothing but respect  But to reward failure is going to send a message all around the military that I don   t think is a healthy one  And I don   t support promotion  I don   t support medals for failure  I support people being held responsible  and I regret that those who have been responsible for it honestly inside have not been held more responsible  Although as we speak today  the American people  by their opinions as reflected in the polls  are certainly reflecting their judgment able the performance and the responsibility of our civilian leaders  Mr  President  I hope that we can move forward and obtain success in Iraq under this new strategy  I   m not sure right now that General Casey completely supports it  And I don   t think that it enhances our chance for succeeding in Iraq  I urge my colleagues to vote                                             February 2007 Press Releases           Browse by

EARMARKS H R  2862  Departments of Commerce and Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill  2006 September 14  2005 Washington  D C   Senator McCain  R AZ  spoke on the floor of the United States Senate today  Follows are his remarks  Mr  President  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration   I thank the clerk for reading the amendment in its entirety for the benefit of my colleagues   As you have just heard  this Sense of the Senate amendment is fairly simple  It is an attempt to reign in wasteful spending  particularly during this time when portions of our country along the Gulf are enduring the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina  indeed a national tragedy   Mr  President  as our Nation continues to manage the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  it is imperative that Congress do what it can  what it must  to help the hundreds of thousands of victims of one of the worst natural disasters in our history  Congress must do all that is necessary to fund essential relief and recovery efforts and help those in need   The costs of the recovery and relief effort will be enormous  and it should go without saying that we live in times of great need and limited resources  In these times Americans are called to sacrifice  and Congress needs to make sacrifices of its own  To the extent that it is possible  we should pay for this effort now rather than pass on even more debt to future generations  We should also make better use of taxpayers money by eliminating our spending on matters of questionable merit or nonessential in order to better assist the victims of Katrina   These are times when members of Congress need to deny themselves a few of the comforts of political office and refrain from directing tax dollars to special projects in their States  These projects might help political campaigns but they do not necessarily benefit the country as a whole  Regrettably  as far back as I can recall  Congress has found a way to fund thousands of unauthorized projects of questionable merit  Perhaps some of those dollars would have been better spent on activities that might have limited the impact of this tragedy   Mr  President  this years Commerce and Justice  Science  and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill  H R  2862  is relatively restrained compared to recent bills that have moved through the Senate  the highway bill comes to mind  Still  the legislation contains several examples of the types of provisions that magically appear in too many of the appropriations bills that benefit parochial interests with little regard to the merits at the expense of national priorities   For example  H R  2862 contains several earmarks that fund initiatives that some  including myself  might consider to be of less than pressing importance  Among them are a  10 million dollar earmark for the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board and a  1 75 million dollar earmark for something called the Hawaii Humpback Education Program   This bill also provides needed funding for grants through the Small Business Administration  Unfortunately  the Appropriations Committee recommends that the SBA direct funding to 53 specific programs named in the Committee report  It is imperative  in the wake of Hurricane Katrina  that SBA grants be awarded on the basis of need and merit and not on the whim of a Member of Congress  despite what might be the best of intentions   The Sense of the Senate amendment that I am proposing would allow funding for earmarks that have not been authorized  have not been requested by the President  or are not related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina to be redirected to recovery efforts  This would occur if the agency or department head determines  after consultation with the appropriate Congressional Committees  that such an earmark is not of national significance or is not in the public interest   I appreciate the helpful efforts of Senator Shelby and his staff to secure the adoption of this modest amendment  I hope it can be easily adopted and not to take much of the Senates time  I could propose the impossible  that no earmarks be permitted in any appropriations bill  period  But I am not proposing the impossible  Or  I could propose what is suggested almost daily by the press that Congress turn in its pork  Many are rightly calling into question the thousands of projects in the highway bill  and suggesting the related project funding should more wisely be transferred to recovery efforts  The amendment isnt proposing that either  But perhaps next time  that will be the proposal I offer  particularly if  given the dire situation in the gulf  we cant even agree to preclude funding for projects that arent found to be in the public interest   Mr  President  this is a modest proposal  I would hope that my colleagues would overwhelmingly adopt it for the sake of those tens of thousands Americans who have lost almost everything and are relying on their government for necessary support as they struggle for what will be a long and difficult time  I call upon the appropriators and the leadership to pay careful attention to the funding measures yet to be debated and to do their part to ensure we are living up to our obligations to those who are suffering  even if it means that it comes at some of our personal political expense and ability to issue a press release on what weve delivered to our home state   Mr  President  in a time of national catastrophe  it is the responsibility of the United States Congress to take quick and decisive action to help those in need  It is not appropriate to continue the practice of earmarking scarce funds in the face of such a great tragedy  This should be a time of sacrifice for the sake of our suffering citizens                                                      September 2005 Press Releases           Browse by

Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on the floor of the Senate regarding an amendment he proposed regarding rail security   Mr  President  I call up amendment  4922 and ask for its immediate consideration   This amendment would ensure that  in addition to our efforts to improve port security  we also address another critical transportation mode  rail transportation  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators DeWine  Snowe and Biden   Mr  President  I am pleased that the Senate has chosen to take up the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 to protect our nations ports and waterways  The bill implements several recommendations from the 9 11 Commissions Final Report  including allocating security grants based on risk and comprehensive cargo screening  Additionally  the bill would establish an office within the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate all cargo security policy  develop a strategy for deployment of radiation detection capabilities in all ports  and establish a process to facilitate the movement of secure cargo from international ports to our ports without interrupting the international supply chain and delaying goods to consumers here in the United States   Securing our ports is a crucial part of our efforts to protect Americans at home  The amendment that I am offering today would complement the underlying legislation by providing essential funding and additional tools to strengthen our Nations rail system   Two years ago  the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Rail Security Act of 2004  legislation that was almost identical to the amendment that I am offering today  Unfortunately  that bill died in the House of Representatives  Last year  I reintroduced the legislation shortly after the London bombings of July 7  and language that is similar to the provisions of the Rail Security Act is in a title of the transportation security bill that was reported by the Commerce Committee in February  I sincerely hope that we will once again pass this important legislation  Rail security must be made a top priority of this Congress   Mr  President  we were all deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life caused by the 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid  the 2005 London attacks  and the terrorist attacks on commuter trains in Mumbai this summer  Those incidents are a painful reminder of the cruel nature of our enemies in our global war on terror  and of what we must do to fight and win against those who wish to eradicate our way of life  I have said on many occasions that we cannot just play defense in this war    that instead we must take the fight to the enemy  Still  we must do what is possible and prudent to protect Americans at home  The numerous attacks on rail systems abroad demonstrate all too vividly the continuing need for this legislation   There is little doubt that we have increased dramatically our security capabilities over the past five years  However  there is just as little doubt that we have much more to do  Since the attacks of 9 11  only relatively modest resources have been dedicated to rail security  Our Nations transit system  Amtrak  and the freight railroads  I am sad to say  remain vulnerable to terrorist threats  This lack of funding exists despite the fact that the Department of Homeland Security has identified as potential terrorist targets the freight and passenger rail networks  which are critical to the nations transportation system and national defense  The 9 11 Commission  too  in its report on the facts and circumstances surrounding the 9 11 attacks  called for improved security in all modes of transportation  noting that       terrorists may turn their attention to other modes   This amendment would authorize a total of almost  1 2 billion dollars for rail security  More than half of this funding would be authorized to complete tunnel safety and security improvements at New Yorks Penn Station  which is used by over 500 000 transit  commuter  and intercity passengers each workday  This funding is all the more urgent given this summer s arrest by the FBI of eight suspects tied to al Qaeda who were plotting attacks on train tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey   The legislation would also establish a grant program  authorized at  350 million dollars  to help increase security by the freight railroads  Amtrak  shippers of hazardous materials  and local governments with security responsibility for passenger stations not owned by Amtrak  Further  DHS would be required to complete a vulnerability assessment of the rail network to terrorist attack and make recommendations to Congress for addressing security weaknesses  Importantly  to protect the taxpayers  interests  all Amtrak authorizations would be managed by the Department of Transportation through formal grant agreements   Mr  President  we face a dedicated  focused  and intelligent foe in the war on terrorism  This enemy will probe to find our weaknesses and move against them  We have seen the vulnerabilities of rail to terrorism in other countries and the devastating consequences of such an attack  It is essential that we move expeditiously to protect all the modes of transportation from potential attack   Also  Mr  President  at this point I would like to note that this amendment is cosponsored by Senators DeWine  Snowe  and Biden  I thank the senators for their cosponsorship of this critical measure   I trust that the Senate will once again pass this essential legislation  We owe at least that much to the American people as we continue our struggle against an enemy that wants nothing less than to destroy everything we stand for and believe in

August 27  2007 WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today addressed the National Guard Association of the United States conference in San Juan  Puerto Rico  The remarks  as prepared for delivery  are as follows    Good morning  and thank you for the honor of being here with you for this 129th General Conference  I am proud to address such a distinguished group of patriots    I am here  in part  to say thank you for your service and your sacrifice on behalf of our beloved country  Every American who understands the true value of freedom  and the price that must be paid to preserve it  owes an eternal debt of gratitude to each you and to all of the brave and honorable citizen soldiers you are privileged to lead  The men and women of the National Guard are a national treasure    I was blessed to have been born into a family who made their living at sea in defense of our security and ideals  My grandfather was a naval aviator  my father a submariner  Their respect for me was one of the great ambitions of my life  And so it was nearly pre ordained that I would find a place in my familys profession  and that occupation would one day take me to war    Such was not the case for many of you  Your ambitions might not have led you to war  the honors you sought were not kept hidden on battlefields  Many of you were citizen soldiers  You answered the call when it came  took up arms and served for your countrys sake  and fought because you believed Americas security was as much your responsibility as it was the professional soldiers  And when you came home  you built a better a country than the one you inherited   I do not mean to dismiss the virtues of the professional soldier  I consider my inclusion in their ranks to be one of the great honors of my life  The Navy was and still remains the world I know best and love most   The world has changed dramatically since September 11  2001  Today  the National Guards role resembles  in many respects  the role it performed in World War II  when Guard units fought in every theater and every major campaign    Units such as Company A of the 116th Infantry Regimentthe famed Bedford Boys of the Virginia National Guardthat spearheaded the allied assault on Omaha Beach  June 6  1944  Prior to 9 11  a lot of us didnt always fully appreciate the power and potential of the Guard  and what it might one day be called upon to do  But my friends  we understand it now  Times have changedwe all understand that now   Today  thousands of National Guard soldiers and airmen once again fight alongside their active component comrades on every battlefield in the war against militant Islam  From the mountains of Afghanistan to the back alleys of Iraq  Guard and Reserve personnel are engaged in every aspect of this conflict   Todays National Guard soldiers and airmen  together with the Reserve forces  are the citizen soldiers of the next Great Generation  You are the role models of freedom  who bravely set aside self interest  and forgo the comforts of home  the economic security of your jobs and enterprises  and the company of your families to undertake the hard work of freedom  to do your part in preserving our precious gift of liberty  protecting our cherished values  and securing the life and property of fellow human beings  often by risking your own    The men and women of the National Guard represent the very best of what it means to be an American and what our country is truly all aboutfree people of every race  creed  color  and ethnic background  who regard it as their sacred duty not simply to indulge in the rights and privileges of citizenship  but to answer its obligations    No matter the danger to our security or safety  at home or abroad  whether from the violent foes of freedom or the turbulent forces of nature  wherever and whenever America has called  the National Guard has answered  You have always been ready  You have always been there   For everyone in the military todaywhether you are Guard  Active  or Reservethese are difficult times  We are a nation at war  and we have asked of our men and women of the armed forces an almost unprecedented level of commitment and sacrifice  Extended deployments and back to back combat tours have become the standard rather than the exception    In the face of these demands  the distinction between the Guard and Active forcesa distinction that once was so clearis now virtually undetectable  In 2005  Army National Guard brigades made up more than 50  of the combat units in Iraq  Not since WWII have we asked so much of the Guard  not only overseas but at home where the Guard must continue to fulfill its critical duties securing the homeland from attack  and responding to emergencies that threaten lives and property almost every day   Fortunately for America  today the men and women of the National Guard  are cut from the same patriotic cloth as their predecessors who answered the call at Concord and Bunker Hill  Gettysburg and Cold Harbor  the Argonne Forrest  and the beaches of Normandy   They are men like Master Sergeant Keary Miller of the 123rd Special Tactics Squadron of the Kentucky Air Guardwho  in March 2002  boarded a CH 47 in an attempt to rescue two stranded American servicemen from a mountainous area of Afghanistan swarming with al Qeada and Taliban forces  The helicopter took heavy fire and crashed  injuring several on board  Ultimately  seven American lives were lost  but many more were saved  thanks to the courage of Master Sergeant Keary Miller   With total disregard for his own safety  Master Sergeant Miller helped establish a defensive perimeter  then tended the wounded  protected them from enemy fire  and established MEDEVAC collection points  But that was not enough for this Fighting Kentuckian  This was a gunfight for survival  and Master Sergeant Miller ensured the success of his team by gathering up ammunition and distributing it among those still able to fight  making sure everyones weapon was replenished and no one was left defenseless  Master Sergeant Miller was credited with saving the lives of ten gravely wounded Americans   These were the actions of an American patriot  a citizen soldier and true hero who epitomized the creed of the Air Force para rescueman That Others May Live  and one who followed the motto of all Bluegrass State warriorsto Fight Like Kentuckians   The world in which many of us served in the past was a dangerous one  but more stable than the world today  It was a world where we confronted a massive  organized threat to our security  Our enemy was evil  but not irrational  And for all the suffering endured by captive nations  for all the fear of global nuclear war  it was a world made fairly predictable by a stable balance of power until our steadfastness and patience yielded an historic victory for our security and ideals  That world is gone  and please dont mistake my reminiscence as an indication that I miss it  If Im nostalgic for it at all  it is only an old mans nostalgia for the time where he misspent his youth  That world  after all  had much cruelty and terror  some of which it was our fate to witness personally   Today  we glimpse the prospect of another  better world  in which all people might someday share in the blessings and responsibilities of freedom  But we also face a threat and a long war to defeat it that is as difficult and in many respects more destabilizing than any challenge we have ever faced  We confront an enemy that so despises us and modernity itself that they would use any means  unleash any terror  cause the most unimaginable suffering to harm us  and to destroy the world we have tried throughout our history to build    As we meet  in Iraq and Afghanistan  American soldiers  Marines  sailors and airmen are fighting bravely and tenaciously in battles that are as dangerous  difficult and consequential as the great battles of our armed forces storied past  As we all know  the war in Iraq has not gone well  and the American people have grown sick and tired of it  I understand that  of course  I  too  have been made sick at heart by the many mistakes made by civilian and military commanders and the terrible price we have paid for them  But we cannot react to these mistakes by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake  a mistake of colossal historical proportions  which will  and I am as sure of this as I am of anything  seriously endanger the country I have served all my adult life    In the coming month we will face a fork in the road  We can pursue our opportunity for victory in Iraq  strengthen our hand in the larger war against Islamic extremists  and make our nation more secure  Or we can fold our tents  embolden our enemies  throw a region into instability  and increase the risks faced on our home soil  Which way requires greater leadership  I plan to lead the fight in September on the floor of the United States Senate to support our troops and in support of victory and against a plan for defeat    We have new commanders in Iraq  and they are following a counterinsurgency strategy that I have advocated from the beginning of this war  which makes the most effective use of our strength and doesnt strengthen the tactics of our enemy  This new battle plan is succeeding where our previous tactics failed  Although the outcome remains uncertain  we must give General Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to command adequate time to salvage from the wreckage of our past mistakes a measure of stability for Iraq and the Middle East  and a more secure future for the American people  To concede defeat now would strengthen al Qaeda  empower Iran and other hostile powers in the Middle East  unleash a full scale civil war in Iraq that could quite possibly provoke genocide there  and destabilize the entire region as neighboring powers come to the aid of their favored factions  The consequences would threaten us for years  and I am certain would eventually draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would impose even greater sacrifices on us    Our defeat in Iraq would be catastrophic  not just for Iraq  but for us  and I cannot be complicit in it  I will do whatever I can  whether I am effective or not  to help avert it  That is all I can offer my country  It is not much compared to the sacrifices made by Americans who have volunteered to shoulder a rifle and fight this war for us  I know that and am humbled by it  But though my duty is neither dangerous nor onerous  it compels me nonetheless to say to my fellow Americans  as long as we have a chance to succeed we must try to succeed    I have many responsibilities to the American people  and I try to take them all seriously  But I have one responsibility that outweighs all the others  and that is to use whatever meager talents I possess  and every resource God has granted me to protect the security of this great and good nation from all enemies foreign and domestic  And that I intend to do  even if I must stand athwart popular opinion  I will attempt to convince as many of my countrymen as I can that we must show even greater patience  though our patience is nearly exhausted so we can defeat our enemies  That is how I construe my responsibility to my country  That is how I construed it yesterday  It is how I construe it today  It is how I will construe it tomorrow  I do not know how I could choose any other course   The new security environment in which we live will continue to pose great challenges  and require that we use all elements of national power to defeat radicalism  The National Guard will play a vital role in this multi dimensional effort  precisely because its citizen soldiers and airmen bring such a wide range of skills and capacities to the force   As we go forward  America must make a new and lasting commitment to our National Guarda commitment that will ensure the force is properly manned  trained  led  and equipped to undertake the growing scope of missions we ask of you both at home and abroad   Such commitment must begin with our political leadership recognizing the sheer magnitude of what we ask Guard units to accomplish with a force comprised primarily of part time soldiers and airmen    Such commitment means providing sufficient end strengths in the Active  Guard and Reserve components consistent with the workload imposed on our military  We must do a better job of following the guidelines regarding the frequency and duration of deployments  Failure to do so abuses the trust of those who serve  and is a national disgrace   It means ensuring that the Guard has the proper equipment with which to train and deploy  We must never  never  ask our young men and women to go into harms way without the equipment and training they need to do their job effectively and safelywhether the enemy they face is a military force  terrorist cell  pandemic disease  earthquake  fire  or flood    It means that our nations leaders must set wiser priorities in the allocation of national resources  The Congress must stop funding bridges to nowhere and thousands of other pork barrel projects while we shortchange our service members and fail to provide what they need to defend our nation   It means getting rid of Defense Department policies  practices  and customs that fail to promote a seamless total force based on cooperation  jointness  and the mutual respect that all components have earned with their blood and bravery  It means establishing a new compact with our Guard and Reserve component personnel to ensure they have the pay they deserve  the career opportunities they merit  and the level of service that befits their time  capability  and need  It means making certain that our Guard and Reserve members  and their families  receive the proper health care they deserve and have been promised  It means guaranteeing that all injured service members are treated with equal care and dignity   And  my friends  it means a national leadership that respects and treats our governors and Adjutant Generals as partners in national and homeland security policymaking  rather than as impediments and intruders  As far as Im concerned part of that essential effort must be granting the Chief of the National Guard Bureau the fourth star that the position merits  and updating the charter of the Bureau to align it with the scope and importance of its mission today    Achieving these imperatives will require breaking old paradigms  shedding outdated thinking  and understanding the new capabilities that are so vital in the modern security environment  It will require less partisanship and greater political will  Above all  it demands strong leadership at all levels of government and the military    From great challenges  emerge great opportunities  Ours is a time of unprecedented challenge  With it comes the opportunity to make our country safer  the world better  and the future brighter  We can do this  We can seize this opportunity for our good and the good of our children  but only if we exercise the resolve that America has always demonstrated in momentous times when our security and the prospects of the worlds future hung in the balance    I would like to close as I beganby saying thank you  To the National Guardsmen who today will walk combat patrols in Iraq and Afghanistan  to those who will fly missions in support of our deployed forces  to those engaged back home in humanitarian efforts to relieve suffering  and to all of you who know what it means to stand the long night watches  thank you  You understand both the valueand the price  of freedom  You are the best among us    In whatever capacity Providence grants that I serve my country I pledge to you my undying fidelity to the cause to which you devote your livesthe safety and security of Americaand a National Guard that will always be ready  and always be there    Thank you                                                  August 2007 Press Releases           Browse by

2006 Washington D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  testified today before the to Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for its hearing to Examine Procedures to Make the Legislative Process More Transparent  The following prepared statement was submitted for the record   Let me begin by commending the Chairman of the Rules Committee  Senator Lott  for holding today s hearing on one of the key components that must be addressed if our efforts to address comprehensive lobbying reform are to be effective and that is  earmark reform  This is the second hearing on this subject held by this Committee in the last two Congresses  and I commend the committee members for their attention to this issue of growing concern   You may recall the earmark growth charts I showed the Committee during a July 2003 hearing which illustrated the findings of the Congressional Research Service  showing the enormous growth in earmarks since 1994  Well  I am sad to report those numbers are even more alarming today    Refer to updated Charts   In 1994  there were 4 126 earmarks  In 2005  there were 15 877  the largest number yet   That s an increase of nearly 300 percent  The level of funding associated with those earmarks has more than doubled from  23 2 billion in FY 1994 to  47 4 billion in FY 2005  I ask that a copy of the report prepared by CRS be made a part of the hearing record   The focus of the July 2003 hearing was a rules change proposal I had introduced to allow points of order to be raised against unauthorized appropriations and policy riders in appropriations bills and conference reports in an effort to reign in wasteful pork barrel spending  Tomorrow I will introduce a modified version of that proposal  I will be joined in this bipartisan effort by Senators Feingold  Coburn  Bayh  Sununu  Graham  Ensign  DeMint  and Kyl   Our bill  entitled the Pork Barrel Reduction Act  would establish a new procedure under Rule XVI  modeled in part after the Byrd Rule  which would allow a 60 vote point of order to be raised against specific provisions that contain unauthorized appropriations  including earmarks  as well as unauthorized policy changes in appropriations bills and conference reports  Of importance is that successful points of order would not kill a conference report  but the targeted provisions would be deemed removed from the conference report  and the measure would be sent back for concurrence by the House   To ensure that Members are given enough time to review appropriations bills  our proposal would also require that conference reports be available at least 48 hours prior to floor consideration  It also prohibits the consideration of a conference report if it includes matter outside the scope of conference   Additionally  our bill includes the provisions of S  1495  the Obligation of Funds Transparency Act  which Senator Coburn and I introduced last July  to prohibit Federal agencies from obligating funds for appropriations earmarks included only in congressional reports  which are unamendable   To promote transparency  our bill requires that any earmarks included in a bill be disclosed fully in the bill s accompanying report  along with the name of the Member who requested the earmark and its essential governmental purpose  Additionally  our bill would require recipients of federal dollars to disclose any amounts that the recipient expends on registered lobbyists   In summary  this proposed rules change  if adopted  would allow any member to raise a point of order in an effort to extract objectionable unauthorized provisions from the appropriations process  Our goal is to reform the current system by empowering all members with a tool to rid appropriations bills of unauthorized funds  pork barrel projects  and legislative policy riders and to provide greater public disclosure of the legislative process   I understand Chairman Lott and Senator Feinstein introduced a resolution that doesn t go quite as far as our proposal   it would only allow points of order against earmarks and provisions outside the scope of conference  There bill is a good step in the right direction  although I am concerned that it would not allow us to go after a host of egregious earmarks  Nonetheless  I am pleased they have embraced the general concept that we are suggesting  which is to enable objectionable earmarks to be removed from bills and more importantly  conference reports  in a manner that would remove any suspicions that we are attempting to kill the whole conference report   Examples  I would like to mention some specific examples of recent earmarks  many of which clearly do not belong in the measures that they were included   From the Defense Conference Report for FY

unprecedented language was inserted into the final bill to allow the U S  Air Force to lease 100 Boeing 767 commercial aircraft and convert them to tankers  The total cost to taxpayers  about  30 billion   However  Congress did not authorize these provisions in the Act  or in any other bill for that matter  In fact  the Senate Armed Services Committee was not even advised of this effort by the Air Force Secretary during consideration of the authorization measure  Moreover  these aircraft were not in the president s budget  the joint chiefs  unfunded priority list  or the pentagon s long range defense budget  Additionally  the purportedly compelling need for these aircraft  which the air force repeatedly cited for having taxpayers pay  6 billion more for leasing these tankers than they would if the air force simply bought them outright  was  and continues to be  wholly unsupported by any serious study or analysis of alternatives   Nonetheless  legislative language was again included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003 to modify the previous year s bill language on the Boeing 767 tankers  And  once again  the sweeping changes in procurement policy was made by the Appropriators without the input of the authorizing committee   Ultimately  it was discovered that the air force broke a number of federal budgetary and leasing rules  that the lease terms were fiscally irresponsible  that this deal would have set a horrible precedent for the procurement of major defense systems  and that folks at the air force conspired with Boeing to break the law to make this deal happen in the first instance  Mr  Chairman  with some people  as a result  not only losing their jobs  but also serving time in jail  I think everyone in this room knows what an egregious mistake this turned out to be    From Supplemental for War on Terror Conference Report  April 2005   A provision directing the Secretary of the Interior to analyze the viability of a sanctuary for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow in Rio Grande Valley  TX   A provision stating that the  40M set forth in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 for construction of a Port of Philadelphia marine cargo terminal  be used solely for the construction by and for a Philadelphia based company    From the FY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report   The conference report contained provisions which allow a subsidiary of the Malaysian owned  Norwegian Cruise Lines  the exclusive right to operate several large foreign built cruise vessels in the domestic cruise trade  This provides an unfair competitive advantage to a foreign company at the expense of all other cruise ship operators  and creates a de facto monopoly for Norwegian Cruise Lines in the Hawaii cruise trade  Interestingly  this provision stems from another earmark in 1998 that went awry   The FY 1998 Department of Defense Appropriation Bill granted a legal monopoly for American Classic Voyages to operate as the only U S  flagged operator among the Hawaiian islands  After receiving the monopoly  American Classic Voyages secured a  1 1 billion loan guarantee from the U S  Maritime Administration s  MARAD  Title XI loan guarantee program for the construction of two passenger vessels known as Project America  Project America s subsequent failure four years later resulted in the U S  Maritime Administration paying out over  187 3 million of the American taxpayers  money to cover the project s loan default  and recovering only  2 million from the sale of some of the construction materials and parts  It is one hull and miscellaneous parts from these never completed ships which cost the taxpayers nearly  200 million which are now going to be used in a foreign shipyard for building the Norwegian Cruise ships that will operate in Hawaii under this latest special interest provision   The conference report included an agriculture policy change to make catfish producers eligible for payments under the livestock compensation program  even though hog  poultry  and horse producers are not eligible   Despite the fact that the U S  Department of Agriculture had implemented new organic food standards after lengthy negotiations  language was added to the conference report to permit livestock producers to certify and label meat products as  organic  even if the animals had not been fed organic grain  Without any consideration or debate  this last minute rider was added to override these standards  Interestingly  a few months later  the Congress approved legislation as part of the War supplemental to repeal this provision and restore the prior organic food labeling standards   Obviously  I could go on and on and on citing examples of unauthorized earmarks and policy riders in appropriations bills  But I think you ve got the picture  And I hope that we have finally reached the point that we are going to do something to reform this very broken system of legislating   Closing  Our current economic situation and our vital national security concerns require that now  more than ever  we prioritize our federal spending  But our appropriations bills do not always put our national priorities first  The process is broken and it needs to be fixed   In his farewell address  President Dwight D  Eisenhower reflected on the spending he believed to be excessive  His words then are all the more powerful in today s out of control environment    As we peer into society s future   he said   we   you and I  and our government   must avoid the impulse to live only for today  plundering  for our own ease and convenience  the precious resources of tomorrow  We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage  We want democracy to survive for all generations to come  not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow    And yet  if we cannot change  if we will not change  we risk precisely that   becoming the insolvent phantom of tomorrow  I wonder what President Eisenhower would think of this mess  But  then  perhaps others have contemplated the same question  After all  the Defense Appropriations bill we passed in December included a  1 7 million earmark for a memorial on the National Mall that would honor none other than        Dwight D  Eisenhower   I thank

Senator John McCain  R AZ   today made the following statement on H J  Res 20 Making Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2007       Mr  President  I think most of us agree that funding the federal government should be done through the regular order  not through a patch work of continuing resolutions  The reality is that all but two federal agencies are being funded through a measure to which no member is being permitted to offer  debate  or vote on a single amendment  That is wrong  We are not the House of Representatives  We are the Senate   the deliberative body  I hope the Senate leadership on both sides will work to ensure that we don   t repeat this fate      There is one silver lining to the measure pending before us  It is largely free of wasteful earmarking and pork barrel spending  This is the first time during my years in Congress that I have witnessed such an occurrence  Compare this to the last fiscal year  2006  according to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service  the appropriations bills and accompanying reports for the last fiscal year included  64 Billion in earmarks   the largest earmarked funding in history  So again  this CR  which does not have an accompanying report where historically 95 percent of earmarks are included  is a welcome  welcome change  I can only urge the Appropriations Committee to let this be a guide for future appropriations measures when it comes to earmarks   don   t include them and don   t waste the taxpayers dollars      I was pleased to join with several of my colleagues in writing the President last week to urge his leadership on this issue and ensure his Administration understands clearly and fully that it is under absolutely no obligation to continue to fund earmarks that were included in past committee reports or urged by members of Congress or their staff  As stated by the President in his State of the Union address just last month  when it comes to earmarking     The time has come to end this practice     It is up to the Administration to abide by the President   s directive and I assure you  we will be watching       Also last week  Senator Coburn and I received a response from Department of Energy Secretary  Sam Bodman  in response to our letter the previous week stating our serious concerns about reports that the Department may be planning    business as usual    and would fund conference report earmarks  Fortunately  the Secretary has clarified his Department   s position  and will only fund programs or activities that are    meritorious and effective    and    support and advance the Department   s missions and objectives       I ask unanimous consent that copies of our correspondence with the Secretary be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks       Despite what I have described as a positive consequence of this CR  the measure is imperfect and  like many of my colleagues  I believe we should have had an opportunity to improve it  I am particularly concerned about underfunding the Base Realignment Closure  BRAC  account  and was pleased to join in cosponsoring the amendment filed by Senators Hutchison and Inhofe to fund the account at the amount requested by the President and the amount we authorized for 2007       Mr  President  the 55 percent cut to the BRAC account  submitted without any type of justification or explanation  seriously jeopardizes the Department of Defense   s ability to meet a statutory deadline to complete all BRAC actions by 2011  Congress imposed this six year deadline specifically to limit the negative impact on the military units and local communities around the country affected by BRAC  Congress intended that a concentrated period of investment would accelerate the economic development and recovery of communities affected by BRAC  This callous decision to deny funds to the Department at this critical juncture directly harms these communities as much as it does the military units placed in limbo by the sudden denial of funds      The Administration noted in its recent response to the CR that the BRAC cut will  reduce BRAC savings  delay or postpone scheduled redeployments of military personnel and their families from overseas locations to the United States  and negatively impact many communities throughout the country that have begun making specific plans in response to BRAC         Surely our colleagues who developed this CR proposal did not intend to cause additional harm to the local communities that are already trying to cope and recover from the BRAC decisions  Quoting Congressman David Obey  Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee  about the CR   I don t expect people to love this proposal  I don t love this proposal  and we probably have made some wrong choices        So  why are we in the Senate not allowed an opportunity to correct an obvious mistake       Mr  President  I   ve heard from the other side of the aisle during debate of H J  Res 20 that they understand this problem and that they plan to correct this  3 1 billion BRAC underfunding in the Fiscal Year 2007 Emergency Supplemental request of  93 4 billion  What kind of solution is that  Supplemental funds have been requested by the President for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  These funds are critically needed to purchase equipment for force protection and IED defeat initiatives  These funds will be used to train and equip Iraqi security forces  Since when is BRAC an emergency related to the Global War on Terror      Furthermore  we are having this discussion because my colleagues who developed the resolution share with us the common goal to reduce overall government expenditures  In that spirit  what critical warfighting requirement will we cut in the supplemental to pay for the BRAC increase they propose  What do we deny to our front line fighting troops  While I have heard the idea of funding BRAC in the supplemental  I have not heard one idea on how to pay for it  Do they instead advocate for an increase to the supplemental  Why not just provide the funds to BRAC by offsets in the pending measure before us  as proposed by the Hutchison amendment  We should be addressing full fiscal year 2007 funding for BRAC in this CR  Using budget gimmicks and shell games in a supplemental  which could have devastating results for the military and local communities  is not the way to provide appropriations for critical military requirements       And  finally  Mr  President  I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague  Dr  Coburn  He has been on the floor several times to discuss the very serious ramifications of the provision in this bill that will prohibit funding for what is known as the    baby AIDS    program  I   ve often commented that we need to start making tough fiscal decisions around here among competing priorities  But I have yet to hear anyone defend or even attempt to explain the decision that was made to prohibit funding for this critical program       I completely agree with Dr  Coburn  This funding prohibition is regrettable  and may have far reaching and devastating consequences for those helpless babies who could otherwise be given a better chance at having and keeping healthy lives      I yield the floor

S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the following address to the Economic Club of New York   Thank you  it s a great pleasure to be here today   My friends  more than twenty five years after Ronald Reagan rededicated our national energies to the principles of personal  political  and economic freedom  his legacy has helped to change the world profoundly   We have proven that empowering free markets and free people is the bulwark of liberty and the surest means to prosperity  We have helped other countries embrace our free market principles  and they have flourished beyond their wildest imaginations  But the United States remains the most prosperous country on earth   Ronald Reagan s generation    the greatest generation fought the evils of despotism and bequeathed to us  at tremendous cost  a country free and secure  We have honored the sacrifices of our forebears by nurturing and protecting our inheritance  taking up the responsibilities of freedom  and building a nation and an economy that is the envy of the world   While the world is freer  it is still dangerous  While it is more prosperous  there is still much that threatens the progress we have made both at home and abroad  America s national security and economic prosperity have always gone hand in hand  Fulfilling the promise of American greatness in a global economy rests on our ability to provide a safe and stable environment for working men and women  for innovators and entrepreneurs  and for our children on whom the world will soon depend  as they have depended on us  to advance the glorious cause of human freedom   What would our parents  who fought and died in Europe and the Pacific to defeat totalitarianism  say about the challenges we face  They would answer  as it has been from the day we declared our independence  our peace and prosperity rest on our faithfulness to our ideals and our courage   We have much to be hopeful about  The great promise of participating in the prosperous world economy has led nations to move toward freer and more open systems   But our success in building a world where people compete as entrepreneurs in the market place rather than as adversaries on battlefields  rests on the free world s ability to maintain peace and stability  secure the global commons for the exercise of liberty  and provide for the free flow of ideas  goods  and services  These goals are a central part of our nation s security  defense  and military strategies   But no security strategy can succeed without a firm economic foundation  My friends  we know that in war there is no substitute for victory  In peace there is no substitute for growth  All nations hold a stake in our economic progress  End growth in America and the lights go out all over the world   Even so  America s greatness makes it a primary target for those who oppose the spread of the principles we cherish  Democracy  freedom  security  and prosperity are the four pillars of human progress  The strength of each depends greatly on that of the others  and the enemies of liberty know that   Looking back to the events of 9 11  we cannot rid from our memories the terrible human tragedies that occurred    the loss of life  devastation  and destruction  However  it is easy to forget the economic dimensions of that horrible day  Our enemies targeted the American economy and made the disruption of our financial markets one of their primary goals  The economy was  we now know  already in recession  Financial markets tumbled  Analysts worried that the risk taking and entrepreneurship that have been the engine of our prosperity would be hampered by fear and uncertainty  For many  the only question was how far the economy would sink   Yet a tremendous thing happened  As our nation rose to confront our enemies  American workers and entrepreneurs resumed their productivity with renewed confidence  Who in the world thought back then that the years ahead would deliver high growth  millions of new jobs  and soaring wealth  Americans did  my friends  Americans   Our government must stand up resolutely for our ideals as the American people have whenever they have been tested    not only to discourage and defeat those who would attack us and challenge the cause of freedom  but to further empower Americans to take the risks and make the investments that will make our country stronger  Fulfilling our security responsibilities requires a sober and honest assessment of the threats to our security  reaching across boundaries to engage allies in our cause  and strategic thinking that anticipates the dangers posed in today s world and tomorrow s   Just as we must anticipate and confront outside threats using all instruments of our national power  we must face the very real threats emanating from home that endanger our prosperity  Even in a world of political stability  our current economic policies will undermine our economic well being   A tsunami of entitlement spending is threatening our economy  while providing no real security to retirees  We have made promises that we cannot keep  Under moderately optimistic scenarios Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid will in the decades to come grow as large as the entire government is today  Someday the government will be forced to make drastic cuts in these programs  or crippling increases in taxes on workers    or both  The longer we wait to make the hard choices necessary to repair these programs  the harder the problem becomes  My children and their children will not receive the benefits we will enjoy  That is an inescapable fact  and any politician who tells you otherwise  Democrat or Republican  is lying   It is hardly statesmanship to ignore the obvious imperative of reducing the growth of spending for retiree income support  health care  and long term care  And yet  year after year  our government fails to act  This failure has a real and distressing cost  Our workers make their retirement plans based on promised benefits that cannot be paid even if we burden our children with crippling taxes  If we fix the system now  people will have time to plan accordingly  to ensure that they still have a comfortable retirement  If we wait  we make the problem worse and  in effect  lie to Americans who we encouraged to put their trust in a broken system   I have long supported supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts    but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept  People of good faith in both parties agree that we must make the hard decisions to restore solvency to these programs and that personal accounts can ease the impact of slower benefit growth  But  too often  we prefer to nurture our own ambitions rather than defend the public interest  It is long past time for our two parties to sit down together and fix our pressing entitlement problems  And while it is a smaller problem than health care  we should start with Social Security because the fix is obvious in comparison  and much simpler   While booming entitlement spending threatens us in the long run  our short term fiscal situation is terrible as well  In the past six years  government spending has gone from irresponsible to utterly indefensible  The numbers should shock us  and government s indifference to them should shame us  According to the latest figures  spending in the 2005 fiscal year was  683 billion higher than it was in 2000  If we had simply held spending growth in check we would not have a budget deficit today   Some of this money has necessarily been spent on the war on terror that was unexpected and has been obviously and hugely expensive  While at the same time we know we must focus most of our defense spending on tomorrow s threats  not yesterday s  But when Ronald Reagan increased defense spending to win the Cold War  he slowed non defense spending growth at the same time  This time  we have fallen again for that most alluring delusion  we have tried to have our cake and eat it too  Non defense spending  often on the most unnecessary projects  is out of control   Legislators pass pork filled bills without the fear of public retribution or presidential veto  Federal spending  and the special interest earmarks that destroy the budget process and waste taxpayer dollars by the billions continues at a breakneck pace  Sadly  we haven t reformed the bankrupt tax and spend policies decried by Ronald Reagan  We have  it is now evident  merely replaced them with a new and even more insidious scheme of borrow and spend  We are fooling no one  my friends  Inevitably  the bill will come due  In the mean time  we rack up big debts  With those debts come higher and higher interest payments each year  Instead of spending the tax payers  dollars on real priorities  more and more of them will be devoted simply to keeping the bill collectors at bay  Bills that perpetuate wasteful spending should be vetoed    not some of them  all of them   I have always believed in the power of the American people  and the importance of keeping marginal tax rates low  But  tax cuts work best when accompanied by lower spending  In recent years I have opposed some Republican fiscal initiatives out of concern for the absence of spending restraint  and the higher deficits they cause  which hamstring our ability to respond to future crises   But the answer to these deficits is not to raise new taxes or repeal tax cuts but to restrain our spending habits  If the federal government can t be funded with current revenues than we must reduce its size  Higher taxes and greater spending discourage entrepreneurship  foster wasteful tax planning and slow long term growth  Intelligently formulated tax cuts and sensible tax reform will deliver much higher growth when they are accompanied by lower spending   When the government s budget is tighter  the family budget won t have to be  If our government is forced to make more hard choices  our families will be forced to make fewer   Recent events have also made it clear that rising energy costs and our dangerous dependence on an unreliable supply from unstable parts of the world is potentially crippling to our economy  When Wall Street wants to limit risk  it diversifies  The obvious approach to resolve our energy problems is to increase and diversify our sources of power and look for ways to reduce our demand  We have promising technologies in development  but also proven alternatives at hand    the most obvious of which is nuclear   Genuine improvement in our energy security  must respect markets and avoid the temptations of nearsighted politics  While it is tempting to assail windfall profits and executive compensation  it is not a substitute for a viable and long term energy strategy  We will never be fully independent of global energy markets  But we must work for the day that energy supply volatility no longer imperils our economy and our security   A global rising tide of protectionism and a retreat from market based economic policy is threatening the entrepreneurs of developed and developing countries alike   Free trade is the key to global economic growth  and a key to U S  economic success  We need stand up for free trade with no ifs  ands or buts about it  We let trade and globalization be politicized at our own peril   Today  despite all the defeatist rhetoric  America is the world s biggest exporter  importer  producer  saver  investor  manufacturer and innovator  Americans do not shy from the challenge of competition  they welcome it  Because of that  we attract foreign investment from all over the world  Our government should welcome competition as the people do  and not resort to mindless protectionism   While we embrace free trade  it is important to recognize that trade can lead to painful dislocations for some individuals  We must remain committed to education  retraining  and help for displaced workers all the while reminding ourselves that our ability to change is a great strength of our nation  We cannot let fear and the appeals of protectionists lead us backward   My friends  in the course of my lifetime our economy has undergone unbelievable changes  When I was a kid  our economy grew by producing more and more of the same  We now have an ideas economy where growth comes from making new things  not larger quantities of the old things   If you walked into my house when I was twenty years old  my parents would have proudly displayed the same appliances they had when I was ten years old  Today I walk into my own house and am awestruck by the marvels my family uses    flash drives  Ipods and Tivos  things we never could have dreamed of  have become part of our every day lives   Our economy is like that now  Advances in information technologies have made us better at discovery  quicker to find the new idea that works  In this world  America has succeeded because we have been more willing to embrace and encourage change than our competitors  And we have opened our doors to the best and brightest from other countries to seek the American dream  The transformation has been dramatic  Today  American firms spend more money each year researching new ideas and processes than they do on new buildings and machines   As our economy has changed  too often  Washington has not kept pace  The business community understands the borderless world of the global economy far better than most policymakers and Washington has much to learn from you  Today  old industries dominate the trade debate  even while the intellectual property rights of our most innovative firms are ignored by some of our trading partners  An effective government must evolve with the economy and protect our ideas  and keep the new economy free of bureaucratic interference  restrictive red tape and unnecessary regulations   The challenges are great  but the costs of failure even greater   We now accept that the world where a worker can expect to stay with one employer  making one product  for the rest of his life  is gone forever  That willingness to change has brought us great wealth  but it has produced anxiety as well  While the economy is booming  surveys suggest that Americans are much more anxious about our future economic  political  and physical security   Some of that anxiety is perhaps justified  Change can cause dislocation and fear  and the opportunities of economic growth are not always apparent to all Americans  These anxieties are exacerbated when those elected to govern spend more of our time on our own ambitions than their concerns  We face serious challenges  and many Americans worry that their government cannot be relied on to face them forthrightly  We have given them cause for that concern   But America s strength has always resided in its people    in their industry  courage and imagination  A government accountable to such a people cannot forever ignore their priorities  burden their industry  impede their progress  It is a wonderful thing to be elected to high office in this great and good republic  But it is a shameful thing to cherish that office more than you value the public good   The times we live in pose difficult  but no greater challenges to us than we have faced in the past  Americans will meet them  as they always have  confident that a nation conceived in liberty will prove stronger  more decent and more enduring than any nation ordered to exalt the few at the expense of the many or made from a common race or culture or to preserve traditions that have no greater attribute than longevity   Those of us privileged to serve such a people  must prove an equal faith in the strength and righteousness of our ideals  confident that we hold a greater privilege than high office  that we have the honorable distinction of being part of a people living as one nation  in a kinship of ideals  who are making of our power and wealth a civilization for the ages  a civilization in which all people might share in the blessings and responsibilities of freedom                                              June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by

  Last week the U.S. Senate set aside immigration reform legislation, hoping to return to the subject in a few weeks. Senate Democrats abused the rules by refusing to allow consideration of any amendments, and even Republicans who supported the legislation agreed it was wrong to vote on the bill until amendments could be dealt with.  
   I oppose the legislation, among other reasons, because it would provide an automatic pathway to citizenship for the illegal immigrants already here as well as all ""temporary"" workers allowed to come to the U.S. in the future. That is unwise, unfair, and unnecessary: unwise because jobs that exist today in an expanding economy will not necessarily be there in the next economic downturn; unfair to the millions of would-be legal immigrants waiting patiently in line (in their countries) to come here; and unnecessary because most come here illegally to work, earn money, and return to their home country--not because they want to become citizens. 
   We must make sure that the resources and will to enforce any new immigration reform exists. The first amendment I filed would have disallowed criminals or ""absconders"" from receiving the benefits of any new legislation--neither citizenship nor legal permanent residence should be allowed for those who have already been convicted of serious crimes or deliberately violated a removal order of an immigration judge; yet the Democratic Leader has steadfastly refused to allow a vote on the amendment. 
   Legislation I introduced last year would provide the resources to secure the border and enforce the law in the interior, as well as ensure only legal residents (and citizens) can be employed. Under my proposal, the temporary worker program would grant only temporarymillion over the next 10 years. 
   No one has suggested rounding up and deporting illegal immigrants. Nor has anyone in the Senate advocated prosecution of anyone who provides humanitarian assistance to immigrants. There are other myths abound. That's unfortunate, for we ought to have a civil and comprehensive discussion of this critically important issue. 
   I hope when the Senate completes other business, it can get back to immigration reform. The longer we wait to solve the problem the harder it will be to solve. But it's got to be done right; and if we are not absolutely serious about enforcing the new law, it would be better not to pass it. The next amnesty would attract many millions of illegal immigrants from all over the world. That would be unacceptable.

  Senate Democrats and other opponents of President Bush's nomination of Alberto Gonzales for U.S. Attorney General have alleged, in harshly personal terms, that Gonzales somehow undercut the Geneva Conventions by issuing a legal opinion that, even though all combat detainees must be treated humanely, the privileges and immunities granted to uniformed soldiers held as prisoners of war do not extend to terrorists and other unlawful combatants captured by US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   What this criticism ignores is that a long list of unbiased analysts have reached the same conclusion, including: three different federal courts; the 9/11 Commission; an independent review panel led by former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger; and a group of former State Department legal advisers, judge advocates general, military commanders and liberal international law scholars who filed a brief in a recent U.S. Supreme Court case.  
   The Geneva Conventions, ratified by the U.S. Senate, specifically exclude extending P.O.W. protections to unlawful combatants - i.e., to those who violate the laws of war, do not wear uniforms, and do not operate under a responsible command structure. Does any reasonable person doubt that Al Qaeda fits this definition? 
   Andrew C. McCarthy, who led the 1995 terrorism prosecution against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, eloquently states the obvious in noting that Al Qaeda does not meet the test of lawful combatant: 
   ""Since the early 1990s, al Qaeda has, at the very least ... urged the murder of all Americans - civilians and military alike - wherever on the globe they may be found; conducted simultaneous sneak attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, resulting in the mass murder of over 240 civilians (the vast majority of them Muslims and non-Americans); murdered 3,000 Americans in hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon; and spearheaded guerrilla wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   In addition to killing civilians in sneak attacks - commonly, detonating bombs within nondescript cars parked or driven in broad daylight in densely populated areas - they also secrete themselves among their once and future victims. They wear no distinguishing insignia to segregate themselves as a militia. They use mosques and schools and hospitals to plan and store weaponry. They feign surrender and then open fire on unsuspecting coalition forces attempting the civilized act of detaining, rather than shooting, them. As for treatment of their own detainees, their practice ranges from execution-style homicide to beastly beheading - usually captured on film and circulated on the Internet.""
   In applying these realities to the clear terms of the Geneva Conventions, Mr. Gonzales was simply doing his job. 
   It's worth considering the extensive privileges that the Geneva Conventions afford honorable combatants. They include athletic uniforms, scientific instruments, kitchenettes and ""a monthly pay allowance in Swiss francs,"" as Lee A. Casey and David Rivkin Jr. have noted in the National Review. Moreover, questioners are not even allowed to entice such detainees to cooperate by offering creature comforts or other preferential treatment (which is, of course, standard operating procedure in police stations across the United States). 
   Worse, as my colleague Sen. John Cornyn of Texas pointed out at Gonzales' confirmation hearing last week: ""Because the convention prohibits the holding of detainees in isolation, Al Qaeda fighters would be able to coordinate with each other. And POW status even confers broad combat immunity against criminal prosecution before civilian and military tribunals alike. Surely no member of this committee actually believes that an Al Qaeda terrorist deserves to be treated better than an American citizen accused of a crime!"" 
   Mr. Gonzales has served well as White House counsel, and he clearly is competent to serve as Attorney General of the United States. He shouldn't be attacked for rendering correct legal advice to the President.

His plan to secure Baghdad offers a chance to recommit ourselves to victory and is more than just a 'military solution.'

  Experts agree that there is much more required for quality education than money. Nonetheless, the federal government is making a major investment to support state efforts to improve education. Since 1995, funding for the U.S. Department of Education has increased by nearly 150 percent, from $23 billion in 1996 to $57 billion in 2006. 
   In the past five years alone, there have been dramatic increases in education funding: a 40.1 percent ($6.97 billion) increase in No Child Left Behind Act funding; a 45.4 percent ($3.98 billion) increase for Title I grants for economically disadvantaged students; a 67 percent ($4.25 billion) increase for special education grants to states; a 400 percent increase for reading from $286 million in 2001 to $1.1 billion in 2005 (a 300 percent increase); and a 34 percent ($14.35 billion) increase in total federal education funding.  
   Of course, these monies must be aimed at achieving specific goals. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed to make sure that these federal funds are being dedicated to giving every child a quality education. Federally required testing will not only track averages, but also each child's progress. The object is to ensure that no children are left behind. 
   Responding to concerns that the additional resources were not being directed to school districts with growing populations of students, like those in Arizona, I worked with Senators from other rapidly growing states to include in the Act a provision directing the government to allot more Title I funds to high growth states. 
   Since the passage of No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, there have been clear results here in Arizona. This year, up to 98 percent of students with sufficient credits will pass the AIMS test and graduate from high school. This means that almost every Arizona student who strove to graduate this year was actually able to don the cap and gown and receive a diploma. It also means that our state will benefit from a new generation of young adults with the self-respect and values that come with successfully graduating. Many of these students will go on to our state's outstanding universities and become Arizona's next generation of leaders. 
   Things have also improved at the primary and elementary levels. In 2000, only 16 percent of fourth graders got a ""proficient"" score in math. By 2005, this number had almost doubled to 28 percent. Similarly, in 2000, only 20 percent of Arizona's eighth graders qualified as proficient in math. By 2005, this number had gradually climbed to 26. These numbers are still nowhere near respectable, but the direction they're going in is encouraging. 
   The trend shows that the accountability measures incorporated into No Child Left Behind are beginning to help Arizona's children. 
   The federal government has assisted college students for years. Since 1995, the amount a college student may borrow has been raised to historic levels, and the number of Pell Grants awarded to students has increased dramatically. Pell Grants will grow by $240 million and the number of recipients will increase by 59,000 to 5.3 million students. Funding for Pell Grants rose from $8.8 billion in 2001 to $13 billion in 2006. In 2006, the Department of Education expects to distribute over $77 billion in grants, loans, and other aid to over 10 million students. Recent legislation has also removed origination fees and costs from lenders, passing on the savings to students. And for those now entering school, keep in mind that the costs of student loans, including the interest accrued, are deferred until after graduation, and represent an investment in your future. 
   High quality public education is the key to America's success. It provides opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to compete with and overtake their more privileged peers. When the education system works properly, every child is able, through hard work and determination, to make his or her dreams of success become reality.

  Sen. Jon Kyl, along with Sen. John McCain, today re-introduced legislation that calls for a study to determine the feasibility and desirability of designating the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic or Historic Trail. An identical bill is slated to be introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Jim Kolbe, on behalf of the entire Arizona House delegation.  
   ""The Arizona Trail is highly deserving of consideration for national designation,"" Kyl said. A roller coaster ride through the wide range of ecological diversity in the state, the Trail corridor begins at the Coronado National Memorial on the U.S. Mexico Border, and winds some 800 miles, ending on the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip District on the Utah Border. ""As it connects these two points, the trail invites exploration of the state's most renowned mountains, canyons, deserts and forests, including the Grand Canyon and the Sonora Desert,"" Kyl said. ""This trail is unique in that it was developed to maximize the incorporation of already existing public trails into one continuous trail, to showcase some of the most spectacular scenery in the West."" 
   In 1968, Congress established the National Trails System to promote the preservation of historical resources and outdoor areas. National scenic and national historic trails may be designated only by an act of Congress. The first step toward national trail designation is the feasibility study process. 
   The Arizona Trail is maintained by a partnership of over 16 federal, state and local agencies, as well as numerous community and business organizations and countless volunteers. ""Authorizing this study and ultimately designating the Arizona Trail as a national trail will help streamline its management, boost tourism and recreation, and preserve a magnificent natural, cultural, historical experience of the American West,"" Kyl said. 
   The Arizona Trail Feasibility Study Act was first introduced a year ago, in the last session of Congress.

  You can't spend more than you make - just ask any American family on a budget.
   Families have to set priorities when spending the money they earn. If a family increases spending in one area of the budget, it limits spending in another, or risks going into debt. And, in order to pay off a debt, a family would normally cut back its spending to pay off the money it owes. These are simply common-sense, responsible principles. 
   Shouldn't the government then follow these principles when spending taxpayer dollars? Unfortunately, if the recently unveiled Democratic budget is any indication, the federal government has no plans to play by these rules.
   The proposed Democratic budget will spend billions of taxpayer dollars, even increasing spending at a time when the economy is slowing and the government must be ever-more careful with each dollar. Spending billions more in taxpayer money is the wrong medicine for an economy that is getting sick.
   At a time when Americans are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and pay for the rising costs of groceries and gasoline, 43 million American families will owe an additional $2,300 in taxes under the Democratic proposal. Eighteen million seniors will owe $2,200 more, and 27 million small businesses - the core of our job market and engine that drives our economy - will each be hit with an additional $4,100 on their tax bill, potentially forcing lay-offs and decreasing the number of available jobs on the market.
   The proposed Democratic budget increases federal spending by $22 billion over the President's request for 2009, and $211 billion over the next five years. The overall level of spending in this budget is actually understated because the Democrats raid the Social Security trust fund and spend $775 billion that would otherwise be used to pay for future retirement benefits.
   Instead of reducing the debt as promised, congressional Democrats intend to allow the national debt to climb by $2 trillion by 2013! That's more than $6,000 in extra debt for every American. Without any way of paying for these spending increases, Democrats are left with their old standby: raising taxes. By failing to extend the current tax rates, the Democratic budget would raise taxes by $1.2 trillion on 116 million Americans.
   The budget does, however, make room for $35 billion of so-called, ""economic stimulus,"" so that Congress can spend more on roads, home heating subsidies, and unemployment insurance. I believe these resources would be better utilized to actually help the economy by giving taxpayers more certainty about their taxes this year. Congress should extend expiring tax provisions such as the higher education deduction and extend current income tax rates. If one wants to help the economy, don't raise taxes.
   Last year, congressional Democrats crafted their first budget after a decade of minority status. That budget revealed the Democrats fiscal plan for the country: tax hikes and a spending free-for-all. This year, their proposed budget is more of the same. I'm going to fight the spending increases and tax hikes that threaten to take more money from hardworking American families and support more sensible alternatives.

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Last year, a majority in Congress, working closely with President Bush, acted decisively to lower taxes for all taxpayers and small businesses to stimulate growth and help create jobs. May 28 will mark the one-year anniversary of enactment of this important law, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. 
   Now, others in Congress, including Senator John Kerry, have called for repealing some or all of this tax relief. Have the tax cuts hurt our economic recovery? Some Democrats would have us think so. Twelve months of economic data since the tax cuts were enacted, however, tell a different story. 
   Consider: Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 8.2 percent in the third quarter of 2003, 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, and 4.2 percent in the first quarter of 2004. This is the fastest three-quarter growth rate in nearly two decades. At this pace, our economy would double in size in 13 years. 
   According to the payroll survey, 288,000 new jobs were created in April, preceded by 337,000 in March. Over 1.1 million new jobs have been created over the last eight months. In June of 2003, when the tax cuts went into effect, the national unemployment rate was 6.3 percent. Less than a year later, it has dropped 11 percent to 5.6 percent, which is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Last week, new jobless claims fell to 315,000 - the lowest level since before the 2000 election. 
   Congress lowered the tax rate on dividends from 39.6 percent to 15 percent last year in order to make dividend-paying stocks more valuable, and to induce companies to improve corporate governance and raise dividend payouts to shareholders. The return on this tax cut has been greater than even its most ardent supporters predicted. One year later, the stock market has risen (on average) by 25 percent, and, according to Thomas Smith, the president of Prescott Associates, companies have increased dividend payments to shareholders by 40 percent, reversing a two-decade decline. Companies that began paying dividends following the tax cut include Best Buy, MGM, and Microsoft; other companies like Citigroup and Nike dramatically increased their dividends-per-share. 
   Business investment - the area that has hesitated most in joining the economic recovery - is hesitating no longer. It has increased by seven percent or more in each of the last four quarters, and manufacturing activity has increased for 11 consecutive months. The causes are many. The dividends and capital gains tax cuts (capital gains taxes were reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent) made it much more attractive for investors to risk their hard-earned money in the markets, giving companies a needed infusion of capital to expand their businesses. Also, reducing individual tax rates encouraged people to work harder and longer and also gave people a greater ability to make purchases. Add to that record low interest rates and a strong housing market, and individuals and families have rarely been on a more sound economic footing. 
   Every economist I know agrees that last year's tax cuts have been instrumental in putting Americans back on the path to growth and prosperity. So when politicians say when they need more of your money so they can spend it - for your own good, of course - beware. Raising taxes would not just hurt upper-income taxpayers, it would also jeopardize continued economic growth, to the detriment of all taxpayers. None of us should want that.

  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded the final passage by the Senate of an $82.04 billion FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental bill that includes funding and new tools for the global war on terrorism as well as significant provisions to improve border enforcement.  
   Three major provisions from the Material Support to Terrorism Prohibition Improvements Act, which Kyl introduced earlier this year and reviewed in hearings before his Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, are in the supplemental: 
   * Section 103(a) bars entry into the United States for representatives and members of terrorist groups and aliens who have received military-type training from groups they knew were terrorist in nature. 
   * Section 105(a)(1) expands the deportation of such aliens who may already be in the United States. 
   * Section 103(d) makes clear that terrorist-alien deportation and exclusion provisions apply to terrorist activity that the alien engaged in before the enactment of the supplemental.
  ""In addition to these new tools for fighting terrorism, the border provisions of the supplemental will help strengthen the rule of law and improve homeland security against terrorist infiltration,"" Kyl said. 
   Passed by the House on Thursday, the bill includes significant new funding Kyl supported, including $635 million for increased border security, which will allow the hiring of 500 new border patrol agents, 50 immigration and Customs inspectors, 168 enforcement agents and detention officers, as well as 1,950 detention beds that will help prevent the release, for lack of a place to keep them, of those who should be deported. 
   Also included, as part of the House-passed Real ID Act, is a provision that states require proof of lawful presence in the United States for their driver's licenses to be accepted as identification for federal purposes, and that temporary licenses issued to foreign visitors expire when the visitor's visa expires 
   ""Enforcing the law and controlling the border are among the most critical domestic challenges we face in the war against terrorism,"" Kyl said. ""This funding will provide much needed help to the border and in the interior, but we're still a long way from achieving the kind of security we need.""

   ""We should recognize the economic successes we enjoy today are the result of the policies the Senate is set to extend in the tax reconciliation relief bill tomorrow,"" said Kyl. ""It's undeniable that the tax-relief policies we implemented in 2003 have contributed to record-level Treasury revenues, low unemployment rates, all-time stock market highs, and overall economic strength.""
   Government estimators had predicted that the reduction in capital gains tax rates enacted in 2003 would cost the federal government $27 billion in lost revenues for 2004, but the Congressional Budget Office now reports that the lower rates actually brought in an additional $26 billion in revenue. So instead of costing $27 billion, the lower rates made $26 billion for the U.S. Treasury.
   Since August 2003, the economy has created nearly 5.3 million jobs (138,000 new jobs in April alone). The economy has experienced 32 consecutive months of job growth and is creating better jobs in high-wage fields. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.7 percent - the lowest in nearly five years, and well below the averages of the last four decades.
   The nation's gross domestic product - the leading indicator of economic growth - grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. This follows the nation's economic growth rate of 3.5 percent in 2005 - the fastest rate of any major industrialized nation in the world.
   ""This week, the Dow Jones hit a six-year high,"" said Kyl. ""And now all eyes are watching the market to see whether the stock market will hit its highest level ever - it's nonsense to believe the tax policies in place have not helped our economy.

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Last year I introduced legislation that would make permanent all of the major sections of the USA Patriot Act that are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Last week, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged Congress to renew the act and provided a great deal of supportive evidence.  
   The most critical function of the act, which was passed in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, has been to break down the historical wall between traditional criminal and intelligence-related investigations. But it has also provided new and better legal tools to law enforcement agencies for wiretapping, executing search warrants, and in many other areas where previous law was either simply inadequate to begin with, or rendered obsolete by the nature of modern terrorism and technological advances like cell phones, voice mail and the Internet. 
   FBI Director Robert Mueller has repeatedly testified that the act's provisions have proven extraordinarily beneficial in the war on terrorism and have been directly responsible for many counterterrorism successes. Clinton Administration Attorney General Janet Reno agrees, stating publicly that ""everything that's been done in the Patriot Act has been helpful."" Still, there has been a considerable amount of criticism of the act from people who wonder whether its provisions might be abused. There is much misinformation about the act, particularly sections 213 and 215: 
   Section 213 of the Patriot Act codifies judicial common law, allowing investigators to delay giving notice to the target that a search warrant has been executed against his property if a court finds reasonable cause to believe that immediate notice may result in: endangering an individual; flight from prosecution; destruction of evidence; intimidation of potential witnesses; or if such notice would otherwise seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay a trial. Notice must still be provided ""within a reasonable period"" of the warrant's execution, though this period may be extended by the court for good cause. 
   The need for such authority is obvious: it allows investigators to uncover specific information about a terror suspect's activities or associates without tipping their hand. There would be no point in conducting a wiretap, for example, if the target had to be immediately informed that his conversations were being monitored. Likewise, if immediate notice were required after every kind of search, many suspects would flee the country, destroy computer files, alert associates, injure or kill witnesses, or simply accelerate a planned attack. 
   Although critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have called section 213 ""sneak and peek"" and decried it as a ""sea change"" in U.S. law, the reality is that the U.S. Supreme Court established 25 years ago that this procedure is constitutional, and has consistently reaffirmed this view. In fact, in a 1979 case, the Court specifically derided the argument that delayed-notice searches are unconstitutional as ""frivolous."" Perhaps one reason was that, according to the Justice Department, the most common period of delay of notice authorized has been a mere seven days. 
   Section 215 relates to subpoena authority for business records, extending to ""terrorism"" the types of crimes for which so-called business records can be sought. The law has always recognized that book store and library records are included. To obtain such rescords, a subpoena must be pre-approved by a judge, which means that the frequently-cited fear of ""the FBI investigating someone simply because of the books that he borrows from a library"" is false. As an added protection against abuse, the Patriot Act requires that the FBI ""fully inform"" the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on all use of such authority. Again, this authority is not new - federal investigators have long used the grand jury subpoena to obtain bookstore records. As the Washington Post noted in a September 11, 2003 editorial, investigative authority to review library records ""existed prior to the Patriot Act; the law extends it to national security investigations, which isn't unreasonable."" 
   Finding out whether a suspect checked out a book on bomb making is a reasonable investigative technique. Moreover, it has been well established that terrorists and spies - the September 11th hijackers, for example - have used libraries to plan and carry out activities that threaten U.S. national security, among other ways by using their Internet access to communicate by email. Given this reality, it would be foolish to place libraries and bookstores off-limits to investigations. 
   More broadly, given the demonstrated success of the Patriot Act in making us more secure, and the paucity of actual (as opposed to hypothetical) complaints of abuse, it would surely be unwise to start rescinding its major provisions.

KYL BACKS STEM-CELL RESEARCH WHILE PROTECTING HUMAN LIFE
  The Senate today approved two bills that expand stem-cell research, but one does so without destroying human life. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) voted for the bill that expands research within ethical limits.  
   S.30, the HOPE Act, was approved by the Senate 70 to 28 and directs the Department of Health and Human Services to seek out alternative sources of stem cells and to study the possibility of establishing an amniotic and placental stem-cell bank, similar to the bone marrow and cord blood stem-cell bank, while reaffirming a policy that prohibits research that destroys human life. 
   ""We live in an age when medical miracles occur every day, many of which are the result of stem-cell research,"" said Kyl. ""I favor the broadest possible effort to pursue promising medical technologies within appropriate ethical limits, and I believe the legislation authored by Senators Isakson and Coleman does exactly that. It builds on the research that is currently treating patients, and encourages the expansion of stem-cell research in a responsible way. 
   ""By contrast, I voted against the alternative bill introduced by Senator Reid, because I believe that taxpayers should not have to subsidize the destruction of human life, especially when a number of state governments and large universities have already directed significant resources to embryonic stem-cell research. On lines beyond those already authorized for federally-funded research, there are billions of dollars available for embryonic stem-cell research on lines from newly destroyed embryos, and increases in federal funding and a change in the federal policy are not necessary."" 
   S.5, Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, was also approved by the Senate 63 to 34 and is similar to legislation vetoed by the President in 2006. The bill overturns a key element of current policy by allowing taxpayer dollars to be used to subsidize the extraction of stem cells from the destruction of human embryos. 
   Both bills will now be sent to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.

  At the beginning of 2006, I wrote a column outlining some New Year's resolutions for Congress: enhancing border security, working to maintain lower tax rates, reauthorizing the Patriot Act to better go after terrorists, and helping to effectively implement the Medicare prescription drug program. With the 109th Congress coming to a close, now would be a good time to take a look back at the progress with these priorities. 
   ENHANCING BORDER SECURITY  
   Over the past two years, Congress approved legislation increasing the amount of federal dollars being dedicated to border security. We've funded an increase of 3,736 new border patrol agents (for a total of 14,555), additional surveillance equipment, roads and vehicle barriers, an increased number of detention spaces, and border fencing. While these resources will better help secure our borders, much work remains to be done, and it is my hope that the momentum that has been built will continue next year. 
   MAINTAINING LOW TAX RATES 
   The most recent statistics released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that Arizona is the fastest growing state (according to job growth and gross state product) in the country. In Arizona and nationwide, economists attribute the strength of the economy largely to the pro-growth tax policies of 2001 and 2003. 
   Almost two million Arizonans benefited from the lower tax rates enacted in 2003. Of this figure, more than 400,000 Arizonans benefited from the reduction of the capital gains and dividends tax rates (35 percent of Arizona's taxpayers who benefited had incomes of $50,000 or less); many of these were senior citizens, who rely on this investment income. 
   I spearheaded the successful effort this year to extend the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends through 2010, so that Americans can plan their investments with the certainty of knowing what the applicable tax rates will be. 
   KEEPING AMERICA SAFE 
   Congress continues to provide more tools to intelligence agents and prosecutors to fight terrorists. Earlier this year, Congress renewed the Patriot Act, which enhances the capability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to effectively combat terrorism. Legislation I drafted, the Tools to Fight Terrorism Act, supplements the Patriot Act by, among other things, authorizing foreign intelligence search warrants for monitoring suspected lone-wolf terrorists and making it a criminal and deportable offense to receive training at a terrorist training camp; punishing hoaxes perpetrated about terrorist crimes or the deaths of U.S. soldiers in wartime; and creating tough, mandatory penalties for possession of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or anti-aircraft missiles. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues next year to ensure that our intelligence and law enforcement officials have all the tools they need to investigate, stop, and punish terrorist conspiracies. 
   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM 
   This was also the year for implementation of the Medicare prescription drug program. While the roll-out experienced startup challenges, over 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are now receiving some form of comprehensive prescription drug coverage (over 500,000 Arizonans are enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan). It's important to remember that seniors didn't have any comprehensive prescription drug coverage before this year. 
   Also, due to strong competition, monthly premiums are lower than anticipated - the average premium is $24 in 2006, meaning beneficiaries save an average of over $1,100 per year. Robust competition combined with increased beneficiary choice has resulted in better health coverage options, lower prices, and reliable savings. 
   While I believe we can look back at the past year with some satisfaction over the progress Congress has made, there are still many major issues that remain unresolved. I look forward to returning in January to tackle many pending issues, such as immigration reform; and it is my hope that Congress will be able to work in a bipartisan way to accomplish what's necessary for America's future.

  The President recently unveiled his proposed budget for 2009. The budget proposal outlines the operating budget for the entire federal government. I will report to you on parts of the budget that particularly impact Arizona; and this week I'd like to concentrate on the proposed funding for the US Forest Service.
   The President has budgeted $4.109 billion for the Forest Service - a seven percent reduction from 2008 funding. There are significant cuts across the board; the most critical are the cuts to hazardous fuel reduction accounts (which the Forest Service has identified as its number one priority). These accounts are funded at $297 million, down from $310 million in 2008. 
   Fire-fighting expenses increase by $148 million to just under $1 billion. Last year, the Forest Service spent $1.4 billion fighting fires nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Interior Department spent an additional $450 million.
   With almost 48 percent of the proposed budget going toward fire fighting, the Forest Service might be more appropriately called the ""Fire Service.""
   I believe funding for fighting fires must be complemented by adequate funding for preventing them. Proactive management of our forests not only is the best tool in combating wildfires, it is critical to restoring forest health and improving habitats for diverse species.
   Typically, there are two complimentary methods of treatment: mechanical thinning of brush and smaller diameter trees, and prescribed burning. These treatments open up forests so they are less susceptible to ""hot"" crown fires. More importantly, reducing competition for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight immediately enhances the health of the trees, allowing them to grow bigger and fend off diseases and deadly insects like bark beetles.
   The 2006 ""February Fire"" that consumed over 4,000 acres of Tonto National Forest in Arizona highlights our ongoing struggle to adequately prepare for and expeditiously suppress wildfires. It also shows the need to significantly increase the amount of forest acres treated by mechanical thinning and prescribed burning. Had it not been for the previous treatments (and burned areas) in parts of the fire's path, the damage would have been far worse.
   I was pleased to see that this proposed budget includes funding for a pilot project with partners in the Southwest Ecosystem Restoration Institutes to develop and test prioritizing restoration-based fuel reduction treatments.
   In 2004, I helped draft legislation to create federally-recognized ecological restoration institutes (ERI) to demonstrate and promote the application of forest thinning and other tested treatments to lands at risk of severe wildfires. The Ecological Research Institute at Northern Arizona University received official federal recognition under this legislation, making it one of only three such institutes in the nation. Since the bill's enactment in 2004, I've been fighting to get ERI in the budget, so that Congress does not have to add the funding (we still have to ensure that Congressional appropriations bills include the President's budget request).
   As Arizona prepares to enter its wildfire season, it's critically important that the Forest Service has the resources to prevent wildfires before they happen. It's too bad we have to spend more money fighting fires than investing in ecological restoration, which could prevent fires and improve the forest at the same time. I will do what I can through the Congressional appropriations process to ensure that the Forest Service has the resources it needs to both fight and prevent forest fires, as well as carry out all its other important responsibilities.

  The U.S. House of Representatives today approved H.R. 4411, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2005, by a strong bipartisan vote of 317 to 93. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) applauded its passage, calling it an encouraging step toward significantly curbing gambling on the web.  
   ""A Harvard professor once appropriately likened Internet gambling to using crack cocaine,"" said Kyl. ""Gambling can be highly addictive, especially when it's done over an unregulated environment such as the Internet."" 
   The core of the House legislation is similar to the proposals that Kyl has championed. H.R. 4411 would require the U.S. Treasury Department to issue regulations that would prohibit approving a transaction between a U.S.-based customer account and an Internet gambling merchant. Financial institutions would have to follow those regulations.

   Many legal, governmental, and collegiate groups have endorsed efforts to combat gambling activity in cyberspace including the National Association of Attorneys General, which has expressed strong support. The Federal Trade Commission has also acknowledged the harms of Internet gambling and the National Collegiate Athletic Association is particularly concerned about the risks to college students and has urged a legislative remedy.

  Senators Lieberman, McCain, Kyl, Graham, and Coleman today introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Defense Authorization Act, confronting the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran over its proxy attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.  
   The amendment details the publicly available evidence put forward over the past year by General David Petraeus, commanding general of Multi-National Force Iraq, and others about Iran's violent and destabilizing activities in Iraq. 
   The amendment states that ""the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable act of hostility against the United States,"" and demands the government of Iran ""take immediate action"" to end all forms of support it is providing to Iraqi militias and insurgents. The amendment also mandates a regular report on Iran's anti-coalition activity in Iraq.

""This amendment is a common sense, common ground statement of the Senate to Tehran: we know what you are doing, and you must stop.""

""On my last trip to Iraq, our Minnesota troops in Southern Iraq showed me Iranian-made explosives that were used against them on convoy missions.

  The 110th Congress will define how each political party proposes to address health care reform. The debates over programs such as the Medicare drug plans or the State Children's Health Insurance Program boil down to a difference between those who want more affordable options for health care insurance or more government programs. The differences also involve more or less interference between physicians and patients. 
   There are a number of reasons health care is becoming more expensive: there are more and better treatments, tests, drugs and devices; people are living longer; and lawsuits against medical providers raise insurance rates. It also costs a lot to train health care professionals. And as the nation's fastest growing state, Arizona exemplifies the challenges ahead.  
   In the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) most recent analysis of state health workforce data, Arizona ranked 49th among states in per capita health services employment. HRSA estimates that Arizona only has 172 physicians per 100,000 people, well below the national average. 
   That same report also recognized that Arizona's population is projected to grow 18 percent between 2000 and 2020, and that the number of those 65 and older is projected to grow 72 percent. 
   In 2005, nearly 47 million people were uninsured nationwide. Arizona experienced one of the largest percentage increases in its uninsured population, reaching nearly one million Arizonans without health coverage. If left unchecked, these challenges will place an increasing financial burden on health care providers, federal and state governments, and taxpayers. 
   Earlier this year, in his State of the Union address, the President started the debate by proposing some bold health reform initiatives. The goal is to ensure access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The question is how? 
   The answer lies first in looking at what is working today. Rather than building a complex program for the government to provide prescription drugs to seniors, the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2004 expanded private health plan choices and competition in Medicare. It also emphasized prevention, disease management, patient safety, and quality, and made Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) more attractive, permanent, and available to all consumers. And, the MMA required more transparent accounting of Medicare's long-term liabilities. 
   Over 90 percent of those eligible have signed up and the program enjoys more than an 80 percent satisfaction rating. Costs have been reduced and there are many more choices than would exist in a purely government-run program. 
   Another answer starts by asking: what do patients want? The answer is access, affordability, quality, and individual choice and control without a lot of complexity or long waits. 
   Health Care America, a nonpartisan organization devoted to promoting access, choice, quality, innovation and competition in our health care system, recently released a national survey of 1,000 registered voters. The survey asked voters to consider a European-style health care system and asked them to rank tradeoffs (such as longer wait times and quality of service) as acceptable, unacceptable, or neutral. Voters ranked all tradeoffs as unacceptable. 
   What ranked as the most unacceptable tradeoffs? Longer wait times for doctor appointments and hospital procedures, a three-month waiting time between a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, and limited treatment options, such as an approved drug list. 
   I share the findings of this survey for two reasons. First, it confirms what we already know - patients want access to affordable health coverage. They want a doctor or hospital of their choice. And, they want the highest quality care. 
   Second, while Americans want more affordable coverage options, they are not asking their political leaders to abandon everything and start over. Americans' dissatisfaction with the current system does not signal a preference for a government-run health care system. In fact, the survey highlights that patients worry about an expanded government role and how it will affect the doctor-patient relationship and quality of care. 
   I support a consumer-driven, patient-focused health care system that harnesses the competitive market to lower costs, expands access to coverage, and maintains individual control over health care decisions. 
   The 110th Congress must make health care a priority. Among the reforms we should consider are small business health plans, medical liability reform, tax breaks for purchasing health insurance, and improved ways to save for future, long-term health care expenses.

  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, held a hearing today to explore the science behind ""Project Zebra"" - a project that could dramatically improve our nation's ability to detect and respond to a bio-terrorist attack.  
   ""Time can mean the difference between life and death when it comes to responding to a bio-terrorist attack,"" said Kyl. ""Today, health providers must rely on time-consuming methods before they can know if a patient is infected, and what they are dealing with. Project Zebra can make the difference in saving lives."" 
   When responding to a bio-terrorist incident, making a rapid diagnosis of potential infection is critical to determining the appropriate course of action. The concept proposed by Project Zebra could dramatically expedite diagnoses so that potential bio-terror threats are quickly communicated to the public. 
   Project Zebra refers to a collaborative, scientific research effort by leading scientists and universities - many of which are in Arizona - to create a genetic profile database of infectious agents along with a new diagnostic test that, together, will quickly determine the source of infection in patients. 
   Such a diagnostic test would compare a patient sample against known infectious agent signatures in the database. It would provide medical personnel an ability to distinguish between bio-terror agents and routine diseases. A diagnosis could potentially be made within an hour. Currently, it can take more than a day if a lab culture must be grown. 
   ""Scientific research being conducted in Arizona may someday provide doctors with a fast, new way to diagnose infections - whether they are terror-related or as simple as the common cold,"" said Kyl. 
   Kyl invited several distinguished witnesses to testify about the scientific research behind ""Project Zebra."" Witnesses included: Dr. Jeffery Trent is a leader in the field of genomic medicine and is considered a pioneer in the arena of functional genomics as applied to human diseases. He is president and scientific director of the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix, Arizona. Dr. Paul Keim is a leading expert in the field of pathogen genomics. He is a scientist with TGen and a faculty member at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Dr. Harvey Meislin is one of the most influential ER physicians in the nation and actively involved in emergency response training programs. He heads up the ER department at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Dr. David Relman is one the country's leaders in the field of gene expression profiling and infectious diseases. He serves on the faculty at Stanford Medical School and is a practicing physician with the VA.

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, both Congress and the Bush Administration examined the legal tools available to investigators and prosecutors in the fight against terrorism.  
   What we found was disturbing and in some cases appalling. Outdated restraints impaired law enforcement's ability to gather, analyze, and disseminate critical intelligence. Rules written in the era of rotary telephones were woefully inadequate against al Qaeda's exploitation of cell phones, voice mail and the Internet. Criminal penalties for terrorist violence were often more lenient than those for simple assault. It was even unclear whether providing expert advice and assistance to attackers - for example, helping to weaponize anthrax - was illegal. Local police could collect DNA samples from convicted burglars, but federal officials had no such authority for terrorists who might have bombed the same buildings. 
   Perhaps the worst problem was a set of formal and informal policies that prevented law enforcement agencies from sharing information with one another. FBI Director Robert Mueller described the impact that these information-sharing barriers had on investigations: 
   ""An [FBI] agent investigating the intelligence side of a terrorism case was barred from discussing the case with an agent across the hall who was working the criminal side of that same investigation. For instance, if a court-ordered criminal wiretap turned up intelligence information, the criminal investigator could not share that information with the intelligence investigator - he could not even suggest that the intelligence investigator should seek a wiretap to collect the information for himself."" The Patriot Act was written to resolve these kinds of problems and provide law enforcement and intelligence agencies the new tools they need to fight a new adversary. Among other provisions, it streamlined the process for obtaining search warrants in multiple jurisdictions, making it easier to track suspects who are constantly on the move. And it raised criminal penalties for not only perpetrating, planning and otherwise abetting attacks, but also for hoaxes that can cause nearly as much economic damage. 
   Since the Act became law on October 26, 2001 - six weeks after the fall of the Twin Towers - four different terrorist cells have been broken up in the United States alone, in Buffalo, Detroit, Seattle, and Portland. As of May 5, 2004, the Justice Department had charged 310 defendants with criminal offenses as a result of post-9/11 terrorism investigations, and more than half have already been convicted. Praise for the Patriot Act has come not only from those like FBI Director Robert Mueller, from whom it might be expected, but also the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, and even former Clinton administration Attorney General Janet Reno, who said ""everything that's been done in the Patriot Act has been helpful."" 
   Not that there aren't critics, notably the American Civil Liberties Union and some other activist groups. But the Patriot Act was carefully crafted to guarantee protection for civil liberties, and is subject to ample oversight. A report filed in January by the inspector general of the Justice Department - an appointee of President Clinton - found no incidents in which the Patriot Act was used to abuse civil rights or civil liberties. 
   Even so, a bill has been introduced in Congress that would take away many of the Patriot Act's most important tools, including wiretaps on all phones used by suspects who change them repeatedly to avoid surveillance, and subpoena power for businesses, even though such authority exists for other criminal investigations, like drug trafficking and health care fraud. This is the provision that would allow law enforcement agencies to obtain library records such as the books checked out by the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. Repealing it would truly be a step backward, as we know that the 9/11 hijackers used library computers to coordinate their attack via email. 
   Sixteen critical provisions of the Patriot Act are due to expire at the end of next year. It is important that they be renewed. In fact, it's hard to think of a higher priority.

  Sen. Jon Kyl applauded the Senate's approval, under unanimous consent, of legislation yesterday that would settle claims over Indian water rights and allow the U.S. and Arizona to settle repayments owed to the federal government for construction of the Central Arizona Project (CAP).

   The settlement will bring long-sought certainty to cities and communities as they plan their growth and development, as well as provide a means for Indian tribes to actually use water rights that thus far exist only on paper. It is a major component of a long-term water plan for Arizona, and also resolves a long-running dispute between the state and the federal government over nearly $2 billion in repayments for construction of the Central Arizona Project."" 
   The ""Arizona Water Settlements Act"" (S. 437), co-sponsored with Senator John McCain, is divided into four titles. The first resolves the repayment issue and the allocation of CAP water between state and federal interests and creates a funding mechanism for current and future Indian water settlements. The second resolves claims by the Gila River Indian Community, and the third amends the 1982 ""Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement Act,"" resolving claims by the Tohono O'odham Nation. The fourth title concerns separate issues involving the San Carlos Apache tribe. Companion legislation was introduced in the House by U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) with bipartisan support from the Arizona delegation. 
   ""The water users and providers of Arizona have waited a long time for this day. Virtually every major water user and provider in central Arizona has devoted itself to the passage of this bill,"" Kyl said. ""Looking ahead, this bill could ultimately be nearly as important to Arizona's future as was the authorization of the Central Arizona Project itself.""

  The Senate yesterday approved legislation co-sponsored by Arizona Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain that would expand Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park to protect ""some of the most unique natural and cultural resources contained anywhere in the world.""  
   ""No where else can you glimpse the fossil remains of an ancient wilderness ecosystem as it existed 30 million years ago,"" Kyl said. ""Today we know that petrified wood is only a part of the globally significant record contained in the rock formation commonly known as the 'Chinle Escarpment' which cuts across the park."" Scientists have found numerous paleontological deposits and nationally significant archeological sites, including ancient Pueblo cultural settings, in the escarpment, which also constitutes the best known record of Triassic period terrestrial ecosystems. However, only six miles of the 22-mile escarpment are within park boundaries. 
   H.R. 1630, to which the House gave initial approval on October 4, would expand the park to include an additional 120,000 acres of checker boarded federal, state, and private lands to protect against theft of petrified wood and fossils, pot hunting, vandalism to petroglyph sites and the environmental degradation caused by mineral exploration. Nearly ten years in the making, the expansion is supported by the private landowners, local communities, scientific and research institutions, state tourism agencies, and environmental groups. 
   Recently testifying in favor of the bill were Mike Fitzgerald, one of four landowners with property within the park expansion boundary, and Dr. David Gillette of the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, who spoke on behalf of 10 organizations including the museum, Chamber of Commerce and the National Parks Conservation Association. 
   Final action by the House is expected when it reconvenes to complete legislative business for the year.

This is why we must make permanent both the reduced rates for dividends and capital gains and the elimination of the death tax."" 
   Kyl criticized proposals to raise taxes on dividends, capital gains, and on estates as exactly the wrong action to take. ""Higher taxes on capital accumulation and their detrimental effects on our economy are something that we simply cannot afford,"" said Kyl.

  The President recently gave a series of speeches about the serious threat we face from radical Islamic terrorists. On the observance of the fifth anniversary of 9/11, it is fitting that we recall the nature of the enemy we face and what will be necessary for us to prevail in what is bound to be a long and difficult struggle. 
   It was important for the President to define who the enemy is and to make it clear that we are not just fighting terrorism itself, but the people who commit terrorism. We could have just as easily called the war in the Pacific during World War II ""the war on kamikaze terrorism."" That, too, was a suicide tactic by absolutely driven people. But it was the people, not the tactic of war we were fighting. The conflicts of 1941-45 and, thereafter, were against those whole believed in Nazism, fascism, Japanese imperialism, and, later, communism. They were not against a tactic, but against people who fought in the name of evil ideologies.  
   The same thing is true today. It is important to define the nature of the enemy we face in order to be able to adequately confront that enemy. That is why the President drew a comparison between the adversaries of then and now. He spoke of Adolf Hitler and people's initial tendency not to take him seriously. At first, Hitler was a ""crazy paper hanger"" and was greatly underestimated. Then, for a time, influential voices said that this was a man who could be appeased. This was understandable, in a sense, because the devastation of World War I was so fresh in everyone's mind that war was to be avoided at all costs. But Nazism and Hitler had to be confronted. 
   With communism, it was similar. At first it was ""Uncle Joe Stalin,"" who helped us defeat the Nazi threat. As soon as that was accomplished, though, we moved into the period of the Berlin blockade, the Russians' acquisition of the atomic bomb, and the Soviet coup against the democratic government of Czechoslovakia. It gradually became clear that communism was a danger for the United States and the free world. Eventually, when Americans understood, they committed themselves and their allies to winning a cold war to defeat that threat. 
   Granted, there is a difference between the Soviets of the communist era and the radical Islamists: the Soviets could be deterred, the radical Islamists can't. And there is a particular reason why. Unlike most who were under the sway of Marx and Lenin, the radical Islamists aren't rational about life itself. They seek to bend us to their will, to kill us, or die trying. Either way, in their view, they win. 
   What did Fox News journalists Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig have to do before they were released in Gaza a couple of weeks ago? They had to bend to the will of Allah. They were coerced to convert to Islam before they were released. This is the jihadists' goal. It is to force the rest of the world (including other Muslims) to adhere to their illegitimate version of Islam; to kill those who resist; or to die in the effort to bring death to those who resist. 
   We will only win this war if we take the threat seriously. The sooner we commit to victory, the fewer our losses will be. The best strategy is to take the fight to the enemy. The worst strategy is to leave in the middle of a battle, for example, in Iraq. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to win the war if we abdicate that battle. What war ally will stand with us if we decide there that the fight is too tough? How would that help us influence the mullahs who rule in Iran? 
   The President said, as he has said before, that the road ahead is going to be difficult. It will require more sacrifice. Yet we can have confidence in the outcome, because we've seen freedom conquer tyranny and terror before. 
   This war will not be won by exaggerating partisan differences. It will not be won by deciding that the fight is too difficult and that there are places where this struggle is occurring where we cannot prevail. We cannot send a message to our enemies, let alone to our allies, that we are not up to the struggle, wherever it may break out. 
   The only way to win this struggle is to win it.

KYL, CORNYN INTEND TO INTRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE BORDER, IMMIGRATION REFORM
  Sens. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and John Cornyn (R-TX) today announced their intention to introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would address border security as well as the economic and political realities that have drawn millions of illegal aliens into the United States and continue to attract more. Both cautioned, however, against attempts to attach immigration-related amendments to the pending Iraq supplemental appropriation.  
   ""What the nation's immigration system needs most is a commitment to enforce the law,"" Kyl said. ""That means not just more resources, but also the will to enforce the law."" 
   Kyl and Cornyn expressed support in separate floor statements for the basic principle, outlined by President Bush, of an enforceable temporary worker program. But Kyl strongly emphasized that such a proposal should not be confused with any form of ""amnesty"" that rewards illegal behavior. ""We have to start at the border - provide the resources to enforce the law there, particularly against the new threat of terrorist infiltration - and then follow up with a credible system of worker eligibility verification enabling employers to confirm they are not hiring illegal immigrants,"" he said. ""Where there is a need for more labor, we can create a better system for hiring temporary workers - but it all needs to be done within the law."" 
   Kyl chairs the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology & Homeland Security, and Cornyn chairs the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security & Citizenship. The subcommittees have already held a joint on hearing border security and are scheduled to hold another on interior enforcement on Thursday. Several more will follow, exploring various aspects of the problem. 
   ""Much damage has already been done to the notion of respect for the rule of law and to our national security by our failure to pass serious immigration reform,"" Kyl said. ""We need to do it this year; and by giving employers better options for hiring temporary workers, we can eliminate the magnet of illegal employment that is drawing so many poorer people from other countries to illegally come to the United States.""

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Even after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, and the resulting spike in the cost of energy, the U.S. economy is doing remarkably well by virtually every statistical measure. So why, one might wonder, do we so often see negative headlines in the news?  
   Consider some data released last week: 
   * More than 215,000 jobs were created in November, and 4.5 million since May of 2003. ""To put the November increase in perspective,"" noted Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""from January through August of this year, payroll employment growth averaged 196,000 per month""; 
   * The nation's unemployment rate, at 5 percent, is stable and lower than the average of the 1970s, '80s and '90s; 
   * Gross Domestic Product for the 3rd quarter was higher than expected - 4.3 percent - and has been growing near that average for more than two years; 
   * Sales of new homes reached an all-time high in October, as is minority ownership; and 
   * According to the Department of Labor, the productivity of American workers rose at an annual rate of 4.7 percent over the summer. Productivity is the key to raising living standards, as increases allow employers to compensate their workers more without having to raise the price of the products they sell (which would fuel inflation).
   So why, in the face of all this good news, is there negative public sentiment about the state of the economy? Consumers have been concerned about gas prices, but they are going down. Another reason may be the skyrocketing cost of health care. Overall, worker compensation has grown along with other indicators. But for many Americans, that hasn't translated into a big increase in take-home pay, because much of the extra compensation is in the form of more costly health insurance. If a worker gets a 4% raise next year - and earns the national median weekly wage - health care costs will eat up 28% of the raise. 
   Fortunately, President Bush has developed a comprehensive health care agenda and has called on Congress to pass association health plans, so small businesses can purchase insurance at the same discounts as big companies. Other proposals would expand the development of health information technology. Because too many doctors are being sued out of business, it's imperative that Congress also pass national medical liability reform. More broadly, Health Savings Accounts will provide patients with greater say in decisions regarding their own health care. 
   The federal government must also continue the policies that have created our current economic growth. That includes a continuation of the lower tax rates that helped fuel the economic expansion. Armed with the conviction that the economy grows when people are allowed to keep more of their own money, Congress and the President responded to the economic slowdown at the start of the decade with pro-growth tax cuts for families, investors, and small businesses. 
   Despite the criticism of those whose definition of ""fiscal responsibility"" is to raise taxes, last week's data make clear that these cuts worked, even better than expected. By spurring economic growth, they've even increased revenue to the federal government enough that (despite too much federal spending) we remain on track to reach the goal of cutting the budget deficit in half by 2009. 
   More importantly, they've helped America weather a very difficult five years, during which we've been hit with a stock market decline, recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, high energy costs, and devastating natural disasters. History is replete with examples of even some such events sparking massive economic calamities. Instead, we're charging ahead with a growth rate that remains the envy of the world. If we have a crisis, it's only one of confidence, which is perhaps understandable in a time of war, but is certainly in contradiction to the real state of the economy.

  The President's plan for success in Iraq should be given a chance. Although critics have focused almost exclusively on the reinforcement of troops - the so-called ""surge"" - the President's strategy is a comprehensive approach to the security and political problems facing Iraq. Under this plan, the Iraqi government has committed to lead the effort to defeat the militias and any other challenges to the government's monopoly on force. The new plan also relies on political and economic measures that will help to create a more unified government capable of providing essential services to its citizens.  
   Opponents do not agree that a political solution depends on peace and stability in Iraq. But, as General Petraeus made clear in his Senate testimony in January, Iraqis need to feel that the government is capable of providing for their security before they can give up their reliance on sectarian militias. 
   While American troops work with Iraqi units to establish security in Baghdad, and in the al Qaeda-dominated al Anbar province, the Iraqi government will be expected to act on promised reconciliation initiatives, including an oil-sharing compact, revision of the de-Baathification law, provisional elections, and to reform its cabinet to ensure the equal treatment and delivery of services to all of Iraq's communities. 
   The new plan is not guaranteed to work. But everyone agrees Iraq cannot yet handle security by itself. If the U.S. withdraws, Iraqis will be slaughtered, terrorists will be emboldened throughout the region, and Iran and Syria will step into the void. These severe consequences to our national security make it clear that withdrawal is not an option. 
   Although many have summarily criticized the new strategy, they have contributed no viable plan of their own. No one has any illusions about the challenges we face, but we will be more likely to succeed if we are unified. As Osama Bin Laden has said, ""This war is for you or for us to win. If we win, it means your defeat and disgrace forever."" 
   The Senate should also consider the message a nonbinding, no-confidence resolution would send to our enemies, our allies, and our troops. Such a resolution would tell General Petraeus, whom the Senate recently confirmed as U.S. commander in Iraq, that we don't support his mission. During an interview with an evening news broadcast, Tyler Johnson, a 21-year-old soldier serving in Iraq, appropriately summed up the message a no-confidence resolution would have on our forces: ""Those people are dying. You know what I'm saying? You may support - Oh, we support the troops,' but you're not supporting what they do, what they share and sweat for, what they believe for, what we die for. It just don't make sense to me.""

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   It's easy to become jaded and cynical working in Washington, DC. That's why I so much enjoyed spending the Fourth of July weekend in Show Low, Springerville and Greer, Arizona. As my son remarked after a barbecue, ""I can't believe the difference between the talking heads in Washington and these real people."" 
   While professional politicos are consumed with an election that is four months away, mired in angst over Iraq and endlessly arguing over the strength of the economic recovery, the people I talked to in the White Mountains area were full of typical straightforward American optimism about the future. Many said their biggest concern, in fact, was the extent to which political naysayers have managed to sow seeds of self-doubt about our economic recovery and the war on terrorism. FDR's immortal declaration that ""we have nothing to fear but fear itself"" springs to mind.
   I was honored to speak at a Fourth of July ceremony at which veterans of several wars joined in a 200-year-old national tradition, taking turns ringing a bell at exactly 11 a.m., the same time as a larger annual event at the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It was a profoundly moving experience, which I concluded with these remarks:
   ""Shortly before his death in 1826, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to a man named Roger Weightman in which Jefferson explained the reasoning behind the Declaration of Independence. The letter states: ""All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddle on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God. These are the grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.""
   Our annual observation of Independence Day should include reflection upon two critical truths, lest we lose sight of them.
   First, an acknowledgment of what we as Americans must do to preserve our rights for ourselves and future generations. Freedom is not free; and that means more than being willing to go to war. In some ways, it is even harder to remain focused in good times on the need to preserve our freedoms by resisting the temptation to give ever more power to government - to do for us what we could do for ourselves. As Barry Goldwater reminded us, a government powerful enough to take care of us is a government powerful enough to take our rights from us. I believe Jefferson, Adams, and the rest of the founding fathers would be shocked and concerned about the amount of power we have ceded to the federal government - and the degree of diminishment of our freedoms as a result.
   The second reason to refresh our recollection of the ringing words of the declaration is because, as Jefferson wrote, ""Here are grounds of hope for others."" Our attention these days has shifted from the captive nations of the Soviet empire to the millions who would be ruled by the totalitarian force of radical Islam, and the hopes and aspirations of the free people of Afghanistan and Iraq. No less than the Nazis or Communists, the terrorists of radical Islam have engaged us in a fight to the finish, whether we recognize it or not. It is the challenge of this - our - generation to commit ourselves, no less than did our founders, to victory. Our enemies would not disagree with Thomas Paine's formulation: that we will have either liberty or death - there is no middle ground in our current struggle.
   So on this glorious day, let us refresh our recollections of our rights, the source of those rights and the sacrifice others have made to preserve them - and to rededicate ourselves to do our duty as God would have us do it to protect his gift of these rights to us.

  It is all too rare the media reports good news from Iraq; but the world recently witnessed a series of events that were too positive for even the most cynical reporters to spin or ignore. In the most celebrated instance, coalition forces, in close coordination with Iraqi and Jordanian intelligence, were able to locate and kill the Iraqi leader of al Qaeda, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi. And on the very same day, the new Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki named the final two members of his cabinet, putting his nation on the road to democratic stability.  
   Zarqawi was among the vilest terrorists the world has ever known and was dedicated to fanning the flames of sectarian violence in Iraq, preventing the emergence of a unified, democratic nation there, and killing as many American troops as possible along the way. As coined by Osama Bin Laden, Zarqawi was ""the prince of al Qaeda in Iraq,"" and his death strikes at the very heart of the terrorist network. It is a positive step toward victory in the war on terror, a defeat for insurgents, and brings Iraq one step closer to accomplishing its goal of being a free and democratic nation, unfettered by the threat of terrorism. With Zarqawi's leadership now absent, I am hopeful that the insurgency in Iraq will be less effective, and pose less of a danger to American troops and innocent Iraqis. 
   But hunting down and killing terrorists will not be enough to build a free Iraqi nation; the Iraqis must also create a functioning government that represents the will of all Iraqi people. 
   A major step in the right direction was taken when Prime Minister Maliki nominated, and the parliament confirmed, officials for the key posts of Ministers of Defense and Interior. This progress should be heartening to all those who wish to see a stable, secure, democratic Iraq. 
   Our work in Iraq is far from over and we must now capitalize on this momentum by recommitting ourselves to victory there. Our military men and women, and the Iraqi people, need to know that we will not give up on them after the sacrifices they've made. A Marine stationed in Fallujah recently wrote a letter to his hometown paper in Ridgefield, Connecticut, expressing what must be the view of many of his comrades in arms: 
   ""In Fallujah, the people watch Al Jazeerah. However, they also watch CNN. A lot of them fear that the United States will soon cut and run. ?Furthermore, they know that the insurgents will not end their efforts early?Therefore, if they help us, their lives and the lives of their loved ones will be in great jeopardy the minute we leave - if we don't finish the job. Much that they see on American television leads them to believe that we intend to abandon our efforts before the new Iraqi government is capable of defending itself and its citizens.""
   We have the finest military in the world, and each and every American should be proud of the job our fighting men and women are doing under grueling circumstances in Iraq. The death of Zarqawi, and the completion of the Iraqi cabinet, are both testaments to the progress being made in that country. Our troops need and deserve their country to stand united behind them, now more than ever.

  We live in an age when medical miracles are occurring every day, many right at home in Arizona. Breakthroughs have treated and cured children and adults who could have died from their diseases just a few years ago. And some of these cures and treatments are the result of stem-cell research. 
   For example, thanks to the Cord Blood Registry located in Tucson, children and adults are being treated, and often cured, of once terminal diseases such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, cerebral palsy, and sickle-cell anemia. And these are just a handful of the 72 diseases that are either undergoing clinic trials or are already being treated and cured with stem cells obtained from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood.  
   With respect to stem-cell research, I favor the broadest possible effort to pursue promising medical technologies within appropriate ethical limits. Scientists have derived stem cells from two principle sources: the tissues, fluids, and organs of adults, and cells from human embryos. Human embryonic stem cells have only been obtained through a process that destroys the embryo. 
   In the past three decades, adult stem-cell research has led to the development and approval of treatments for a number of conditions. Recently, Congress passed legislation to spur additional advances by establishing an infrastructure to facilitate the collection and dissemination of two of the most promising categories of adult stem cells: those derived from bone marrow and those derived from umbilical cord blood. 
   By contrast, embryonic stem-cell experiments have not yielded any treatments for human patients. Nevertheless, researchers believe there is much potential there, so a great deal of private and public money has been raised to pursue it. 
   In 2001, the President issued an Executive Order that made available for the first time federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research using embryos already destroyed. In the subsequent six years, the federal government has spent more than $130 million on this type of stem-cell research and has spent more than $2.5 billion on all stem cell-related research. 
   In 2006, the Senate considered legislation that would have overturned a key element of the current policy: the stipulation that federal taxpayers' money cannot provide an incentive for the further destruction of human embryos. While this bill was approved, it was later vetoed by the President. 
   I voted against this legislation because I believe that taxpayers should not have to subsidize the destruction of nascent human life, especially when a number of state governments and large universities have directed significant resources to embryonic stem-cell research. Since there are already billions of dollars available to do embryonic stem-cell research on lines from newly destroyed embryos, increases in federal funding and a change in the federal policy are not necessary. Recently, the House of Representatives passed the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, a bill identical to the one President Bush vetoed last year. 
   The Senate will be considering its own similar version soon, and I will oppose it if it provides federal funding for research that destroys human life. 
   There is an alternative bill that is currently being developed by Senators Norm Coleman and Johnny Isakson that I would support. It would expand stem-cell research beyond bone marrow and umbilical cord blood, but would reaffirm a policy that prohibits research that destroys human life. 
   A recent study conducted by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine promisingly resulted in scientists harvesting stem cells from amniotic fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds a baby before it is born. These amniotic stem cells offer many of the benefits found in embryonic stem cells, and without its ethical complications, demonstrating just how much faster science is moving than politics. 
   Researchers found many promising developments. Amniotic-fluid stem cells proved successful in producing bone, heart muscles, fat, nerve, and liver tissues. All of this was possible without destroying the nascent life in an embryo. 
   We call all agree: stem cell research holds promise and has already provided life-saving treatments and cures. And we should continue to support that research within appropriate ethical restrictions.

KYL ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION HEARING OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Hearing on the Nomination of John G. Roberts to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: 
   Sen. Jon Kyl's Opening Statement:
   Before discussing Judge Roberts's nomination, I would like to take a moment to express my respect and admiration for the Justice whom he will be replacing on the Supreme Court: William Rehnquist, who began his career as a lawyer in Phoenix. From 1994 until last year, he made an annual return to Arizona to teach a course on Supreme Court history at the University of Arizona College of Law, my alma mater. Chief Justice Rehnquist provided steady leadership at the Supreme Court through several turbulent decades, showing in the process how much of a difference one person of great integrity can make. We all mourn his loss.  
   In spite of the fact that he is not from Arizona, Judge Roberts clearly is eminently qualified to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Enough has been said already about his credentials that I will not catalogue them again here. I will simply note one recent mark of distinction that Judge Roberts has received - the American Bar Association unanimously gave Judge Roberts its highest rating: ""well qualified."" And, according to the ABA, its committee evaluates not just the nominee's professional qualifications and legal abilities, but also his judicial temperament, including such personal qualities as the nominee's ""compassion, decisiveness, open-mindedness, courtesy, patience, freedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice under law."" 
   The principal matter that I would like to address today, at the beginning of our hearings on Judge Roberts's nomination, is the proper scope of this committee's questioning of this nominee. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues, a seat on the Supreme Court is not a political, let alone, a legislative office, and not every question that a Senator might think up is legitimate. This committee's precedents, the rules of judicial ethics, and a sound respect for the unique role of the federal judiciary in our society all counsel in favor of some basic limits on the types of questions that a Senator should ask of a judicial nominee. One is not qualified for the Court by virtue of his position on issues, but rather by his ability to judge fairly. 
   Most importantly, it is not appropriate for a Senator to demand a nominee's views on the issues that are likely to come before him on the court. This standard was reiterated four years ago by the late Lloyd Cutler, White House counsel to former Democratic Presidents Carter and Clinton. In a hearing before this committee on the subject of the Senate's role in evaluating judicial nominees, Mr. Cutler stated quite clearly what the proper limits are: ""Reviewers must refrain from asking candidates for particular pre-commitments about unresolved cases or issues that may come before them as judges."" Mr. Cutler continued: 
   The ultimate question is simply whether or not potential candidates have the qualities of integrity, good judgment and experience to become judicial officers of the United States . [I]t would be a tragic development if ideology became an increasingly important consideration in the future. To make ideology an issue in the confirmation process is to suggest that the legal process is and should be a political one. That is not only wrong as a matter of political science; it also serves to weaken public confidence in the courts.
  Just imagine expecting litigants to appear before a court knowing in advance what its ruling will be. 
   Limits on the questioning of judicial nominees are reflected even in the questionnaire that this committee submits to the nominee. Question 27(b) of the committee's questionnaire makes clear that it is unacceptable for anyone involved in the process of selecting the nominee to seek assurances about his positions on cases, questions, or issues that might come before him as a judge. [ Specifically, it says: Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nominee (including but not limited to any member of the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the Senate or its staff) discussed with you any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue, or question? (Emphasis added.) ] 
   Since Judge Roberts answered ""no,"" it would be ironic indeed if this committee were now to demand that the nominee take stands on questions that may come before him on the Court. 
   [The confirmation hearings of the two most recent nominees - Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, both of whom had hearings under then-Chairman Biden - are illustrative: 
   * In 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, refused to answer some of the questions that Senators posed to her. She told this committee: ""I must avoid giving any forecast or hint about how I might decide a question I have not yet addressed."" She also testified: ""Because I am and hope to continue to be a judge, it would be wrong for me to say or to preview in this legislative chamber how I would cast my vote on questions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide."" 
   * In 1994, Stephen Breyer testified: ""I do not want to predict or to commit myself on an open issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court."" He explained that nominees must help preserve the independence of the courts, and that ""it is so important that the client and the lawyers understand the judges are really open-minded."" Justice Breyer then refused to answer a wide variety of questions posed to him by Senators. 
   * I might add that when then-Chairman Biden presided over the confirmation hearing of Justice Ginsburg, President Clinton's first nominee to the Supreme Court, he advised the judge that ""you not only have a right to choose what you will answer and not answer, but in my view you should not answer a question of what your view will be on an issue that clearly is going to come before the Court."" ]
   Not only would it violate this committee's standards and precedents for a nominee to answer questions about issues that may come before him as a judge; it also would be unethical for the nominee to answer such questions. Some Senators have argued that nominees cannot talk about cases but that they can still talk about issues. The code of judicial ethics draws no such distinctions. The American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct dictates that 
   [a] judge or a candidate for election or appointment to judicial office shall not with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office . 
  The import of this ethical rule is unambiguous. If a nominee is asked to commit himself to a particular stance on an issue that is likely to come before him as a judge, that nominee is obligated to decline to answer that question. Any other approach would violate the Code of Judicial Conduct. 
   Judge Roberts, I expect you to adhere to the Code of Judicial Ethics; and I want you to know that I will defend your refusal to answer any question that you believe to be improper. 
   I also would like to emphasize that the standards for questioning that apply in this committee are not simply quaint relics of the past, to be abandoned at no cost to the future. Rather, these rules are fundamental to preserving the nature and role of an independent judiciary. 
   A judicial nominations process that required candidates to make a series of specific commitments in order to navigate the maze of Senate confirmation would undermine the very concept of a fair and independent judiciary. Constitutional law would become a mere extension of politics, but in a less accountable and less democratic arena. If the Supreme Court operated this way - if it simply enforced political commitments made during the confirmation process - why would we give it the power of judicial review, the power to strike down laws made by other, more accountable and democratic branches of the government? 
   Granting this kind of power to the Supreme Court - the power to override democratic majorities - makes sense only if what the court is doing is applying and upholding the rule of law and our Constitution. When the court adheres to that neutral or unbiased role, rather than making policy like the other branches, it is enforcing principles that the people themselves have deemed so important that they should be installed in the constitutional firmament, and placed above the reach of transient majorities or the political compromises reached by elected representatives. [The court can legitimately bind elected governments to these principles because it is the people themselves who, when they adopted the U.S. Constitution or one of its amendments, agreed to bind themselves to these principles.] The court's legitimate authority derives not from commitments made during confirmation, but from its obligations embodied in the Constitution. 
   I raise this matter not to suggest that all questions about a nominee's understanding of the law are improper. Indeed, I think that an examination of the court's role and the source of legitimacy of its authority reinforces the importance of inquiring into a nominee's judicial philosophy - of determining whether he is devoted to upholding and enforcing the laws and the Constitution as they were adopted by the people. Our proper role this week is to determine whether Judge Roberts has the character, the legal ability, and the judicial philosophy to fulfill that responsibility.

  Enforcing our immigration laws and maintaining secure borders is the job of the federal government, and the American people want Congress to act. But because the federal government has failed to meet its responsibility of enforcing the law and securing the border, the American people are understandably frustrated and do not trust the government to deal with the problem of illegal immigration. If Senators learned anything from the recent debate of immigration reform, it's that the American people want the federal government to enforce the law.  
   And yet, during that debate, I pointed out that enforcing the law also had to include changing some of the existing laws (because they aren't enforceable as written) and adding stronger ones. I recently introduced the Immigration Enforcement and Border Security Act of 2007, which includes roughly 72 changes in existing law to provide better enforcement against illegal immigration. 
   The first thing this legislation does is speed up the control of the border by adding surveillance technology and enhancements to physical infrastructure, including checkpoints, roads, vehicle barriers, and fencing. Under this bill, DHS could not build any less than 700 miles of fencing on the southern border, and 370 miles must be completed by the end of next year. 
   Next, this bill would authorize 6,000 National Guardsmen to remain at the southern border and, over the next six years, add 14,000 new agents to the Border Patrol. 
   Security at the border, however, is not enough to stem the problem of illegal immigration. Procedures should also be in place to prevent those who come here legally from staying illegally. 
   This legislation will expand criminal penalties against aliens who knowingly overstay their visas, and provide that those who overstay their visas by 30 days can be detained. And, once a nonimmigrant alien overstays his visa, this legislation would stipulate that all visas in his possession are void. If he wishes to return to the U.S., he would have to leave this country and undergo additional screenings at consulates abroad. 
   For aliens who entered this country illegally, criminal penalties would also be expanded. 
   Another aspect of interior enforcement is workplace enforcement. The current law does not work well, among other things, because documents used to establish identity are easily counterfeited. 
   This legislation works to ensure employers can easily and accurately identify those workers who are lawful. Violating the law and knowingly hiring illegal immigrants could result in civil penalties ranging from $5,000 to $75,000 per illegal immigrant hired and criminal penalties of up to $75,000 and six months imprisonment for employers. 
   A new Employment Eligibility Verification System is established to certify the eligibility of workers by verifying electronically their Social Security numbers through the Social Security Administration and DHS and improving identity verification. 
   The debate we had a few weeks ago on immigration reform should not deter us from doing what is needed to secure our borders and reduce illegal immigration. By doing nothing, we are tacitly endorsing the status quo, which is unacceptable. By fixing the enforcement laws that are broken, Congress can demonstrate to the American people that their government is willing, and able, to enforce the law. And that, in turn, could establish the credibility we need to tackle other aspects of the problem of illegal immigration.

  This week, Congress will send legislation to President Bush denying economic assistance to any foreign government that refuses to protect U.S. troops, government personnel, and civilians from arbitrary arrest and prosecution before the United Nations International Criminal Court (ICC). While nearly 100 nations have signed ""non surrender"" agreements with the U.S., many refuse to do so.  
   The United States is not a party to the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction. Even so, the court can currently arrest and prosecute our troops and personnel operating in U.N. peacekeeping missions if the host nation is a member of the ICC, accepts its jurisdiction voluntarily, or is directed by the U.N. Security Council. 
   Consider: A U.N. report issued last week called for the Security Council to refer suspected cases of war crimes to the ICC. Almost simultaneously, war crimes charges were filed in a German court against Defense Secretary Rumsfeld for prison abuses at Abu Graib in Iraq. A German human rights group argued, under the much abused and misunderstood concept of ""universal jurisdiction,"" that any citizen or group can file a claim against any world leader who may be guilty of committing crimes against humanity. Can anyone reasonably believe that more such cases are not soon to follow? 
   Although the Clinton Administration helped negotiate the terms and scope of the ICC, and even signed the treaty that created it in 1998, it was never submitted to the Senate for ratification. On May 6, 2002, the Bush Administration formally renounced any commitment to join the ICC or recognize its jurisdiction, citing fundamental structural flaws that would allow the court to undermine the role of the U.N. Security Council in maintaining international peace and security, as well as concerns over unchecked prosecutorial power and efforts to assert jurisdiction over citizens of states that have not ratified the treaty. 
   Congress then overwhelmingly passed the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, which spelled out strong objections to the ICC and prohibited any level of U.S. government cooperation with it. The legislation also required the Administration to pursue measures to protect Americans from the Court's reach. 
   It is no secret that the majority of U.N. peacekeeping operations are conducted in countries that are non-democratic and whose leaders are hostile to U.S. policies. Leaving our leaders, troops, and personnel vulnerable to arrest and use as political pawns would be a colossal mistake and one the President was right to avoid. But given the likelihood that the United States will be called upon to send troops to future U.N. peacekeeping missions, it is critical that additional steps be taken now to create more concrete and permanent protections. 
   First, Congress and the Administration should conduct a review of where U.S. troops and personnel are operating as peacekeepers, and determine whether their continued deployment is an appropriate use of our resources in the ongoing war against terrorism. The Administration must insist on ""non-surrender"" agreements with host countries to prevent any Americans from being turned over to the ICC. No troops or personnel should be committed to any mission without such protection. 
   Second, Congress must reaffirm its own commitment to protecting American citizens by passing a joint resolution calling on the U.N. Security Council to pass a permanent resolution providing immunity for U.S. troops and government personnel, and if necessary, exercise our veto over any resolution offered that would involve the utilization of U.S. resources. 
   Such provisions should not be interpreted as placing Americans overseas above the rule of law. The government will continue to hold all of our citizens, including our troops, to the highest standards of accountability. But at the same time we must recognize the unique nature of our position in the world, and the historical tendency of non-democratic leaders to use international institutions purely to score political points against the United States. Ceding criminal authority to an unaccountable and politicized ICC would hardly advance peace and security in today's world. 
   Every day our troops and personnel work around the globe to wage the war on terror and to secure freedom for not only our citizens, but countless others. Just as it is our duty to provide them with the tools they need, it is our solemn responsibility to protect them from being used as political pawns by despots and dictators.

We have a responsibility to do whatever is necessary to bring a permanent end to the excessive burden of this tax as soon as we can.
   ""If an opportunity to deal with the death tax comes before May, we retain the option of taking it up then.

  President Bush this week unveiled to Congress his proposed 2007 federal budget which outlines spending for federal government agencies and shapes tax initiatives intended to continue our economic growth.
   It continues the successful pro-growth policies that have encouraged economic growth and job creation over the past year, and specifically calls on Congress to make permanent the tax relief initiatives from 2001 and 2003 to ensure that the United States sustains a stimulative economic trend. President Bush during the State of the Union best encapsulates our mission, stating that ""if we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome."" 
   It's important to note that critics of the President's budget will claim the tax reductions over the past few years caused economic damage. The opposite is the case. They have helped generate over 4.7 million new jobs since full implementation, kept us on track to cut the national deficit in half by 2009, and produced 2005 revenues of $274 billion more than in 2004. The best way to ensure that we can fund our priorities is to continue to support pro-growth tax policies.
   I was also pleased to see the funding requests I made for crucial ports of entry along the Arizona/Mexico border were fulfilled in the President's proposed budget. Among my high-priority requests, $42 million will be directed toward the construction of the new port of entry at San Luis, near Yuma, and the second puts $9.8 million toward reconfiguration and improvements at the Nogales-Mariposa port of entry. The completion of these projects promises relief from miles-long delays that have hampered economic development in our border region.
   I also laud the President's proposals to fortify security along the Southern border. Among the many border security and immigration initiatives, the President has requested:
   * $458.9 million to provide 1,500 new Border Patrol Agents, bringing the total number of agents added to 3,000 since 2005, and representing a 42 percent increase in the Border Patrol Agent workforce since 9/11.
   * $41.7 million for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to strengthen worksite enforcement. A more robust worksite enforcement program will send a strong deterrence message to employers who knowingly hire illegal workers, reduce the economic incentive for illegal immigration, and help restore the integrity of employment laws.
   * $135 million to expand the current employment-verification pilot program to support a national verification requirement.
   * $29.7 million for the Southwest Border Prosecution Initiative - a program originally created with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison - to fund prosecutor's offices in the Southwest for processing, detaining, and prosecuting drug cases.
   While these requests represent a positive step toward securing our borders, we still have a long way to go, and the Senate must work toward completing and passing comprehensive legislation that will augment the President's security approach. As the budget process moves forward, I will continue to make the case for border security and immigration improvements and will work to secure the appropriations needed this year.
   While recognizing the positive steps made in the proposed 2007 federal budget, I'd be remiss if I did not note my concerns that enough funding isn't allocated to prevent and contain wildfires in Arizona and the Southwest. As Arizona is seeing its driest winters in history, the fires that engulfed the Payson area have ravaged over 3000 acres of National Forest. The budget proposal for the Forest Service cuts fire preparedness by $10 million and other fire operations by nearly 36 percent. Preventing and containing wildfires on National Forests is a federal responsibility, and I am not convinced that there is enough funding in this budget to reduce the wildfire risk to our communities and the surrounding landscapes.
   The ability of the federal government to fund provisions as outlined will depend on the spirit and willingness of taxpayers to assist with the cost. The American public is generous as long as it knows that representatives in Congress are taking the most streamlined and fiscally responsible approach. This President's proposal is a good start, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to build upon this foundation.

Entitled ""Habeas Corpus Proceedings and Issues of Actual Innocence,"" the hearing focused on S. 1088, Kyl's Streamlined Procedures Act, which would update the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), passed in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing.  
   ""The AEDPA was designed to limit endless death penalty appeals in state convictions, but ten years later it has become clear that the problem has not been fixed,"" Kyl said. ""The backlog of habeas claims has increased, not decreased, and so has the burden on prosecutors. In the Philadelphia District Attorney's office alone, the number of lawyers employed exclusively on habeas work has increased by 400 percent. Meanwhile, federal-court appeals still drag on endlessly."" 
   The AEDPA imposed a limit for all appeals relating to the right to writ of habeas corpus in capital cases, and reduced the length of the appeal process by limiting the role of federal courts. (Habeas corpus is the mechanism by which convicted criminals can attempt to demonstrate that their convictions or sentences violate the Constitution.) When it was enacted, then-President Clinton remarked that ""it should not take eight or nine years and three trips to the Supreme Court to finalize whether a person in fact was properly convicted or not."" 
   Unfortunately, Kyl noted, in many cases it still takes that long or longer. Last month, Carol Fornoff testified in the House about the impact on her family of delays in reviewing the case of the man who raped and murdered her 13-year-old daughter in Tempe, Arizona in 1984. Christy Ann Fornoff was abducted while collecting newspaper subscriptions at an apartment complex near her home. Voluminous physical evidence linked her murder to a man in the apartment complex, and he was convicted and sentenced in 1985. The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the case in a lengthy opinion in 1988. The killer then filed a federal habeas petition in 1992, and the federal district court spent 7 years reviewing the case. After more appeals and remands, the case still remains in federal habeas review today, two decades after the killer's conviction. 
   ""Mrs. Fornoff's testimony makes a powerful case for why these types of delays are intolerable,"" Kyl said. ""Among other things, she noted that by this fall the case will have been in the federal appellate courts for longer than Christy was alive. She has right to know within a reasonable timeframe if the murderer was properly convicted, if his conviction might be thrown out, if she might have to endure another trial, or worse, if there is a possibility that he might one day be released."" 
   According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, in fiscal year 1994, there were 13,359 federal habeas petition pending before the U.S. District Courts. By fiscal year 2003 - the last year for which data are available - that number had risen by nearly 10,000 petitions, to 23,218. Similarly, in fiscal year 1994, 3,799 habeas petitions were pending before the U.S. Courts of Appeals. By 2003, that number had nearly doubled, to 7,025. 
   Kyl has long championed the cause of victims' rights, co-sponsoring the Justice for All Act with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), which President Bush signed into law last fall. ""It has often been said that justice delayed is justice denied,"" Kyl said. ""That's every bit as true for crime victims as it is for criminal defendants."" 
   ""At the same time,"" he added, ""Everyone agrees that it is important to allow prisoners who are actually innocent the opportunity to prove it at every point in the process. For this reason, at every point, this bill allows actual innocence claims (as opposed to procedural objections) to move forward unimpeded. We all want to make sure that an innocent person is not executed. But we also want finality for victims, and that means reducing the backlog of habeas petitions."" 
   Kent Cattani, chief counsel for the capitol litigation section of the Arizona Attorney General's office, testified in strong support of Kyl's bill, as did Assistant Attorney General John Pressley Todd of the same office. A House version of the bill has been introduced by Rep. Dan Lundgren (R-CA).

KYL APPLAUDS HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS BILL'S FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Jon Kyl today in remarks on the Senate floor praised Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee for the emphasis on immigration and border security in the FY06 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  
   ""We've worked for a long time to improve our border security, but while we've had some success, the federal government has never devoted adequate resources. Finally, we have now gotten legislation to the Senate floor that genuinely recognizes the scope of the problem, and commits serious resources to deal with it. There's still much to be done, but this bill represents a quantum leap toward the goal of restoring the rule of law along the border."" 
   The DHS appropriations bill: 
   * includes $5.9 billion for Customs and Border Protection and $3.8 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement; 
   * provides 1,000 new border control agents, in addition to the 500 provided in the FY05 emergency supplemental spending bill; 
   * provides 300 new immigration/customs investigators, in addition to the 50 provided in the supplemental 
   * provides 460 new enforcement agents, in addition to the 168 provided in the supplemental; 
   * funds over 40,800 positions dedicated to protecting our borders and enforcing immigration laws: 12,500 border patrol agents, 18,200 customs and border protection officers, nearly 6,100 criminal investigators for customs and immigration; 1,300 deportation officers and nearly 2,700 immigration enforcement agents and detention officers; 
   * provides $340 million to support deployment of US VISIT; 
   * provides $525 million for air and marine operations; 
   * funds 2,240 new detention beds for apprehended illegal aliens; 
   * more than doubles the number of ports, since 2003, operating the Container Security Initiative; 
   * provides nearly $1 billion for biological countermeasures and the biosurveillance program.
   Kyl today joined Senator John McCain in co-sponsoring an amendment to the bill that would increase the amount of detention space available to hold apprehended illegal aliens. 
   In his floor statement, Kyl noted that because of the current shortage of such detention space, detainees must often be turned loose, without even adequate investigation as to whether they have criminal records or constitute a danger to the general public. The amendment would redirect nearly $200 million DHS funding to increase the number of detention beds by 5,760. It is likely to be followed by another to add 1,000 new border patrol agents to the bill.

  Sens. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Dianne Feinstein (R-CA) today successfully added a provision to H.R. 5441, the 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which would criminalize construction of a tunnel across an international border.  
   The provision specifically would prohibit and criminalize the construction or financing of an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an international border into the United States with a term of imprisonment up to 20 years. Additionally, any person who uses a tunnel or subterranean passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or illegal goods will be punished by doubling the sentence if convicted. 
   ""These tunnels not only provide an avenue for people to illegally enter our country and smuggle narcotics into the United States, but it poses a very serious risk to our national security,"" said Kyl. ""It gives terrorists, and those wishing to do harm to Americans, a way to subvert or border security efforts on the ground. The only thing more astonishing than the discovery of these border tunnels is the fact that they're not currently illegal."" 
   ""Cross-border tunnels pose an unmistakable threat to our nation's homeland security. The Senate today sent a clear message that we are fully prepared to punish those who would build, operate, and finance these tunnels,"" said Feinstein. ""Closing this loophole in our laws will help stem the tide of criminals who would smuggle illegal aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or other illegal goods into the United States through these tunnels. And those who would turn a blind eye should be forewarned that they too will be prosecuted under the full extent of the law."" 
   Since 2001, over 40 border tunnels have been found along the southern border of the United States. At least 29 of the tunnels were found in Arizona. 
   The underlying bill, H.R. 5441 is scheduled for a vote late Thursday.

  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today successfully added a provision to H.R. 5441, the 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which will help to significantly curtail the ""catch and release"" policy along the border by funding an additional 1,700 detention spaces.  
   ""Tens of thousands of foreign nationals caught illegally crossing our border each year are released into the United States because DHS lacks the detention space to hold them. When released, those aliens are instructed to appear for administrative hearings - most of them fail to appear for their hearings and are never seen again,"" said Kyl. ""Consider the opportunity this has presented to terrorists and criminals - apprehended at the border, but ultimately released into the United States. By funding this additional detention space, we're giving DHS the increased ability to hold, identify, and process, those trying to illegally enter our country."" 
   The Department of Homeland Security has requested a total of 27,500 detention bed spaces to help significantly curtail the ""catch and release"" policy along the border. With Kyl's efforts, legislation from 2006 has so far brought the total number of detention spaces to 25,800. The Kyl amendment will fund the remaining 1,700 detention spaces. 
   A separate Kyl amendment to fund an additional 500 border patrol agents was blocked by Senate Democrats.

KYL INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO ADD LAND TO LAS CIENEGAS CONSERVATION AREA
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today introduced the Las Cienegas Enhancement Act of 2006, a bill that would add 2,400 acres of land to the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area in southern Arizona. 
   The bill directs an exchange of a federal-owned 1,280 acre parcel of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) south of Tucson near Corona de Tucson for a privately-held, 2,392-acre parcel that lies to the north of the current conservation area's boundaries.
   ""The inclusion of this additional acreage in the conservation area means it will be protected from certain residential or commercial development in the future,"" said Kyl. ""I'm glad the natural beauty and resources found in this area of the Sonoran Desert will be there for future generations because of this exchange.""
   The federally-owned land consists of low-lying Sonoran desert and has already been identified for disposal by the BLM through its land-use planning process.
   Two other important objectives are accomplished with this exchange: addressing water withdrawals at Cienegas Creek and providing road access to a popular recreation destination, the Whetstone Mountains, controlled by the Forest Service.
   Under the bill, existing water claims on the land that will be acquired are dramatically reduced, from 1,600 acre feet of water a year to 550. Pima County will administer and enforce this limitation. Kyl's bill recognizes that not only is it important to promote responsible use of our limited water supply, but the claims, if utilized as currently written, could have a detrimental impact on the conservation area.
   ""The agreed reduction of the water claims is a significant benefit to the area,"" said Kyl. ""There are real concerns about the future of Cienegas Creek and the entire riparian area if there were to be water withdrawals at the higher level.""
   Although congressional authorization is not always necessary to complete exchanges involving federal land, it can be a more efficient, cost effective alternative to the administrative process. And Kyl notes that this exchange represents a consensus reached through the hard work of several concerned parties.
   ""This bill is the end product of negotiation,"" said Kyl. ""State and local officials, conservationists, and other stakeholders have worked together to structure an exchange that is fair and in the public interest.""
   Senator John McCain (R-AZ) is a cosponsor. A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in March by Congressman Jim Kolbe (R-AZ).

KYL CALLS FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS CRITICAL TO FOREST HEALTH
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today released a coauthored letter that he and Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) sent to Senate Appropriators requesting a greater investment in biomass-utilization grant programs within the Forest Service and the Department of Energy. They are critical to cost-effective long-term forest restoration and sustainable economic development in our rural communities. 
   ""Funding for these programs is critical to meeting the missions of the forest-management agencies, is effective in helping the economies of our rural forest communities, and plays an important role in developing alternative sources of energy,"" said Kyl and Bingaman in the letter.
   Biomass-utilization grant programs help reduce forest management costs on public, private, state, and tribal lands by increasing the value of biomass and other forest products generated by hazardous fuels reduction and other forest treatments. They also create business incentives for increased use of biomass and facilitate projects that help remove economic and market barriers for use of small-diameter trees and woody biomass.
   These grants help to address two significant natural resource challenges in Arizona and the west: restoring the health of our forests and developing a clean and renewable source of energy. In the case of wildfire, reduced costs means that more fuel treatment work is possible, which will lessen the threat of wildfires and the damage they do to communities and the environment.
   The bipartisan letter was signed by 14 Senators, many from western states, where the threat of wildfires and the need for forest-health funding remains greatest.
   ""The need for healthier forests is not a partisan issue,"" said Kyl. ""The more we can do to encourage programs and policies that clean up excessive biomass in forests, the sooner we will see a reduction in the damage wildfires inflict.""

  I recently held a hearing in my Terrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee intended to reacquaint the public with the dire consequences of the federal government's failure to control the southern border of the United States. 
   Our porous border with Mexico has permitted a historically unprecedented number of foreign nationals from over 120 countries to enter the United States illegally. While recognizing that many come here to seek better wages and a better standard of living, we cannot ignore the fact that at least ten percent of the aliens apprehended along the border are criminals and violence is rapidly escalating-last year alone, criminal assaults were up 108% according to U.S. Attorney, Paul Charlton. Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever testified his officers have been the focus of increasing violence and targeted attacks.  
   In the last five months alone, the Border Patrol has arrested 42,722 aliens with criminal records attempting to cross the border. Among them were 6,770 felons; 148 persons wanted in connection with a homicide; 42 associated with a kidnapping; 164 associated with a sexual assault; 298 associated with a robbery, 1,957 wanted for assault, and 4,161 connected with drug crimes. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 139,000 of the 1.1 million people apprehended on the border in 2005 were criminal aliens seeking to illegally reenter the United States. 
   A temporary worker program would reduce some of the pressure along the southern border because it could provide a legal avenue to work in the U.S, eliminating the need for immigrants to pay violent smugglers to get them across. But you can be sure that the hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens who will be barred from participating in any temporary worker plan will continue trying to reenter the United States, as will members of the hyper-violent drug cartels located just across the border. We must have the resources in place to defeat them. 
   I have frequently heard the argument that the United States cannot stop the flow of illegal immigrants and contraband across the border. According to the experts, that just isn't true. First, while we have increased the number of Border Patrol Agents, there are still not enough of them. In 2005, the Border Patrol had 11,268 Agents patrolling 9,071 miles of U.S. border. That does not compare favorably with the city of New York, which employs 39,110 police officers to patrol its five boroughs. Until we have an adequate force of Border Patrol agents to protect our borders, and have equipped them with the technology and infrastructure they need to accomplish the mission, one cannot argue that it is impossible to protect the border. 
   Second, the United States has been slow to make a concerted effort to place strategic fencing and vehicle barriers along the border to prevent narco-traffickers, human smugglers, and illegal aliens from simply crossing the border at will. Much of our border with Mexico is delineated by a rusted strand of barbed wire that has been beaten into the dirt by thousands of illegal crossers. 
   I am pleased that my Senate colleagues approved my amendment to modernize the fencing on the Arizona border with Mexico. Built properly, fences work: The fence in the San Diego Sector has dramatically reduced illegal immigration and drug trafficking across that sector. My amendment authorizes replacement of existing ""landing mat"" fences with ""see through fencing"" and expands the strategic use of that fencing as well as vehicle barriers. 
   The experts agree that a combination of stronger border security infrastructure, improving interior enforcement (including in the workplace), implementing an effective temporary worker program and comprehensive reform to immigration policies can solve our illegal immigration and border violence problems. I share in this belief and will continue working to reach these solutions.

  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) today voted against legislation that ostensibly was dedicated to improving national security, yet failed to include key provisions that would help prevent terrorists and criminals from entering the United States, expedite the deportation of criminal aliens, and increase penalties for supporting terrorism.  
   ""While I can applaud the part of this bill that helps states improve their interoperability capabilities, this bill misses the mark in many key areas,"" said Kyl. ""One would assume that a bill entitled 'Improving America's Security' would actually help improve America's security, yet the primary accomplishment of this bill seemingly is the creation of labor unions within a government agency that is entrusted with our homeland security. 
   Republicans wanted to ensure that a vital national security function is not controlled by union politics. Homeland Security officials would be required to get approval from unions for every change in policy or personnel assignments, inhibiting their ability to flexibly respond to terrorist threats and other emergencies. 
   ""Senate Democratic leadership had a real opportunity here to work together to craft legislation that could help strengthen our national security and prevent terrorism,"" said Kyl. ""But once again, they failed to permit votes on key amendments to help improve legislation dealing with the most critical issue facing our nation."" 
   The pending amendments that were offered but were not allowed consideration: would have made it a crime to recruit people to commit terrorist acts; authorizes the immediate deportation of suspected terrorists whose visas are revoked on terrorism grounds; prevents the release of criminal aliens whose home countries delay their return to their home country; makes it a crime to encourage terrorism by rewarding the families of suicide bombers after the bombings take place; and increases penalties for those who perpetuate terrorist hoaxes. 
   The Improving America's Security Act of 2007 also does not implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. All but two of the 9/11 Commission recommendations were already addressed by legislation passed by the Republican Congress or by independent action by the Bush Administration.

  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today considered legislation to reauthorize the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The program was first created in 2003, and provided $15 billion over five years to the cause of AIDS relief in parts of the world ravaged by that disease. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) released the following statement: 
   ""PEPFAR was a demonstration of the American people's desire to help those in need. The 2003 legislation was also a demonstration of the American people's desire that their generosity not be wasted, as they have seen before with so many other aid programs. To that end, the legislation required that the lion's share of the funds be devoted to treatment of patients in need.
   ""It is therefore mind-boggling to me that recent reauthorization proposals - the bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week and the bill considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today - would take such giant steps backward.
   ""Among its many flaws, the House proposal removes the requirement that organizations that receive PEPFAR grants be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. The Senate proposal waters down the 'conscience clause,' which protects humanitarian and medical professionals involved in these programs from having to participate in prevention and treatment methods that they find morally or religiously objectionable.
   ""What's most troubling with both the House and Senate proposals is that they remove a requirement - on a program dedicated to AIDS relief - that at least fifty-five percent of the funds in the program be spent on treatment of AIDS patients. This provision was an important check on bureaucratic wastefulness. And after removing this requirement, both proposals then triple the amount appropriated to $50 billion!
   ""The goal of PEPFAR is important, but our annual foreign aid budget is not limitless. Congress is beginning the annual budget cycle and we are confronted daily with requests for more and more federal spending. Agreeing to this massive increase is p not the way to discipline what is already shaping up to be a budget train wreck.
   ""I supported the creation of PEPFAR in 2003. And I could reluctantly support doubling that amount over the next five years. But adding another $20 billion on top of that is too much. We cannot lose sight of the sacrifices of millions of Americans who work hard and pay the taxes that support these programs. I cannot support a bill that so dramatically spends beyond what we can afford and so wantonly ignores accountability and transparency tools that safeguard the generosity of the American people.""

  Everyone can agree that securing our nation's borders isn't simply a matter of controlling the flow of illegal immigration; it's also a matter of national security. That's why just last month, the Senate overwhelmingly approved by a vote of 95 to 1 a measure to the defense spending bill that provides over $3 billion in resources to help secure our borders. 
   Yet, last week, Congressional Democrats stripped that funding from the bill. And under Senate procedures, there was no realistic way of reinstating the money or defeating the bill, because it provided all the critical funding for the U.S. military for the fiscal year that had already begun.  
   It amazes me that folks go around talking about the need to secure our border, vote to do so (when the country is watching), but then quietly go back on their commitment, hoping no one notices. It's no wonder that Americans have no faith that the government has the will to secure the border. 
   Had this money been approved, the $3 billion would have provided funding to bring the total number of full-time Border Patrol agents to 23,000; construction of 700 miles of border fencing by the end of FY 2009; 300 miles of vehicle barriers; 105 ground-based radar and camera towers; building or leasing enough jail space to house 45,000 illegal immigrants; funding to reimburse states and localities for certain expenses defined under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and requiring that $60 million be dedicated to states to help employers comply with employee verification requirements. 
   In short, the $3 billion provided crucial funding for border security and would have continued critical progress we've made over the last couple of years. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff just reported on the situation. 
   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has now completed more than 150 miles of fencing and 115 miles of vehicle barriers on the southwest border, with plans to build an additional 225 miles of fencing and 200 miles of vehicle barriers by the end of 2008. 
   Border Patrol agents are increased to roughly 15,000 agents and should get to more than 18,300 agents by the end of 2008. 
   Under Operation Jump Start, the National Guard continues to support the Border Patrol in a very effective partnership. According to DHS, the National Guard has specifically assisted in apprehending nearly 124,000 illegal aliens and seizing more than 900 vehicles, 250,000 pounds of marijuana, nearly 5,000 pounds of cocaine, and more than $68,000 in currency since the beginning of the operation. 
   As a result of this increased effort, fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally - apprehensions of illegal aliens at the southern border are down 22 percent. 
   While I am encouraged by the progress we have made, we still need the $3 billion, so Republicans are going to try to include it in another bill. The problem is that the President has threatened to veto that bill because it is $4 billion over budget. So we would be in another ""Catch 22"" situation: either accept the wasteful over budget spending or do without the border security funding. 
   Such are the political games played in Washington. It is no wonder that Congress's approval rating has fallen to an all time low. 
   At least voters now have less than a year to wait to register their views at the polls and ponder whether the great change promised in last year's election was in the right direction.

   Such ""class warfare"" is a common political strategy, although its effectiveness has been inconsistent because Americans are typically less interested in stoking resentment than in joining the ranks of the wealthy themselves. What sets apart this latest campaign is the evolution of its targets.
   Aimed initially at ""millionaires,"" then broadened to include those in the top tax bracket, Congressional Democrats' tax hike proposals now target individuals with taxable income above $200,000 a year. Who are these people? In many cases, small business owners - the engine of growth and job creation in our economy and a group that virtually all politicians claim to want to help.
   Of the taxpayers reporting more than $200,000 in taxable income in 2001, the most recent year for which IRS data is available, more than half - about 1.3 million - included income from small business entities, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations.
   In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Senator John Kerry promised to both ""reduce the tax burden on small business,"" and ""roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year."" Perhaps he was somehow unaware of the inherent contradiction between the two. Of course, Senator Kerry has also made campaign-trail promises of $2 trillion in new spending over the next ten years, and even his tax hike would raise only an estimated $300 billion. Thus it wouldn't take long for the burden to drop down to lower and lower income brackets.
   Raising small business taxes would reverse the success of the 2003 reductions in creating new jobs and prompting higher capital expenditures. Dr. Robert Berney, then-chief economist for the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, has testified before Congress that ""Every dollar of profit or tax relief tends to be re-invested in the [owner's] firm."" The Joint Economic Committee noted last year that ""research suggests that cutting marginal tax rates - particularly the top. . . rate faced by many small businesses today - is an effective way of encouraging entrepreneurs to invest in and expand their businesses.""
   The Democrats' tax hike proposal is based on the rather simplistic belief that upper-income taxpayers have more disposable income and, therefore, can easily afford to pay higher taxes. Besides the fact that more than half of these individuals are small business owners generally operating on razor-thin margins, it's also worth noting that they already account for more than 37 percent of all income taxes collected in the United States, despite filing fewer than 2 percent of all individual tax returns. In plain English, they're already paying their fair share, and then some.
   Since the turn of the century, the American economy has weathered a series of economic shocks - the terrorist attacks of September 11, the 2001 recession, corporate-management scandals, and the continuing war on terror, with major commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite the potential for such blows to send the economy reeling, the business community has responded with remarkable resilience, generating 11 consecutive quarters of growth through the second quarter of 2004. With the help of the 2003 tax cuts, small businesses have been the vanguard of the current economic expansion. Why on earth would we want to tamper with continued recovery by raising taxes on those most responsible for its success?

KYL PUSHES NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AT TERRORISM SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING
  Senate Terrorism, Technology & Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today held a hearing to review ongoing legislative efforts to provide law enforcement authorities with more effective tools to fight terrorism. Of particular focus in the hearing was S. 2679, the Tools to Fight Terrorism Act, (TFTA) recently introduced by Kyl along with several other members of the subcommittee and the Senate leadership. 
   ""Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, congressional committees and executive agencies have conducted extensive reviews of our nation's antiterrorism safety net, and we've uncovered numerous flaws and gaps in our antiterrorism system,"" Kyl said. ""We have found, for example, that in many cases anti-terror investigators still have less authority to access information than do investigators of other crimes, such as those involving mail fraud. We have also seen that some of the federal code's criminal offenses and penalties are far too light, or too narrow in their scope, in light of the contemporary terrorist threat. Yet, despite all of these hearings and inquiries, Congress has passed no major anti-terror legislation since the passage of the USA Patriot Act almost three years ago.""
   TFTA is divided into five titles, which consist of all or part of 11 bills that currently are pending in the House or the Senate. Every provision of TFTA previously either has been introduced and is pending as a bill in Congress, or addresses a matter that has been explored in a congressional committee hearing. Among other things, the bill would:
   * Allow FBI agents to seek warrants for surveillance of suspected ""lone-wolf"" terrorists, such as alleged 20th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui.
   * Improve information sharing among federal agencies and with state and local authorities, avoiding the types of barriers between criminal and intelligence investigators that impeded pre-September 11 searches in the United States for 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.
   * Punish hoaxes about terrorist crimes or the death of a U.S. soldier, imposing penalties commensurate with the disruptions and trauma inflicted by such hoaxes.
   * Impose stiff 30-year mandatory-minimum penalties for possession of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, atomic and radiologial bombs, and variola virus (smallpox) - penalties sufficient to deter middlemen who might help terrorists acquire these weapons.
   * Create a set of criminal offenses tailored to the unique challenges of guaranteeing the security of our nation's seaports.
   Witnesses at the hearing included: U.S. Assistant Attorney General Daniel J. Bryant; Barry Sabin, Chief of the Counterterrorism Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice; and Prof. Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School. Turley, a respected constitutional scholar, testified that in his view all of the major provisions of the bill would likely withstand a Supreme Court challenge.
   ""The third anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks serve as a timely reminder of the importance of providing law enforcement with the tools they need to do their jobs effectively,"" Kyl said. ""Every provision in this bill has been vetted extensively and many have been languishing for months if not years. There's not excuse for Congress not to move quickly to make these improvements to our homeland security.""

  Last week, the U.S. commander of Multi-National Forces Iraq, General David Petraeus, and the US Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, reported to Congress. While many significant challenges remain in Iraq, they stressed that measurable progress has been made since they last testified before Congress in September 2007. Most importantly, both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker stated that the war in Iraq has made America safer.
   When the President sent roughly 30,000 more troops to Iraq in early 2007 as part of the troop surge strategy, many declared the plan a failure before it even began. But by the end of last year, it became clear that significant progress had been made, and the violence in Iraq had significantly decreased. 
   Some of those same naysayers now hesitantly acknowledge that we have succeeded in decreasing the insurgent violence, but charge that the new Iraqi government has failed to meet political and legislative benchmarks that were set by Congress in early 2007. Frederick Kagan, a key architect of the counter-insurgency strategy, disagrees. In an April 3rd article, he cites a recent study by the U.S. Institute of Peace that notes two-thirds of these benchmarks have been met, and the remaining marks are close to being achieved.
   According to Ambassador Crocker, ""Iraq's parliament has been formulated, debated vigorously, and in many cases passed legislation dealing with vital issues of reconciliation and nation building."" The Iraqi government has also established the basis for democratic elections, it continues to make progress toward completing a constitutional review, and it has implemented legislation on de-Baathification.
   Al Qaeda in Iraq, which had virtually taken over significant portions of Iraq before the surge, has retreated to only a few parts of the country today. Moreover, the Iraqi people themselves have rejected the violence and horror that is the mark of al Qaeda and its affiliates. It is critical to the defeat of the terrorists that the Muslim world itself fights them. As Senator Lindsey Graham noted, ""When Arab Muslim people say no to al Qaeda and we will fight bin Laden, his agents, and sympathizers, that is a good day for America.""
   Iraqi forces have also grown. According to General Petraeus, well over 100,000 Iraqi soldiers and police were added in 2007, and the number continues to grow. This joint effort, with the Iraqi forces continuing to bear more responsibility for the security and development of their nation, is a sign that things are moving in the right direction.
   General Petraeus cautioned, however, that ""the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible."" He also told Congress that there is clear evidence that Iran is heavily invested in an American defeat in Iraq and poses the biggest threat to our success there.
   General Petraeus's testimony reminds us that Congress must quickly pass a bill to provide the resources necessary for our troops to continue succeeding in Iraq. Under no circumstances should a bill dedicated to providing resources to our troops be used as a legislative vehicle to finance unrelated domestic spending projects.
   Approximately 20,000 U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Iraq by July, according to the Pentagon. As the conditions in Iraq continue to improve, we can continue drawing down our U.S. troops from Iraq. As General Petraeus said, ""We're after conditions that would allow our soldiers to disengage. And that is in fact what we are doing as we achieve progress, as we have with the surge and that is what is indeed allowing us to withdraw the surge forces.""

  The story of Arizona is in many respects the story of our effort to secure adequate water for our future. Figuring large in this effort is the mighty Colorado River, long considered to be the ""lifeblood of the West."" 
   The river rises in the mountains of Colorado and flows for about 1,300 miles through Colorado, Utah and Arizona and along the Arizona-Nevada and Arizona-California boundaries, after which it passes into Mexico and empties in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of California, as detailed in the case of Arizona v California. On its journey to the sea, it gathers water from tributaries in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona, sustaining the lives of over 25 million people. The Colorado River basin covers 242,000 square miles in seven states (Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming). Although it is not the largest river in the United States, the Colorado is the most legislated, most debated, and most litigated river in the entire world.  
   The Colorado River Compact of 1922 divided the seven Colorado River basin states into lower and upper basins and apportioned each basin 7.5 million acre-feet of water per year. (One acre-foot of water is 325,851 gallons, the amount used by a family of four in one year.) Six of the seven states took only a few years to ratify the compact, but Arizona did not ratify it until 1944, largely due to a dispute over its share of the river. 
   After over a decade of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court in Arizona v. California ruled that Arizona has rights to 2.8 million acre-feet of mainstream Colorado River water a year; California, 4.4 million acre-feet; and Nevada, 300,000 acre-feet. 
   Although Arizona scored a major victory in Arizona v. California, it did not have the ability to divert and use its full allocation of Colorado River water. Instead, it had to rely on groundwater and some surface water reservoir storage. But, as the state continued to grow, Arizonans realized that the Salt River Project's storage system and groundwater supplies alone would not be able to sustain the ever-expanding population, business, and industry. In fact, Arizona's heavy reliance on groundwater created an annual overdraft (the difference between pumping and natural replenishment) of some 2.2 million acre-feet per year. The problem was so severe that parts of Pinal and Maricopa County literally began to subside as the water below was pumped out and aquifers collapsed. Senator Carl Hayden warned at the time that ""the survival of our dear state is at stake."" 
   The solution was the Central Arizona Project (CAP), a 336-mile canal designed to bring approximately 2.2 million acre-feet of Colorado River water to central and southern Arizona. The project began construction in 1973 and was mostly completed by 1994. The CAP now manages Arizona's single largest renewable water supply, serving approximately 1.8 million people in Arizona. 
   Although the benefits of the CAP to Arizona are immeasurable, it has not been without controversy. Indeed, by the time the project neared completion, a $500 million dispute had arisen between the entity that operates the CAP, and the U.S. government, over the way the CAP costs were allocated and the amount that this Arizona entity was obligated to repay the federal government for the project's construction costs. 
   The Arizona Water Settlements Act, which I authored and won passage of in 2004, resolved this and several other related disputes concerning water. The law also gives a number of Arizona cities additional CAP water that is vital to ensuring their sustainable growth and development. Like the CAP, the legislation is a major component of Arizona's water plan for the future and brings long-sought certainty to Arizona and its cities regarding their water supplies. 
   Ultimately, it is hard to overstate the importance of the Colorado River to Arizonans. In a future column, I will write about a new joint federal-state effort to protect the water and surrounding environment of the river.

  This week, along with Senator Bill Nelson (D-NE), I plan to introduce legislation that would eliminate one of the most heartless provisions of the U.S. tax code, which is hardly known for compassion to begin with.  
   The tax on inheritances, or the ""death tax,"" is unfair, inefficient, economically unsound and, frankly, immoral. Even though most Americans are unlikely to be subjected to it, most agree that it is fundamentally unfair to allow the federal government to seize more than half of a person's assets when he or she dies. 
   Consider the example of the small businessman or woman who works hard throughout life to make it a success. Or the farmer, who literally plows everything back into his operation, and owns substantial and expensive equipment, but little cash. These are the kinds of assets that can be subject to more than a 50 percent tax when the owner dies. 
   That's wrong. Part of the classic American dream is the ability to pass such assets on to one's children, in order that they might get a bit of a head start on life, keep the family business going, or simply enjoy a higher standard of living than their parents. The assets involved were already taxed when the income that acquired them was earned. According to a Gallup poll, 60 percent of Americans agree it is unfair for Washington to tax them again, particularly at such punitive levels. 
   As Edward J. McCaffrey, a law professor from the University of Southern California and self-described liberal, has testified before the Senate Finance Committee: ""Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes... The estate tax is an anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long term savings."" 
   Even setting aside such moral considerations, consider the impact of the death tax on the economy. Small, family-owned businesses, particularly manufacturers, often earn relatively low profit margins but are considered ""wealthy"" by the IRS because they own expensive production machinery or other equipment. When the owner of such a company dies unexpectedly, the heirs are often forced to sell off the business to pay the death tax. 
   Is the revenue to Washington worth the hurt and harm? No, the death tax accounts for a little more than one percent of the government's tax take. Not surprisingly, family-owned businesses and wealthier Americans go to great effort and expense to minimize their tax liability, essentially ""planning to die."" This distorts their business operating and investment plans, skews other financial decisions, and essentially diverts money from the federal treasury to lawyers and accountants. Alicia Munnell, a former member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, estimates that the costs of complying with death tax provisions are roughly equal to the revenue raised, or about $23 billion in 1998. 
   That's a patently ridiculous waste of money, and such bad policy that economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimate that repealing the death tax would actually increase gross domestic product, to such an extent that within ten years overall federal tax revenue would actually be higher than before. 
   We should end this tax on virtue, work, savings, job creation and the American dream, and end it for good.

KYL CALLS FOR GREATER FEDERAL RESOURCES TO COMBAT ARIZONA FIRES
  Sen. Jon Kyl today sent a letter to Mark Rey, U.S. Department of Agriculture Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, urging that resources for wildfire preparedness and suppression in the Southwest be reviewed and reallocated given the recent ""February"" fire that is ravaging over 4,000 acres of forest near Payson, Arizona. New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, joined Kyl in sending the letter.
   ""The Southwest is seeing its driest winter on record,"" said Kyl. ""Wildfire season, which typically begins in May, has already started. I am afraid that Arizona could face the longest and most costly fire season in state history."" 
   In the letter sent to Mr. Rey, Sens. Kyl and Domenici specifically ask that the administration accelerate NEPA-ready forest thinning projects in Arizona and New Mexico and make available now the necessary firefighting assets needed to combat wildfires this season.
   ""Budgets and resource allocations are determined at least a year in advance,"" said Kyl. ""And as the Northwest region of the country is seeing record-breaking rain levels, while the Southwest region is seeing record dryness and an early wildfire season, I strongly ask the administration reconsider how our national wildfire preparedness and suppression resources be allocated.""
   The President's 2007 budget proposal cuts fire preparedness by $10 million and other fire operations by nearly 36 percent, while placing significant emphasis on implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan. The Forest Service plans to spend $182 million on implementation spread across several accounts including hazardous fuels, vegetation and watershed management and forest products. These projects mark an increase of $66 million for the Northwest Forest Plan over fiscal year 2006.
   Text of the letter can be found below.
   February 14, 2006
   The Honorable Mark E. Rey Undersecretary Natural Resources and Environment U.S. Department of Agriculture Washington, DC 20250
   Dear Mr. Rey:
   The Southwest's intensifying drought and higher than normal temperatures, together with unnatural accumulations of hazardous fuels, conspire to create the conditions for a devastating wildfire season that could be the longest and most costly in our states' histories.
   Although it is early in the year, Arizona unfortunately has its first fire of the season. The ""February"" fire, burning north of Payson on the Tonto National Forest, is over 4,000 acres and will cost the Forest Service an estimated $3 million to successfully suppress.
   We are afraid that this fire is a sign of things to come in our region. Yet past budgets and the budget the administration has put forth for fiscal year 2007 have targeted the Pacific Northwest, and specifically implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan. While offering a sustainable level of timber and protecting the long-term health of these forests is important, the Northwest is not experiencing the severe conditions being seen in the Southwest. It is crucial that Arizona and New Mexico have: 1) the resources needed to perform thinning that will prevent fires and 2) the firefighting assets to catch them on initial attack. This will reduce the wildfire risk to our communities and the surrounding landscapes.
   We understand that budgets and resource allocations are crafted at least a year in advance. However, only the current conditions on the ground can dictate priorities. We urge you to take every feasible measure to accelerate NEPA-ready forest thinning projects in our states and to make available now the necessary firefighting assets that we need to combat the wildfires we know are coming.
   Sincerely,
   JON KYL United States Senator

  Sen. Jon Kyl today was named by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), as a conferee to the conference committee on H.R. 4297, the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005. 
   Key provisions of the H.R. 4297 include:
   * Capital Gains and Dividends: Senate approved 53-47 a motion instructing the conferees to include both alternative minimum tax protections and the capital gains and dividend extension in the final conference report.
   * Saver's Credit: The Saver's Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit that encourages low income taxpayers to make contributions to an employer-provided retirement savings plan or an IRA. The tax reconciliation bill extends the credit through 2009; it is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2006. Nationwide, almost 5.5 million filers take advantage of this tax credit; 97,700 of those are in Arizona.
   * Above-the-Line Deduction for College Tuition Expenses: Under current law, the provision that allow a taxpayer to take an above-the-line deduction for college tuition costs expired at the end of 2005. The full deduction is available for joint filers with income under $130,000, and is phased-down for higher income filers. The tax reconciliation bill would extend it through 2009. Nationwide, over 3.6 million filers claimed this deduction in 2004; over 74,000 of those taxpayers are in Arizona.
   * Small Business Expensing: Under current law, small businesses can deduct the cost of qualified investments in the first year they are made, up to $100,000 indexed for inflation. After 2007, this amount will drop back to $25,000. The bill extends the increased amount through 2009. Keeping the increased amounts enables small businesses to invest and grow.
   ""Maintaining the current tax rates for capital gains and dividends is essential to ensuring that our economy continues to grow at a healthy pace,"" Kyl said. ""When businesses and investors can depend on low tax rates, they have a greater incentive to expand business operations and create new jobs.""

Today, it is the nation's fastest growing state, with a population of more than six million. 
   ""Tourists flock to the state for its cultural heritage and scenic beauty. Arizona is home to four national parks and many other national monuments and historic sites. Many who visit these sites are heeding the advice of Theodore Roosevelt, who said of the Grand Canyon, 'You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.' 
   ""From its days as a rough Wild West Territory to the dynamic state it is today, Arizona's beauty and culture has captivated those who have experienced it. I wish the state a happy birthday.""

   * Clarify that existing law on fraudulent access to transport facilities includes seaports and waterfronts within its scope, and increase the maximum prison term for a violation from five to 10 years;
   * Toughen sanctions, including criminal charges, for failure to cooperate with the U.S. Coast Guard;
   * Amend current law to close loopholes and make it a crime - with stiff penalties - to willfully use a dangerous weapon (including chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials) or explosive with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person on board a passenger vessel;
   * Provide criminal sanctions for intentionally damaging any of the Coast Guard's 50,000-plus navigational aids, and make it a crime to knowingly place in waters any device or substance likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, or to willfully and maliciously discharge a hazardous substance into U.S. waters with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm, or catastrophic economic injury;

  Following testimony by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and representatives of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration on the danger of re-importation of prescription drugs, Sen. Jon Kyl today urged the Senate to ""think twice, despite the political passions of the moment, about the implications of tampering with the safety of our national prescription drug supply."" 
   Giuliani, whose firm has completed a major study of drug importation from foreign sources into the United States, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the existing American pharmaceutical system is already vulnerable to significant exploitation of counterfeit, diluted or adulterated drugs entering the United States and that re-importation of drugs from Canada may only exacerbate the problem.
   Among other findings, the Giuliani study found that: the FDA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are short staffed and ill-equipped to randomly inspect the massive volume of incoming packages of drug products; corrupt secondary wholesalers compromise product quality in the drug supply; and that some patients purchasing re-imported Canadian medicines, particularly via the Internet, are receiving non-FDA approved drug manufactured in foreign countries, such as Pakistan, China, Iran and Singapore, that are frequently past their expiration date, sub-potent or more potent than indicated, wrongly dosed, contaminated or counterfeited, or not properly stored or shipped.
   Canada has a system of regulatory controls over its medicine supply, Giuliani noted, but does not inspect those medicines being imported into Canada and then exported into the United States.
   ""One of the purposes of last year's Medicare reform,"" Kyl said, ""was to provide for and reduce the price of prescription drugs, beginning with the drug discount cards that reduce drug prices by an average of 10-25 percent. Since most of the provisions of the law have not even take effect yet, Congress should be very cautious about allowing a flood of unregulated pharmaceuticals to come pouring in to the United States, many of which will be bogus and some even deadly.""

KYL CRITICIZES SENATE VOTE ON MARRIAGE AMENDMENT
  Sen. Jon Kyl said today that the Senate's vote against a motion to proceed to debate on a constitutional marriage amendment amounts to ""a setback for our society's most stabilizing and important institution - traditional marriage - as well as a failure to accept our responsibility as legislators to begin to deal with the issue rather than leaving it to lawyers and judges. 
   ""A marriage between a man and a woman is universally acknowledged to provide the best and healthiest environment for raising children. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental societal issue, or one more deserving of protection,"" Kyl added. ""As a nation, we've already grappled with this question and resolved it - with broad consensus - in the debate over whether to admit Utah as a state, when Congress required Utah to recognize only marriages between one man and one woman.
   ""To the extent that the traditional definition of marriage should be reconsidered at all - despite the wisdom and tradition of virtually all of human history - that process should take place within the realm of legislatures or citizens working directly through the ballot initiative process. Judges should not be inventing imaginary provisions in state constitutions, denouncing traditional marriage as a 'stain' that must be washed away, or scoffing at the 'mantra of tradition,' as the Massachusetts Supreme Court put it. But for this lack of judicial restraint, we wouldn't have arrived at this unfortunate point to begin with,"" Kyl said.
   ""It is unrealistic to assume that same-sex marriage can be isolated in some states but not others because of the federal Defense of Marriage Act,"" Kyl added. ""That legislation didn't stop Massachusetts' Supreme Court, and it won't stop other judges sympathetic to activist groups that are already seeking to bypass the legislative process and impose their agenda in more than 11 states. Even if the Defense of Marriage Act survives review by the U.S. Supreme Court, which is by no means a given, simple logistics make it unavoidable that states will be forced to contend with the policies of other states in everything from marriage dissolution to financial adjudication."" ""The constitutional amendment process is the most democratic, the most grass roots, the most respectful process available for the establishment of national policy, with extremely high hurdles, and appropriately so. It guarantees that the American people have a full and complete opportunity to speak to the issue, that they can express their views to their Senators, their Congressmen, and their state legislators. It takes time. But in the end, if a constitutional amendment passes - as opposed to a court decision - we know that the American people truly want it. And that is the very foundation of self-government.""

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   For over a week now the news media has been full of analysis and commentary on the impact of Ronald Reagan's presidency on America's economy, our sense of self-confidence, and our victory in the Cold War. Even his critics - well, some of them anyway - have come to recognize his contributions to freedom and prosperity, not just here at home but around the world.  
   I'm familiar with the statistics, and they are indeed compelling, just about any way you look at them: economic growth, new jobs, lower taxes, nations liberated from communism. But the 40th president of the United States was not a man driven by statistics - he didn't even particularly care who got the credit for successful policies. He was simply a man so infused by the values and ideals that fill the sails of the great American experiment that he awoke one morning in 1981 to find that his countrymen had placed him at the tiller. 
   It was this modesty in the face of great achievement that set Reagan apart from so many other presidents, who typically seek great credit for modest achievements. And it is part of what made him a hero and a role model for me. 
   Reagan's congenital congeniality masked a steely determination: to change the very mindset of the American people about the role of government, to win the battle against totalitarianism, and to unleash the potential of a free people to make the world a better place for themselves and others. By 1980, government really had become more of a problem than a solution to economic recession. The ""containment"" strategy for fighting the Cold War was really just a drawn-out way of losing it, when victory could be within our grasp. And America really does hold a special place in the world, and with it, a special burden to promote peace, freedom and opportunity. 
   It's hard now to even recall the atmosphere of malaise and fatalism that gripped the country at the end of the 1970s. It's hard to even believe that when Reagan took office the top marginal tax rate was 70 percent - a confiscatory level that simultaneously discouraged innovation and hard work while encouraging cheating and distortion of the marketplace. And we are blessed that an entire generation has now come of age with no firsthand experience living as hostages to the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, when two massive nuclear arsenals were poised to wipe out humanity at the touch of a button. 
   Ronald Reagan had the vision to see a better way, and the confidence that his fellow Americans needed only encouragement and a sense of hope to join with him. His rare gift was in using common language and common sense to articulate exactly what so many of us were thinking, in ways no one else could have but seemed so obvious in hindsight. 
   His philosophy of ""peace through strength"" not only convinced the Soviets they could not match us, but still serves today as the basis for our national security. Reagan believed in peace through strength rather than relying on the promises of adversaries in treaties and deals. ""Trust but verify"" typified his concern that we must always be in charge of our own destiny. 
   They called him the ""Great Communicator,"" but as Reagan himself said in his final address from the Oval Office: ""I never though it was my style or the words I used that made a difference: it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation - from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries."" 
   Ronald Wilson Reagan's life gave truth to the platitude that just one person - possessed with vision, integrity, the courage of his convictions and an unshakeable sense of optimism - really can change the world.

   Acknowledging that the U.S. trade deficit remains a concern, Kyl added, ""The present trade deficit is largely the result of strong economic growth in the United States compared with the rest of the developed world. The U.S. has the economic strength to purchase more goods and services from the global market than our competitors. Restricting the flow of trade would only make things worse: in fact, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan recently commented that efforts to do so, and hinder free markets generally, represent a 'truly worrisome' threat to global economic growth and prosperity."" 
   Because the Senate can only vote trade agreements up or down, the Finance Committee held a ""mock"" markup on CAFTA to provide advisory input to Bush Administration trade negotiators. Formal action by the full Senate on CAFTA is expected within a few weeks. The result is uncertain, however, as many groups, particularly the sugar industry, remain opposed.

  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) late Tuesday introduced S. 3499, the Stop Adults' Facilitation the Exploitation of Youth Act, or Internet SAFETY Act, which is intended to fight the rise of child pornography on the Internet.  
   The Internet SAFETY Act cracks down on Internet child pornography and related conduct by: creating new federal offenses targeted at those who produce it or knowingly facilitate its transmission; increasing penalties for child pornography, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse offenses; and increasing resources for prosecution and prevention of child sexual-abuse offenses.

Between 1998 and 2004, child-pornography reports made to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children increased from 3,267 to 106,119 - a 30-fold increase over a six-year period. The Justice Department also notes that the severity of abuse depicted in child pornography has escalated in recent years, ""with the images found today more frequently involving younger children - including toddlers and even infants."" 
   The report concludes that ""the nation should be alarmed at the fact that child pornography is being produced, possessed, and distributed in record numbers.""

  Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, which I chair, held a hearing on a major threat to the United States, not only from terrorists but from rogue nations like North Korea. 
   An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack over American soil, one of the expert witnesses at the hearing said, is one of only a few ways that America could be essentially defeated by our enemies, terrorist or otherwise. A single nuclear weapon, detonated at the right altitude, would produce an electromagnetic pulse that - depending on its location and size - would knock out power grids and other electrical systems across much of the country, for months if not years.  
   Few if any people would die right away. But the long-term loss of electricity would essentially bring our society to a halt. Communication would be almost impossible. Powerless refrigerators would leave food rotting in warehouses, marooned by a lack of transportation as those vehicles still operable simply run out of gas (which can't be pumped without electricity). The unavailability of clean water would quickly threaten public health, not to mention leave the inevitable fires raging unchecked. As we have seen in areas of natural and other disasters, this kind of scenario often results in a fairly rapid breakdown of social order. 
   Our society has grown so dependent on computer and other electrical systems that we have created our own Achilles' heel of vulnerability, ironically much more so than less developed nations. Deprived of power in occasional blackouts, we are in many ways helpless. Typically, power is restored relatively quickly, but a large-scale burnout caused by broad EMP attack would create a much more difficult situation. Not only would there be nobody nearby to help, it could take years to replace destroyed equipment. Transformers for regional substations, for example, are huge and are no longer manufactured in the United States. 
   Essentially those in the affected area would find themselves transported back to the United States of the 1880s, for months if not years - a threat that might sound straight out of Hollywood, but is very real. FBI Director Robert Mueller has confirmed new intelligence that suggests Al Qaeda is trying to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. Iran has surprised intelligence analysts by describing the mid-flight explosions of missiles fired from ships on the Caspian Sea as ""successful"" tests. North Korea exports missile technology around the world; SCUDs can easily be purchased on the open market for about $100,000 apiece. And Russia's rusting nuclear arsenal is highly vulnerable. 
   The attraction of an EMP attack to a terrorist organization is in its simplicity. Hitting a particular target, like a city, is difficult with a SCUD. But it is relatively simple to simply launch one, off a seagoing freighter for example, and detonate it at the right altitude. 
   Fortunately, preparing key infrastructure systems and stockpiling backup equipment like transformers is both feasible and relatively inexpensive, according to a comprehensive report on the EMP threat by a commission of prominent experts. But it will take leadership by the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, and other federal agencies, along with support from Congress, all of which has yet to materialize. 
   The landmark 9/11 Commission report stated that our biggest failure was one of ""imagination."" No one imagined that terrorists would do what they did on September 11. Today few can conceive of the possibility that terrorists could bring American society to its knees by knocking out our power supply from several miles in the atmosphere. But this time we've been warned, and we'd better be prepared to respond.

""We have two prime opportunities to interdict terrorists seeking to enter the United States: when travelers are issued visas, and when they enter the country,"" Kyl said at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security & Citizenship and Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology & Homeland Security. ""Any visa, but particularly one for an applicant from a high-risk country, should only be granted if we can be reasonably certain that the person in question will simply visit and then go home. If we're still not even personally interviewing those with questionable applications, it certainly leaves a gaping hole in our first line of defense.""  
   Kyl noted that 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001 were natives of Saudi Arabia who had entered the United States legally ""using visas that never should have been granted and that were in blatant violation of the spirit and the letter of U.S. immigration law."" He expressed exasperation that the State Department was still unable to provide, at the hearing, even an estimate of the number of personal interviews of visa applicants from countries such as Saudi Arabia, home of Wahabism, a particularly virulent and anti-American strain of Islam. 
   Kyl also expressed concern about the training of consular officers in screening foreign travelers, as well as the guidance that they receive from the State Department. Last year, he won passage of an amendment to intelligence reform legislation that was prompted by the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that most foreign nationals be personally interviewed by consular officers before they are issued visas.

  The U.S. Senate unanimously approved an amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution early Friday to fully fund a program that reimburses states and local governments for a portion of the costs associated with incarcerating illegal criminal aliens. The amendment was cosponsored by Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), a leading advocate for such reimbursements. 
   The amendment increased the budget allocation for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) to its fully authorized level of $950 million, the level set in a bill, now law, written by Sens. Kyl and Feinstein (D-CA). The President's budget zeroed out SCAAP funding. For the current fiscal year, Congress appropriated only $410 million, less than half of the authorized amount.
   ""Controlling illegal immigration is a federal responsibility, and when illegal immigration is not controlled, state and local governments, particularly in border states like Arizona, are saddled with the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens,"" said Kyl. ""The SCAAP program reimburses state and local governments for a share of these costs, and that is why it's important that we fund it.""
   The Senate Budget Resolution provides a spending blueprint that helps determine levels at which our government is funded.
   SCAAP reimburses states and localities for a share of the costs incurred for incarcerating criminal illegal aliens who have at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations of state or local law, and who are incarcerated for at least four consecutive days during the reporting period.

  Recent media reports show that the average U.S. retail gas price has risen to an all-time high, breaking $3 a gallon. I recently paid $3.04, 20 cents a gallon more than I paid two weeks ago. I know many other American families are also feeling the pinch.  
   These increased gas prices can be linked to a variety of factors. Recent news reports suggest that production shortages at a time of increased demand as we go into the summer months are to blame. But, more directly, the problem can be traced to a continuing lack of refining capacity and unexpected outages at the nation's oil refineries. 
   The price of a gallon of oil is still $10 below last year when prices spiked. Demand, however, has increased 2.3 percent from the same period last year, and existing refineries are unable to meet the ever-rising demand for gasoline. 
   Because of high costs, regulatory red tape, and public opposition, refiners haven't built a new facility for more than 30 years, since 1976. The system is under such strain that consumers quickly feel any outages or disruptions. For instance, after Hurricane Katrina damaged refineries in the Gulf, prices nationwide went up 45 cents in just one week. 
   The lack of domestic refining capacity also increases our reliance on foreign sources of refined gasoline. America now imports about a million barrels of gasoline every day--that means that about one of every 10 gallons of gas Americans get at the pump is refined in a foreign country. 
   Last year when prices spiked, Republicans saw the strain on the existing system, and we tried to do something about it by addressing the lack of domestic refinery capacity. We introduced legislation to help streamline and incentivize the construction of new refineries, but Democrats ultimately blocked our efforts. 
   We were finally able to pass legislation that opened new areas in the deep waters off the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas exploration to bring more supply on line, but that will take roughly 18 months to start showing results. Republicans nevertheless, recognize that it is in our national security interest to increase domestic supply, including exploration in Alaska's ANWR, to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. 
   I also introduced legislation last year to ensure that oil companies pay their fair share for the oil and gas they produce from public lands. I expect a version of this bill to pass this year. And I also introduced legislation to remove the 54-cent import tariff on ethanol, to help lower the price consumers pay at the pump. 
   The only way we are going to be able to provide relief in the near term is to increase supply by reducing our reliance on imported energy, producing more of it domestically, and relieving some of the regulatory impediments that have made it impossible to create a new refinery in this country in the last 30 years. 
   Republicans believe we ought to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to relieve the pain at the pump of working men and women and families all across this country.

  By Jon Kyl
   On November 15 America's seniors can start enrolling in the new, voluntary Medicare prescription drug program, which will begin dispensing its first medicine at the start of next year.  
   Formal notices to those eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare have been mailed out and should have been received by now. The yellow publication offers information about changes in drug coverage, and explains that those who do not choose a plan by the end of the year will be enrolled in one automatically unless they choose not to be. It should also provide notification of which plan is the default, and what it will cost. 
   Anyone who hasn't received their mailing can find the information on the Internet. 
   For those undecided on a drug coverage plan, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently unveiled new features on its Web site, including a ""Medicare Prescription Plan Drug Finder,"" which allows beneficiaries to compare features, such as annual cost, deductibles, premiums and co-payments, for their specific needs. Such a direct, ""apples-to-apples"" comparison has never before been available, and seniors can choose from as few or as many options as they want. 
   It's critical to be as informed as possible, because some inaccurate rumors have circulated that could discourage participation in the program. When it was first enacted as part of broad Medicare reform in 2003, critics complained that it offered too little help on prescription drugs to be of much benefit to anyone. A few months later, many of those same critics were warning that the program threatened to break the federal budget. Both allegations are false, and it's worth bearing in mind that many of those critics had partisan motivations. 
   It is true that the new prescription drug coverage will not cover all costs of all drugs for all people eligible for Medicare. It is also true that some of the rules of the system can be complex. However, there are 10 million reasons to focus on the benefits - the 10 million Americans who have no prescription drug coverage at all today. Under the new law, they will soon be eligible for substantial help. 
   Multiple plans have been approved for each of the Medicare-designated regions across the country, and as of October 1 they have been competing with each other for enrollees based on cost, coverage and convenience. (All will allow prescriptions to be filled at local pharmacies or by mail, and cover both brand name and generic medicines). 
   In addition to the stand-alone plans, in most regions people with Medicare will be able to select managed care plans that combine drug coverage and other health care services. Initial estimates are that more than 40 percent of beneficiaries will have access to a prescription drug plan with a monthly premium of less than $10, and 93 percent will have access to one below $15. Nearly half of the plans will offer enhanced coverage, such as low or no deductibles, lower co-payments, or little or no gap in coverage. Every single state has at least one stand-alone plan with no deductible. 
   The new prescription drug program will not solve all of the challenges facing Medicare. But for many of Arizona's 800,000 beneficiaries, it could make the difference between being able to afford prescription drugs, and not. The new benefit is a major addition to a bedrock institution upon which millions of seniors depend. As with all big changes, there will be glitches, and some things may seem confusing at first. But there will be plenty of opportunities to review progress and adjust as needed. 
   In his State of the Union address two years ago, President Bush declared that ""health-care reform must begin with Medicare"" because ""Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society."" Providing prescription drug benefit coverage, for the first time ever, demonstrates our commitment to that principle.

  Sen. Jon Kyl today introduced legislation to stimulate the construction of new refineries, particularly to replace the capacity lost as a result of Hurricane Katrina.

   ""Reduce refining capacity causes gas prices to go up. We can reverse that trend with this legislation,"" Kyl said. ""Our petroleum infrastructure is aging and near capacity under the best of circumstances - we haven't built a new refinery in nearly three decades. Tax relief that focuses on improving the quantity and reliability of supply, without adversely affecting the environment, will help prevent a repeat of what happened at the pump after Katrina, and help bring prices back down to earth."" 
   Kyl's bill would allow companies to write off, in the first year it goes online, the cost of building a new refinery, rebuilding one destroyed by Katrina, or installing new equipment in an existing facility that increases overall output by 5 percent or more. A similar provision was included in the Senate version of the recent energy bill but reduced to 50 percent in conference before being signed into law by President Bush. Kyl's bill would also provide tax relief for companies that invest in refining ""heavy sour crude,"" which is increasingly replacing ""light sweet light crude"" in world markets.

KYL APPLAUDS DHS EXPANSION OF ?EXPEDITED REMOVAL' ALONG SOUTHWEST BORDER
  Sen. Jon Kyl today praised the announcement that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to expand ""expedited removal"" authority from three to nine Border Patrol sectors, effectively implementing the policy along the entire southwest border.  
   Under the expedited removal process, apprehended ""other-than-Mexican"" (OTM) illegal aliens are returned quickly to their country of origin and no longer released into the United States to await court processing of their cases. 
   ""Expedited removal has proven extremely effective in reducing the number of OTMs attempting to enter the United States illegally in the three areas where it has been implemented,"" said Kyl, who called for the program to be expanded in June after co-chairing a hearing at which DHS and Border Patrol officials testified that the Border Patrol had apprehended 98,000 OTMs in FY05, 175 percent more than during the comparable period in FY04, which was itself a record year. 
   Despite the fact that many of the 100-plus countries from which they came are known to host terrorist organizations, officials also testified at the hearing, approximately 70 percent of those OTMs were released on their own recognizance in sectors without expedited removal, for lack of a place to keep them. 
   ""Given the frightening scenario of a potential terrorist being caught and then simply released into the U.S., expanding expedited removal is an obvious priority,"" Kyl said. Along with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), he has sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes 10,000 new beds over 5 years to help deal with the increase in detentions. 
   The three sectors where expedited removal is already in place are Tucson, AZ, McAllen, TX and Laredo, TX.

KYL: PROTECTING PRIVATE PROPERTY IN THE WAKE OF KELO
  Earlier this summer the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that local governments can use the constitutional power of eminent domain to forcibly acquire private property, not just for roads and other traditional ""public use"" projects, but for anything the government determines to be in the ""public good."" 
   The ""public good,"" according to the ruling in Kelo v. City of New London, turns out to include shopping centers and other economic development projects that increase a government's tax base. This approach has been used in the past to improve severely blighted neighborhoods, with relatively little objection; but in Kelo, the court ruled that the city of New London, CT could condemn property in a decidedly unblighted working-class neighborhood so that private developers could build condominiums, a luxury hotel, a health club and private offices that would generate significantly higher tax revenues.  
   The Fifth Amendment forbids private property from being taken ""for public use without just compensation."" Every state constitution echoes those words, which were surely given great consideration by the Contitution's framers. As columnist George Will puts it, the framers ""clearly intended the adjective 'public' to circumscribe government's power: Government should take private property only to create things - roads, bridges, parks, public buildings - directly owned or primarily used by the general public."" 
    When the Kelo case was argued, Justice Antonin Scalia summarized New London's more expansive interpretation as: ""You can take from A and give to B if B pays more taxes."" A majority of his colleagues apparently agreed with this argument. 
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined with Scalia in opposition, writing that the fallout of the verdict ""will not be random,"" and that the beneficiaries are likely to be those ""with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms"" - usually at the expense of individuals of more modest means. ""The specter of condemnation hangs over all property,"" O'Connor added. ""Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory."" The Wall Street Journal was even more succinct, calling the decision: ""A reverse Robin Hood ... take from the poor, give to the rich."" 
   ""That prospect helps explain the unusual coalition supporting the property owners in the case,"" the Journal added, ""ranging from the libertarian Institute for Justice (the lead lawyers) to the NAACP, AARP and the late Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The latter three groups signed an amicus brief arguing that eminent domain has often been used against politically weak communities with high concentrations of minorities and elderly. Justice Thomas's opinion cites a wealth of data to that effect."" Of course, those whose properties are confiscated by their local governments retain a constitutional right to ""just compensation,"" typically interpreted to mean market value. But that is a very elastic term. And it ignores the less tangible, but often more powerful, impact of the loss of one's home and community. The properties to be seized in New London, for example, include small businesses that have been in families for generations. 
   Even when the use of eminent domain is unavoidable, it is an awesome power that government should use cautiously and with great restraint. That's why I have cosponsored the Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act, legislation that would prohibit the use of federal dollars in eminent domain projects pursued for economic development alone. I am also researching other ways that Congress can act to better protect private property from state and local governments. 
   Arizona already has a state constitutional provision designed to prevent such abuse of eminent domain: Article 2, section 17 provides that ""private property shall not be taken for private use,"" and the Arizona Court of Appeals has interpreted that to mean that the ultimate use of ""taken"" property must be truly public - schools, roads, and the like. Other states are quickly following our example. 
   Meanwhile, the federal government can also do its part by passing our bill.

  Sen. Jon Kyl today expressed cautious optimism after a meeting with Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Administrator Stephen Johnson on federal assistance for rural western water providers to meet new standards under the Clean Water Act.  
   The meeting focused on a new rule that lowers the limit for arsenic in drinking water from 50 to 10 parts per billion (ppb). The rule has vexed many Western water providers because arsenic occurs naturally in the ground, generally at higher levels than the rest of the United States. Residents there have been drinking local water for generations with no known health effects. Meanwhile, the infrastructure costs required to meet the 10 ppb standard have proven drastically higher than EPA estimates, and would result in monthly utility bill increases of up to 500 percent in some communities. 
   Arizona ranks second in the country in the number of systems affected by the new standard, which takes effect on January 23, 2006. Beyond securing federal assistance, Kyl and other western senators reached an agreement with Johnson that water providers working jointly and in good faith with the EPA will not be fined for missing the January 23 deadline. 
   ""Stephen Johnson understands that one-size-fits-all approaches to implementation of the new standard don't work, and that we need a framework to protect public health while at the same time giving these communities the flexibility they need to comply,"" Kyl said.

  I recently wrote a column about the need to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). In this week's column, I'd like to discuss the legislative proposals the Senate will consider in January. 
   The Senate Intelligence Committee worked hard to address the problems posed by changes in communications technology and, after numerous hearings and countless hours of internal deliberations, produced a serious effort to solve these problems. The strength of that effort to work together to improve FISA is apparent in the overwhelming 13 to 2 vote by which the committee was able to pass a bill.  
   Nevertheless, the committee's bill contains one very troublesome provision that has come to be known as the ""Wyden Amendment."" This provision would require a warrant for any overseas surveillance that is conducted for foreign intelligence purposes and targets a U.S. citizen or a foreign national who holds a U.S. green card. 
   The Wyden amendment is unnecessary, it is overly broad, and it threatens to undermine overseas intelligence gathering. Under current law, a warrant generally would not be required for overseas surveillance targeted at a U.S. person if the surveillance is conducted for purposes of a criminal investigation. The Wyden amendment would create a situation in which a warrant would be required in order to monitor an overseas terrorist group that includes some U.S. citizens or green-card holders, under some circumstances in which no warrant would be required to monitor the very same people - or even a group composed exclusively of U.S. citizens - if that group were suspected of drug trafficking or money laundering! It should not be more burdensome to monitor al Qaeda terrorists than it is to monitor drug dealers. 
   The Wyden amendment is also likely to damage overseas counterterrorism investigations by hindering cooperation with foreign intelligence services. In many cases, the best intelligence that the United States obtains about al-Qaeda comes from foreign governments' intelligence agencies. Particularly in the Middle East, these governments frequently are afraid of al-Qaeda, or of radicalized elements of their own populations, and they are anxious to ensure that it not be made known that they are cooperating with the United States in the war against terrorists. Thus, when these foreign governments share intelligence with the United States, they often demand strict assurances that the information will not be disseminated outside of the U.S. intelligence community. 
    The Wyden requirement would cost the United States information and cooperation from foreign intelligence services, possibly valuable information that is not available from any other source. If this Wyden language can be repaired, the Intelligence Committee bill would be a good starting point from which the Senate could work. 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee produced the second legislative proposal, which takes a very different and (in my view) destructive approach. Among its many problems, the Judiciary Committee version of the bill would limit overseas intelligence gathering under FISA to ""communications to which at least one party is a specific individual target who is reasonably believed outside of the United States."" That is unduly limiting. Here's an example: if the U.S. military were planning to enter and occupy an enemy-occupied city in Iraq, and the night before the invasion the commanding officer asked that all communications into or out of the city be monitored, this provision would bar such surveillance. The enemy forces inside the city, unless identified as including at least one ""specific individual target,"" would have privacy rights against the United State Army, courtesy of the U.S. Congress! 
   In the end, Congress will need to write a law that adequately updates FISA to keep pace with the evolving technology terrorists uses to communicate. The Intelligence Committee bill should be where the Senate will begin its debate, but changes are necessary.

KYL, FEINSTEIN BILL RAISING PENALTIES FOR IDENTITY THEFT
  President George W. Bush today signed into law the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, legislation co-sponsored by sens. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA) designed to stiffen penalties for the crime of identity theft. 
   ""Last year alone, nearly 10 million Americans had their identities stolen by criminals who rob them and the nation's businesses of nearly $50 billion through fraudulent transactions. The bill I'm about to sign sends a clear message that a person who violates another's financial privacy will be punished,"" President Bush said at the signing ceremony, as he thanked Kyl and Feinstein, among others for their work on the bill.
   Under current law, many identity thieves receive short terms of imprisonment or probation and, after their release, go on to use false identities to commit much more serious crimes. H.R. 1731, the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, increases penalties for those who steal identities to commit immigration violations, firearms offenses, and other serious crimes. The bill also amends current law to impose a higher maximum penalty for identity theft used to facilitate acts of terrorism.
   ""There are few crimes short of actual violence that inspire greater dread than identity theft,"" Kyl said. ""It's not just the hassle, or even the lost money. It's the profound sense of violation that comes with having someone else out there actively sullying your good name.""
   Provisions of the legislation would help address the growing problem of insiders who use their employment position (such as workers at financial institutions) to commit fraud or help others commit fraud, allowing judges to apply additional penalties to these individuals under the sentencing guidelines.
   The bill requires two or more years in jail - beyond any term of imprisonment for the underlying offense - for individuals who knowingly transfer, possess, or use the means of identification of another person in order to commit a serious Federal predicate offense (including immigration violations, false citizenship crimes, firearms offenses, and other serious violations). Judges would be prohibited from sentencing a convicted defendant to probation or reducing the underlying term of imprisonment.
   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received 161,819 victim complaints of someone using another's information in 2002. Of these, 22 percent involved more than one type of identity crime. The FTC estimates the loss to businesses and financial institutions from identity theft to be $47.6 billion. The costs to individual consumers are about $5 billion.
   In October, Mohamed Amry, a former employee of a Bally's Health Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to a multi-count indictment charging him with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, access-device fraud, and conspiracy to commit identity theft. Using a skimmer to obtain credit-card data from members of the health club, Amry provided stolen names, Social Security numbers, and credit-card information from at least 30 people to Abdelghani Meskini, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in connection with the plot to blow up Los Angeles International Airport in 1999.

""We've learned in recent months that the border can be brought under control with the right resources and a sustained level of commitment. There's more work to be done, but this money moves us closer to where we need to be."" 
   The subcommittee directed the department to use the money to hire 1,000 more border agents, in addition to 500 new positions funded by an emergency appropriations bill last month (both pushed heavily by Kyl), in order to reach the goal of 10,000 more agents over the next 10 years. Subcommittee Chairman Judd Gregg, R-N.H. said the Homeland Security Department also would spend the increased funding on expanding training facilities, adding 2,200 more detention beds to hold illegal immigrants and increase the number of U.S. Customs and immigration enforcement officers. Gregg pledged that ""Within a ... year and a half, we will effectively detain anyone entering the country illegally,"" a goal Kyl has stressed consistently for years. 
   The bill also includes further development of cost-saving technology along the border, and $55 million for tactical infrastructure (such as roads, barriers and lights) in Arizona. Overall, it would provide the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with $30.8 billion in discretionary spending for the department and its programs. 
   ""We'll continue to work with the Appropriations Committee and the Senate leadership on the overall border enforcement issue, particularly for the hard-hit areas of Arizona,"" said Kyl, who recently released (along with Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX) draft language on the enforcement and funding provisions of a comprehensive immigration reform bill the two plan to introduce this summer. ""More help is on the way.""

KYL BACKS EFFORTS TO REIN IN FEDERAL SPENDING
  Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz) today will join Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg (R-NH) to introduce the Stop Over-Spending (SOS) Act of 2006, which is designed to rein in federal spending, reduce the deficit, and regain control of the federal budget process.  
   ""Although the government is currently seeing record amounts of tax revenue as a result of Republican pro-growth tax policies, we still must govern in a fiscally-sound way, and curb out-of-control spending that threatens the health of our economic future,"" said Kyl. 
   The SOS Act provides: a line-item veto process that allows the President to identify wasteful pork-barrel spending, ask that it be rescinded, and return it to Congress for expedited consideration; a new mechanism to balance the budget by 2012; reinstates statutory caps on discretionary spending; the formation of two new bi-partisan commissions, one to study the accountability and efficiency of government programs, and the other to examine and provide solutions to the impending entitlement crisis. 
   ""Clearly, American taxpayers cannot be asked to send more of their hard-earned dollars to Washington than they already are sending, said Kyl. ""Congress must make the necessary decisions now to bring entitlement spending under control. The SOS Act will provide for automatic sequestration if Congress fails to take necessary steps through the legislative process. It will provide meaningful tools to reign in both mandatory and discretionary government spending."" 
   Entitlement spending, excluding interest on the debt, now represents 56 percent of all federal spending. Left unchecked, that will grow to more than 62 percent in 10 years. This path is unsustainable, and no amount of tax increases - setting aside their damaging effect on the economy - could make up the difference.

   ""Since the day he entered Congress, Senator Kyl has been a stalwart supporter of physicians in Arizona and throughout the entire country,"" said Chic Older, Executive Vice President of the Arizona Medical Association. ""He cares about patients and the public health, and he understands the concerns of doctors who care for these patients."" 
   Senator Kyl was nominated for the award by several groups, including the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Arizona Medical Association and the Arizona Osteopathic Association. Kyl has been a leader in the Senate in ensuring the doctors receive adequate reimbursement from the government so that they can provide quality care to patients. Last year Kyl was able to prevent a scheduled 4.4 percent cut in physician reimbursements, enabling more physicians to continue to treat Medicare patients. Kyl has also been a leader in the Senate fighting for litigation reform. Kyl has secured funding for important Arizona medical initiatives like the Translational Genomics Institute in Phoenix; and has voted for increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. Kyl also won a provision in the 2003 Medicare reform bill to begin reimbursing hospitals for federally mandated services provided to illegal immigrants. Arizona providers are slated to receive $180 million, or up to $45 million per year, in federal reimbursement.

  As part of his comprehensive approach to border security and immigration policy reforms, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) today successfully added an amendment to the Concurrent Budget Resolution for 2007 that designates an additional $2 billion in funding for interior enforcement initiatives.  
   ""The $2 billion in no way covers all the expenses that need to be covered, but represents a down payment on the work that needs to be done to prepare for comprehensive immigration reform"" said Kyl. ""Whatever Congress does this year, we're going to have to begin the process of adding the personal and tools necessary to enforce the laws."" 
   The measure adopted designates $2 billion in immigration and homeland security-related funding for interior enforcement purposes. It would specifically fund a nationwide implementation of the Electronic Employment Verification System and a hardened work-authorization Social Security card, which is a major component of Kyl's comprehensive immigration reform proposal. Kyl's provision would also add an additional 3,000 worksite enforcement personnel (including enforcement, fraud detection, and all support personnel), that would monitor and penalize the hiring and employment of illegal immigrants. 
   ""Any immigration bill that passes Congress this year will fail unless we have the interior enforcement mechanisms and personnel in place to enforce the laws,"" said Kyl. ""Comprehensive immigration reform requires a commitment to interior enforcement policies that compliment the strengthening of our border security infrastructure."" 
   The measure would also provide funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), an initiative that reimburses states and localities for their costs associated with incarcerating criminal illegal aliens; increases the total number of federal detention bed spaces and personnel; and increases the number of Border Patrol agents to 3,000 provided in 2007. 
   ""State and local jails and prisons, particularly in border states like Arizona, must bear the heavy cost of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens,"" said Kyl. ""This burden is a federal responsibility, and I am pleased this funding will provide the much needed relief to state and local governments.""

   ""As I've always contended, the federal government must expend whatever resources are necessary to gain operational control of our border, and that includes taking the steps necessary to help streamline the flow of traffic coming across our borders,"" said Kyl. ""Unless adequate resources are appropriated to help improve ports of entry, economic growth and security in the entire region could be adversely affected."" 
   The Nogales-Mariposa port of entry will receive $13.694 million to help reconfigure its infrastructure to better handle the increased traffic coming through the port. The port was initially intended to handle 400 trucks per day but currently processes in excess of 1,400 trucks per day. 
   Kyl also secured $42.029 million for construction of a new port of entry, San Luis II. The current San Luis station has experienced a 235 percent increase in commercial traffic since its initial construction. 
   Kyl has collaborated for many years with federal, state and local leaders to secure adequate funding to complete San Luis II and Nogales projects so that the Yuma and Nogales areas, as well as the entire, state can benefit from the latest advances in port technology.

  Mother's Day kicks off a very important week for health care, one that focuses specifically on the health issues that face American women. National Women's Health Week, coordinated by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is intended to encourage women to concentrate on taking the simple steps that will improve their overall health and enable them to live a longer and happier life. 
   Women are a source of strength in their families. Sometimes this means taking care of others - a spouse, children, parents - and selflessly considering their own health needs last. As part of Women's Health Week, I urge the women of Arizona to take the time to visit their doctor on National Women's Check-Up Day, which is Monday, May 15. Sometimes it's the deadliest diseases that go unnoticed until the damage has already been done.  
   The conventional wisdom is that breast cancer, a terrible disease, is the number one killer of women - but it is not. Heart disease - often described as a silent killer - is in fact the leading cause of death in American women. According to the American Heart Association in 2004, 15,418 women died of cardiovascular disease in Arizona alone, which includes all forms of heart disease, compared to 664 women who died of breast cancer. Women must not ignore the warning signs, and in consultation with their medical provider, understand the factors that place them at risk. 
   Along with understanding the diseases that women face, Women's Health Week is also intended to raise public awareness of women's health issues by encouraging women across the nation to become engaged in the policy discussions that affect women. Congressional and regulatory actions in Washington D.C. affect the health of women in very significant ways. It is important for women to be informed and participate in the decision-making process to ensure their voices are heard. 
   For example, thousands of women across the country have become engaged in the issue of hormone replacement therapy, and whether it is advisable to undergo it. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing its policies on hormone replacement therapy. Pharmacies and women across the country have become active by publicly sharing their stories on the need for alternative drug treatments, in the hopes the FDA will recognize the importance of this treatment. If you have questions of comments about this, please contact my office. 
   This week across the country women will be participating in races and walk-a-thons, forming support groups, participating in clinical trials and research, and bringing their experiences to the attention of Congressional leaders. These are all positive ways to get involved. 
   This week we also celebrate National Nurses Week, a chance to thank the nurses across the United States for the dedication and excellent healthcare they provide to others. Whether it is assisting patients in rehabilitation facilities, working with physicians in hospitals to respond to emergencies, or providing healthcare to students in schools, all nurses provide critical care in some form with compassion. My wife, Caryll, is a former nurse, so I know firsthand nurses' contributions our nation's health. I am grateful to the many people who honor the nursing profession with their service. 
   Unfortunately, a big threat to the healthcare profession is causing many to leave the field. Our healthcare professionals are continually threatened by the surging cost of liability insurance, causing many healthcare providers to close their practices, and deterring prospective providers from the profession. While negligent providers should be held accountable for their mistakes, we must also find ways to differentiate legitimate cases from the frivolous ones. The New England Journal of Medicine released a report recently, showing that about 40 percent of medical malpractice cases filed in the United States are groundless - yet these suits increases liability insurance for our medical professionals to struggle to provide quality health care services. The Senate last week attempted to address this issue; but, mostly on party line votes, Senators again denied a vote on this critically important issue. 
   There is always more to do to improve our health. Focusing on these issuing during these weeks reminds us of these challenges. Finally, I hope all Arizona mothers enjoyed their day on Sunday.

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Just before Iraqi and coalition troops launched the long-awaited battle to retake the city of Fallujah from lawless insurgents, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan issued a letter that, as the Los Angeles Times put it, illustrates ""a fundamental disagreement between the US-led coalition and the U.N. about how best to bring stability to Iraq."" It goes to the heart of the larger question of the post-9/11 world: how civilized societies should confront the reality of a large, international network of radical Islamists whose goal is our annihilation and whose principal tool is terrorism.  
   This great conflict is tragic and frightening, but not altogether without precedent. Adolph Hitler's vision of Nazi domination presented to European leaders in the 1930s a similar choice between aggressive confrontation and appeasement, provoking a debate with eerie similarities to today's. 
   Under normal circumstances, of course, peace is the heartfelt desire of all honorable men and women who seek only to live in freedom and in harmony with their neighbors. But as Hitler proved, sometimes accommodation is not an option. Or, as Tolstoy put it, ""You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you."" 
   President Bush and his allies in Congress and abroad have looked squarely into the eyes of radical Islamic fundamentalists and arrived at the measured conclusion that, ultimately, there can be no compromise between our way of life and theirs. Given the stated desire of groups such as al Qaeda to impose universal sharia, or traditional Islamic law, and to slaughter those who object - not to mention their demonstrated willingness to commit suicide in the process - there is simply no 'middle ground.' 
   Unfortunately, as in the years before World War II, there are those who will go to great lengths to avoid confronting such unpleasant realities. Which brings us back to Kofi Annan's letter, addressed to President Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and interim Iraqi leader Ayad Allawi. 
   In it, Annan voiced his increasing concern at the ""prospect of an escalation in violence,"" particularly the reports of major military offensives being planned for Falluja. ""Ultimately,"" Annan argued, ""the problem of insecurity can only be addressed through dialogue and an inclusive political process."" 
   It boggles the mind that a world leader could display such naivete in the face of efforts by thousands of insurgents and foreign fighters to terrorize and impose a Taliban-style rule in Fallujah, complete with summary executions. Reaction from those on the ground was swift and angry. ""I don't know what pressure he has to bear on the insurgents,"" Allawi said in an interview with the BBC. ""If he can stop them from inflicting damage and killing Iraqis, then he's welcome."" Later, Allawi responded formally to Annan, in a letter so forceful it merits an extended excerpt: 
   ""You suggested that the prospect of an escalation in violence could be very disruptive to Iraq's political transition. I share this view. But I believe that this argues for taking firm steps now to tackle the violence we face today. Unchecked, this violence will escalate... At the moment, we have parts of the country in which the civilian population has been hijacked by the terrorists and insurgents operating from places like Fallujah [who] are exporting their violence to other parts of the country. 
   I was a little surprised by the lack of any mention in your letter of the atrocities which these groups have committed. ... The same group who murdered so many of your staff in the bombing of the UN headquarters last year, has since murdered hundreds of innocent Iraqis and committed countless other atrocities. 
   I share your strong preference for a political solution over military confrontation. But I did not find in your letter a new plan or a new strategy beyond this strong preference. 
   Essentially, the violent groups have rejected the rule-of-law, without which there can be no democracy. I am not prepared to allow these groups a veto over democracy in Iraq, nor to continue to terrorize the vast majority of Iraqis who want to live in peace and freedom. 
   The conclusion is unavoidable that, in the words of the Heritage Foundation, ""While Iraqis are dying in large numbers at the hands of Al-Qaeda backed foreign fighters and former Baathists, the UN leader's chief concern appears to be the need to negotiate with the insurgents and open 'a new chapter of inclusiveness and national reconciliation.' Annan's letter will give aid and comfort to some of the most barbaric terrorists of modern times."" 
   This is particularly galling given the massive scandal over the UN-administered Oil-for-Food program, and the Security Council's utter failure to deal with Saddam Hussein's tyrannical regime and his flouting of endless UN resolutions, its lack of leadership in disarming Iran, and its paralysis in the face of genocide in the Sudan. Worse, the US government has repeatedly asked the United Nations to provide more experts to help prepare for Iraq's January elections, but Annan - who apparently has no sense of irony - has limited the staff in Iraq to 35 until they can be guaranteed better protection. 
   Last week, the State Department announced that the nation of Georgia would send 691 troops to Iraq as part of a special UN security force. Tiny Fiji has committed another 170 troops to protect UN workers and facilities. One hopes that the leader of the so-called ""world body"" can take heart from the bravery of these small, poor nations and decide that it's time to play a role in Iraq that does more good than harm.

  Sen. Jon Kyl today co-sponsored, along with sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Carl Levin (D-MI), an amendment to clarify the review process for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and limit the access to U.S. courts of non-citizen terrorists held there.  
   ""As a society, we have an obligation to provide a meaningful legal process for prisoners in the war against terrorism - even to those who would kill us all in an instant if given half a chance,"" Kyl said. ""That commitment is one of the things that makes America worth defending. But it is by no means the same thing as giving foreign terrorists all the rights and privileges of American citizens, particularly when we're in a state of war."" 
   The amendment would codify the traditional assumption, overturned by the recent Supreme Court decision in Rasul v. Bush, that the federal habeas corpus statute does not grant aliens detained outside the United States as enemy combatants the unfettered right to petition U.S. federal courts. The amendment would, instead, allow limited judicial review of military courts' decisions at Guantanamo. 
   A Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) system now allows detainees at Guantanamo to challenge their designation as enemy combatants, and the status of each is assessed annually by an Administrative Review Board (ARB) that includes three disinterested military officers; one is a judge advocate senior ranking officer who serves as president of the tribunal. Each detainee is assigned a military officer as a personal representative who assists in hearing preparation. Detainees have the right to testify before the tribunal, call witnesses, and introduce any other evidence. The ARB makes a recommendation to a Designated Civilian Official (DCO) - currently Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England - who makes the final decision whether to release, transfer, or continue to detain the individual. Those determined not to be enemy combatants are transferred to their country of citizenship or other location consistent with domestic and international obligations and U.S. foreign policy. 
   This process meets the conditions of the Geneva Convention, despite the fact that members of Al Qaeda do not qualify for Geneva protections for multiple reasons. The amendment, offered to the Department of Defense Authorization bill, strengthens the system by forbidding the tribunals from considering information obtained via undue coercion, and by directing the Secretary of Defense to notify the relevant Congressional committee of procedural modifications within 60 days. 
   The amendment provides a CSRT appellate procedure, granting exclusive jurisdiction to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the validity of any decision of the DCO. For an enemy combatant to be able to present an appeal, he must be detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, and a CSRT must first have been conducted. The scope of the subject matter review of an appeal is limited to whether the CSRT status determination was consistent with the procedures and standards specified, and whether subjecting an alien enemy combatant to such procedures and standards is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. 
   Separately, the amendment provides for a DC Circuit Court review of final decisions of military commissions authorized by President Bush in certain instances for enemy combatants. This right of appeal is automatic for capital cases and those in which the alien enemy combatant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years or more. It is discretionary regarding other cases, and is limited to aliens detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay for whom a final decision has been rendered by a military commission. Its scope is limited to whether the final decision of the military commission was consistent with specified procedures; and whether subjecting an alien enemy combatant to such a military commission is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. 
   ""It's important to make clear that this amendment does not change the habeas rights of American citizens,"" Kyl said. ""It's simply a necessary clarification since, for the first time in our history, foreign terrorists in large numbers have begun to claim the same benefits as citizens under the Constitution and our laws and treaties."" 
   More than 160 habeas cases have been brought on behalf of approximately 300 Guantanamo detainees in the DC Circuit Court. Without reform, all 500 detainees at the facility could demand a trial on whether the government correctly classified them as enemy combatants. Michael Ratner, a lawyer for numerous Guantanamo detainees, has boasted that this litigation has undermined intelligence gathering in the war on terror, telling Mother Jones magazine in March that: 
   ""The litigation is brutal for [the Untied States]. It's huge. We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small firms working to represent these detainees. Every time an attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder [for the U.S. military] to do what they're doing. You can't run an interrogation...with attorneys. What are they going to do now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down there?""
   ""Obviously,"" Kyl said, ""we don't want terrorists suing our own troops to prevent the perfectly appropriate interrogation of detainees.""

  Sen. Jon Kyl urged quick passage of legislation to modify the boundaries of a historic area of Yuma today at a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on National Parks.  
   The Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area Boundary Adjustment Act (S. 505), also sponsored by Sen. John McCain, amends the legislation passed in 2000 to adjust the boundary of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area to conform to the lines set forth in the Heritage Area Management Plan approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 2002. 
   The Yuma Crossing Heritage Area was designated in October 2000, the product of a preliminary concept plan completed in 1999 by the Heritage Area Task Force. The boundaries proposed in that plan included approximately 22 square miles, extending from the Colorado River on the north and west to the Avenue 7E alignment on the east and the 12th street alignment on the south. 
   ""These boundaries represented the task force's 'best guess' at the time as to the cultural landscape warranting inclusion in the heritage area,"" Kyl said. ""During the development of the final Heritage Area Management Plan, which was subject to comprehensive community involvement, it became apparent that the boundaries were too large and should be more concentrated along the Colorado River and in historic downtown. Rather than simply leave the boundaries as they were set in the 2000 legislation, we have heard from the community in Yuma that it is important to conform the boundaries to those in the agreed-upon Management Plan. 
   ""Doing so will provide certainty to the heritage area and those private landowners who live within its current boundaries,"" Kyl added. ""It will allow the heritage area to meet its management goals and responsibilities without the worry that private property rights may be affected in the future. It is a non-controversial, straightforward correction, and I hope my colleagues will work with me to pass it quickly this year.""

   I have visited Indian detention facilities in Arizona and have witnessed firsthand their deplorable and unsafe conditions. It has negatively affected many of the Indian tribes in Arizona. Take, for example, the Navajo Nation. It is approximately the size of West Virginia and has a population of more than 250,000. Because a number of the Nation's detention facilities have been closed for health and safety reasons, it only has 59 jail beds. This incredibly low number, which the Nation estimates represents less than 10 percent of its needs, leads to severe overcrowding. 
   The Navajo Nation has stated that overcrowded jails cause the majority of tribal court judges to defer or reduce sentences. In many cases, the Nation has no choice but to release and return serious offenders to their community in a matter of hours. 
   Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to tragic results. 
   For instance, according to the Chinle Police Department, in early 2007, a Navajo man was arrested for the third time for domestic violence and aggravated assault of his wife. Due to a lack of jail space, the offender was released to make room for new arrestees. The offender immediately returned home and beat his wife so brutally she had to be hospitalized. 
   These problems are not unique to the Navajo Nation. Indeed, many other tribes in Arizona are facing similar problems and are forced to release offenders prematurely. 
   When offenders are released, it is nearly impossible for tribes to protect their communities and enforce the rule of law. The Nation has testified before Congress that the current system creates a revolving door for offenders, which leads to a complete lack of respect and disregard for the tribal criminal justice system. More important, it results in unsafe communities in and around Indian Country. 
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs and Justice Department can take a number of actions to improve the conditions of tribal detention facilities, though whether these conditions improve largely depends on the level of federal funding for tribal jails. 
   Consequently, I have advocated increased funding for tribal detention facilities in Arizona. Thankfully, congressional funding committees have recently recognized the deplorable conditions of Indian detention facilities and recommended increased funding for Indian jails. The Administration, however, must also make this issue a priority and include sufficient funding in its budget to address this crisis in Indian Country. If immediate action is not taken, crime rates on the reservation will continue to remain high and the communities in and around the reservations will be neither safe nor secure.

August 10, 2005
(KALISPELL)  Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today praised President Bush for signing into law the new multi-billion highway construction bill that will bring more than $2.3 billion to Montana for highway construction projects. 
Baucus was invited to attend the bill signing but instead spent the day in Kalispell dispensing checks for funding he included in the bill for the Kalispell Bypass and Going-to-the-Sun Road. Baucus, a coauthor of the bill, said the funds will not only help create and keep more than 18,000 good-paying jobs per year in the state but will help make roads safer and more efficient. Baucus bill represents a 44 percent increase for Montana over the last highway bill, which expired in 2003. He said the funds will help make the states roads safer, create jobs, and boost Montanas economy.  This is about creating good-paying jobs for Montana, said Baucus, Montanas senior U.S. Senator. Montana really hit the jackpot with this bill. Were going to provide a shot-in-the-arm to Montanas economy by more than $2 billion over the next few years. This is great news for our economy and another step to creating thousands of good-paying jobs for Montanans.  
Baucus serves a dual role in the highway bill conference committee negotiations. Hes the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which controls highway financing. And Baucus is the key Democrat on the Senates highways subcommittee, which decides how the dollars are spent and where.  In addition to providing Montana with about $355 million per year, Baucus also secured earmarks for specific projects, transit dollars, and millions in research money for the state. Baucus also helped write the 1998-passed highway bill, which pumped more than $1.6 billion into Montanas economy. BAUCUS HIGHWAY BILL FOR MONTANA  
$50 million for the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park.  $30 million for the Kalispell bypass on Interstate 93.  $25 million for the reconstruction of Two Medicine Bridge, east of Glacier National Park $22 million for the Beartooth Highway, near Red Lodge, which was damaged by mudslides.  $20 million for safety improvements on U.S. Highway 2 between Browning and North Dakota. $17 million for improvements to Bench Boulevard in Billings.  
$15 million for improvements on U.S. Highway 93, from Lolo to Hamilton.  $15 million to improve Montana Highway 3 between Lavina and Great Falls.  $10 million for Shiloh Road near Billings.  $10 million for Highway 2 improvements east of Havre.  $10 million on U.S. Highway 2, from Glasgow east to the North Dakota line, to study the feasibility of a four-lane highway. $10 million for Interstate 15 improvements near Helena

Senior Senator Says Iraq War Must Not Escalate
January 10, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) â In a comprehensive speech on the Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Max Baucus made national news when he called on President Bush not to escalate the war in Iraq by sending more U.S. troops.     

Baucus said the U.S. should start bringing combat troops home from Iraq within six months and called on the White House to seek a diplomatic solution to the conflict.     

Baucusâ Iraq war speech, as prepared for delivery:     

Statement of Senator Max Baucus    

January 10, 2007    


Mr. President, I am concerned about the deteriorating situation in Iraq.  We need to change course.  Let me urge my Colleagues to consider a few principles for where we should go from here.    

Like my Colleagues, I have received an outpouring of letters, emails, and phone calls.  Montanans are split on how America should proceed.  But one thing is clear:  They all want to see an end to it.  They want to see our men and women come home.    


In October 20, a man from Cutbank, Montana, wrote me to say:    

âYesterday was a very emotional day for me . . . .  I currently have a son serving in Iraq who does house-to-house raids and goes out on extended missions.  My other son, who just joined the Army, informed me that he, too, will now be leaving for Iraq.  As Native Americans, my sons will be honored when they return home.  I am very proud of them, but I am deeply concerned with what they face every day over there . . . .â?    


Amber, a military wife from Great Falls, Montana, wrote:     

âI realize that my voice is a voice of millions that call for your assistance.  However, I couldn't sleep at night knowing I didn't at least try to do what I think is right.  My husband along with many others here in Montana is in Iraq right now and just recently lost a soldier from Billings. . . .  Help us bring the troops home where they belong, with their families who miss them.â?    

In September, Tom, a Marine Corps veteran and purple heart recipient from Missoula, Montana, wrote me to say:    

 âI no longer support the war in Iraq.  I believe that mismanagement of the occupation and reconstruction has made the war unwinnable and is distracting us from the war on terrorism.â?    

Mr. President, it is time for our combat troops to come home from Iraq.    

Mr. President, America entered into this war with motivations that were honorable.  But they were mistaken.    

As the 911 Commission found, there was no connection between Iraq and the attacks on 911.  There were no weapons of mass destruction.  And the theory that America could through invading Iraq establish democracy that would spread through the region has proven a cruel joke.    

If we knew then what we know now, I would not have voted for the war.  If we knew then what we know now, I believe that results of that vote would have been different.     


The administration was not up front with us.  They presented faulty intelligence and inaccurate information about weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, the quality of Congressâs decision-making was no better than the quality of the information upon which we relied.      

Going into Iraq was a mistake.  The premise was wrong.  After September 11, 2001, we had international support to go after Al- Qaeda and to find Osama Bin Laden.      

That is the mission we should be behind. Our resources are incorrectly being exhausted in Iraq. I cannot go back and change that vote.  But I can work on this new direction.    

I commend our troops.  They have shown exemplary strength.  They removed the tyrant Saddam Hussein.  They addressed the potential threat of weapons of mass destruction.  They have done their job well.  And their service has been outstanding.     

No one can argue against their contribution to our national security.  And their dedication to their missions goes unmatched.     


I believe in giving our soldiers, sailors, and airmen the proper equipment and the tools that they need to stay safe and to succeed.  A year ago, I spoke about our responsibility to get as much funding as possible to the troops.  I have criticized spending on high tech weapons systems at the expense of boots on the ground.  I voted in favor of every defense bill and war supplemental since the war began.      

I heard of families hosting bake sales to buy body armor.  I have tried to do everything that I could to protect our troops.  It is no longer enough.    


But now our brave troops now stand in the crossfire of a civil war.  We have lost more than 3,000 troops in the escalating Iraq conflict.  Just this week, the Iraqi health ministry reported that more than 17,000 Iraqis died in the second half of 2006.  That was more than three times as many as died in the first half of 2006.  And now America has spent more time fighting this war than we spent in World War II.    

I understand and sympathize with Americans who continue to support this war because they do not want their family and friends to have died in vain.  I know what they feel.  I struggled with that last summer when my nephew Phillip died in Iraq.    

On July 29th, Marine Corporal Phillip Baucus, my brother Johnâs son, was killed during combat operations in the Al Anbar province.  He was just 28 years old.      

Phillip was a bright and dedicated young man. He was like a son to me.  He had a loving wife and a bright future.  His death was devastating.    

I know what itâs like to wait on the flight line at Dover Air Force Base.  I know what itâs like to greet the body of a fallen soldier and family member.  I know what itâs like to pray for a reason, and to become determined not to lose.    

Iâm not the only Montanan who has grieved. 14 Montanans have lost their lives in Iraq.  We grieve for them all.    

Those men and women who have lost their lives have served a noble purpose.  They have taught us lessons in courage.      

We honor that courage by speaking up.  We honor that courage by admitting that what we are doing is not working.  And we honor that courage by finding a new direction.    


A change in strategy is not defeat.  A change in strategy is a recognition that things are not working.    

Moving forward, I urge the President and Congress to consider four principles:    

(1)     We must not escalate the conflict.    

(2)     We must train Iraqis to stand up for themselves.    

(3)     We must start bringing our troops home by the middle of the year.    

(4)        We must engage Iraqâs neighbors and the world community.    

Let me explain in greater detail.    

First, I do not support a surge in the number of American troops.  Throwing more troops at the problem is not a solution.  Escalating the war is not a solution.  We must not launch a strategy with that has no benchmarks for success.  How long and at what cost will we add troops to the conflict?  Itâs a mistake.    

The Iraq Study Group was a prestigious and well-respected group.  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was a member.  The study group said that the current strategy in Iraq is not working.  But to this date, the President has not implemented any of the groupâs recommendations.    

President Bush has stated numerous times that he listens to the commanders on the ground.  Well, American commanders on the ground report that Al Qaeda is increasingly gaining political influence among the Sunnis.  General Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee last November:  âI believe that more American forces prevent Iraqis from doing more, from taking responsibility for their own future.â?  I urge the President to listen to what General Abizaid said, and not just replace the commanders who say things that he does not want to hear.    


Second, we should not have an open-ended commitment in Iraq.  America must make that clear to the Iraqi government.  The war is now costing us $2 billion dollars a week.  That is $2 billion a week that is not being devoted to health care, veteran benefits, or education.      

There must be a more specific plan.  The plan needs to outline how long our training efforts will continue.  And the plan needs to show at what point the Iraqis will take over the security over their own country.     


Last weekend, Iraqâs Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, reiterated the need and his commitment to getting the Iraqi security forces to stand on their own two feet.  America should support these efforts.  In short, U.S. forces should stand down, so the Iraqi forces can stand up.    

Third, with a new focus on political solutions, the U.S. should start a phased redeployment of combat troops within 6 months, with the goal of having combat forces out of Iraq as soon as possible.      


Our troops are stretched too thin to address emerging threats around the world.  We must not focus solely on Iraq, with blinders to the rest of the world.  Our troops are serving their third and fourth tours in Iraq.  Some deployments have been extended from 12 to 18 months.  Some troops no longer have a year to spend at home between deployments.      

I have seen firsthand in Montana how the Guard and Reserves have deployed in record numbers. They have served honorably and with my great admiration.  But we need them on U.S. soil for homeland defense missions.    


And the active duty troops must not be overextended.  They need to be ready to deploy when necessary around the world.    

Finally, America must engage Iraqâs neighbors.  The Iraq Study Group named a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict as a major potential contributor to stability in Iraq.  The study group report states:      

âThe United States cannot achieve its goals in the Middle East unless it deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict and regional stability. There must be renewed and sustained commitment by the United States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts.â?      
 We have taken too many steps backward in that conflict.  Our invasion of Iraq has simply stirred things up.  Americaâs presence has opened the doors to terrorism and sectarian violence.      

We must reengage and work toward peace and diplomatic solutions.  We must seek increased participation of other nations both in a political way forward and in reconstruction work.  We should redouble our efforts to reach out to the U.N. and to our allies who also have an intense interest in peace in the region and work together toward a responsible exit.    

Mr. President, in March of 1919, the Emir of Iraq, Feisal ibn Husein, wrote to Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.  He wrote:    

âWe feel that the Arabs and Jews are cousins in race, having suffered similar oppressions at the hands of powers stronger than themselves, and by a happy coincidence have been able to take the first step toward the mutual attainment of their national ideals together. . . .  Indeed, I think that neither can be a real success without the other. . . .  I look forward . . . to a future in which we will help you and you will help us, so that the countries in which we are mutually interested may once again take their places in the community of civilized peoples of the world.â?    

Thatâs what the Emir of Iraq wrote, in 1919.    

            Mr. President, America must renew its commitment to peace in the Middle East.  We must work to regain the fleeting sense of optimism that can lead to political resolution.  And we must work to stop the spilling of blood in the land of Abraham.    


Mr. President, I urge President Bush to listen to the Iraq Study Group.  I urge him to listen to commanders like General Abizaid.  And I urge him to listen to the American people.      

It is time for America to change course.  It is time for a renewed political effort.  And it is time to bring the troops home.    

Mr. President, I yield the floor.

June 10, 2005
 (WASHINGTON, D.C.) -- As the state's senior U.S. Senator, Max Baucus has been asked to represent Montana before the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in Portland on June 17.    
""This is not only a real honor, but a huge opportunity for us as Montanans,"" said Baucus, in his fifth consecutive six-year term in the Senate. ""We're going to work together to present a united front to keep our flying mission in tact, and possibly pick up a new mission in the process.""    
The BRAC Commission, a panel of military experts appointed by President Bush and Congressional leaders, is considering a Pentagon recommendation to realign -- or move -- the F-16 flying mission now housed at the Montana Air National Guard in Great Falls.    
Since those recommendations were published May 13, Baucus, the state's Congressional delegation, Governor, Great Falls Mayor, and community leaders have been lobbying in earnest to keep the mission and land an alternate assignment.    
Baucus will be allotted just 30 minutes to represent the state before the Commission in Portland. He announced today he will share his time with Senator Conrad Burns and Adjutant Gen. Randall Mosley, the head of Montana's National Guard units.    
Baucus is also soliciting input from the members of his own BRAC advisory panel of retired officers, which he's met with weekly via conference call since March. The Governor, Great Falls mayor, and other community leaders are also being asked to contribute to the effort, Baucus said.    
""These very well could be the most important 30 minutes we'll get in this process,"" Baucus said in a letter sent today to several key figures in Great Falls. ""During this process, the input and support that you have provided me has been invaluable as we work to find a solution for Montana's Air Guard. This is a team effort. The best way we can serve the people of Montana is by working together and I would appreciate any further information and assistance from you which will help my testimony before the BRAC Commission.""    
The BRAC Commission is holding regional hearings to gather input on the recommendations. The meeting in Portland will give representatives from Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho a chance to plead their states' case. More than 15 of these hearings will be held across the country, in places such as Boston, Salt Lake City, and North and South Dakota.    
Baucus' advisory panel includes (all retired) General Gene Prendergast, General Gary Hindoien, General Doug Henneman, Colonel Pat Pauli, Colonel George Donnelly, and Colonel Ken Van Sickle.

May 10, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â At a press conference today on Capitol Hill, Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus urged Congress to pass a bill that would empower the National Guard within the Pentagon.    

Baucus, a co-sponsor of the National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act of 2006, said that itâs time for National Guard members to have an equal voice at the Department of Defense. The bill would enable the Guard to have a seat at the table with the other Joint Chiefs of Staff and make decisions regarding its troops and budget.    

The National Guard Empowerment Act has support from both Republicans and Democrats, Baucus said and noted that an identical piece of legislation is being considered by the House.    

âOur brave Montana Guardswomen and men play a vital role in our state and in our nationâs military operations,â? Baucus said. âItâs high time they get the treatment and respect they deserve. This legislation would empower our Montana Guardsmen because they are the ones who know best how to use their resources â such as where to deploy their troops and how to spend their budget.â?    

Baucus was joined today at the press conference by Montanaâs Adjutant General Randy Mosley who is based in Helena.    

âIt was wonderful having Senator Baucus here today demonstrating to not only the nationâs adjutant generals but also the nationâs citizens that he is a strong supporter of the National Guard and the nationâs defense both home and abroad,â? said Gen. Mosley.    

Baucus said that the Guard plays a critical role in Americaâs defense at home and abroad and noted there are many obstacles that prevent the force from reaching its full potential. Earlier this year the Army proposed significant cuts to Guard troop strength. Also, last year during the Base Realignment and Closure Commission process the Air Guard was on the chopping block and neither the Adjutant Generals nor the Governors were consulted about their fate.    

The National Guard has a long history of assisting America's military abroad while providing support and security at home. Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the National Guard has taken on even greater responsibilities in the realm of homeland security. Also, the Guard has been a tremendous value for the capabilities it provides as one of the nationâs primary military reserves, providing 40 percent of the total military force for around 4.5 percent of the defense budget, Baucus said.     

âFrankly our Guards men deserve to be treated better,â? Baucus said. âThey are true patriots and they have my support 110 percent. Iâm committed to working together with my colleagues in the Senate and House to get this legislation passed.â?    

The National Guard Association, the Adjutants General Association, and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard have endorsed the bill, which is sponsored by Sens. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont).

Senator Tells Energy Chiefs To Expect Fight; Wants Public Meetings in Kalispell
September 10, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  The British Petroleum Company can expect a knock-down, drag-out fight if it advances a proposal to tap coalbed methane seems in the Canadian Flathead, Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus said today.  Baucus issued the warning during a face-to-face meeting in his Washington, D.C., office with BP America Chairman and President Bob Malone and BP Canada chief Randy McLeod.  Baucus said BP can expect a massive and unpleasant fight from Montana that will end badly for the company should it file an exploratory permit for its Mist Mountain coalbed methane extraction project in British Columbia -- near North Fork of the Flathead River, which borders Glacier National Park and runs into Montanas Flathead Lake.  Baucus, who successfully blocked a coal mining project in the same area in 1988, says coalbed methane development there could have devastating consequences to fish, wildlife, and the recreation industry downstream in Montana.  Ive been fighting to protect water quality and wildlife in the Flathead Valley for 30 years, Baucus said after the meeting. Im not about to give up now. Were going to do whatever it takes to stop energy development north of our border. Were pulling out all the stops. The gloves are off.  Baucus also asked the company to conduct public meetings in Kalispell as soon as possible to allow Montanans to weigh in on the proposal.  The most significant byproduct of coalbed methane extraction is wastewater that can contain high levels of harmful contaminants such as barium, copper, iron, and ammonium. Canada has no law requiring that coalbed methane wastewater be re-injected back into the ground. Even so, the Flathead Lake Biological Station in Montana says that re-injection would be technically impossible given the hydrology and rugged terrain in the region.  BP is expected to file for an exploratory permit to dig test wells in whats called the Crowsnest Coal Field, an area that spans 190 square miles, covering much of the B.C. portions of the North Fork of the Flathead as well as the adjacent Elk River Valley, which drains into Lake Koocanusa near Libby.  At the same time hes fighting the BP proposal, Baucus is also working to stop a separate coal mining project proposed by the Cline Mining Co., in the same area.  Some places should be off limits, Baucus said. Its that simple. Some places are too important to hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation.  Baucus is also making good on his promise to secure dollars to gauge the environmental threats posed by energy development in the Canadian Flathead. Hes working with Sen. Jon Tester to shepherd $1.25 million through Congress to collect baseline environmental data in the area.  -30-

April 11, 2007
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) -- At a press conference on Capitol Hill today, U.S. Senators Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) introduced legislation to help protect children from online pornography by enabling parents, schools, libraries, and others to set Internet browsers to prevent children from viewing Web sites that contain adult material.     
The senators' bill - the Cyber Safety For Kids Act - would require adult Web site operators to include a flag in their Web site which would make it easier for filtering software to block adult material. In addition, the legislation would require Web sites with adult material to have a clean homepage and to have visitors verify their age when they sign onto the Web site.     
""Bottom line, we want to keep our kids safe when they're on the Internet,"" Baucus said. ""Parents and teachers shouldn't worry about their kids when they're on the computer at home or in the classroom. This bill will help keep kids safe and give parents peace of mind.""    
If enacted, the Cyber Safety for Kids Act would require the Department of Commerce within 90 days of being signed into law to:    
â¢	Develop an electronic tag for Web sites with sexually explicit adult material and would require those Web sites to use electronic tags when registering or renewing registration. Parents, teachers, librarians, etc. would then be able to set their Internet browsers on their computers to block Web sites with adult material electronic tags.  â¢	Make it mandatory for Web sites with adult material to have a clean homepage.  â¢	Require Web sites with adult material to have visitors verify that they're 18 years of age or older.  â¢	The Department of Commerce would issue civil penalties to Web sites with adult material if they fail to follow the guidelines outlined in the Cyber Safety For Kids Act and enforced by the Department of Commerce.    
Baucus said that the legislation has support from parents, teachers and others who want to protect children from adult material on the Internet.    
The legislation will go to the Senate Commerce Committee before going to the full Senate for its consideration, Baucus said.

July 11, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â In a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation Council of Presidents today, Montana Senator Max Baucus told Americaâs top trade negotiator that no agreement before the World Trade Organization is better than a bad deal for Montana farmers and ranchers.  

Using his post as the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade, Baucus has been leading the fight for fair trade agreements for Montanaâs farmers and ranchers. He was joined at the speech by U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, who heâs been working closely with on the ongoing Doha Round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization.  Trade ministers from around the world met in Geneva, Switzerland at the end of June to try to hammer out an agreement.  

âI stressed that Ambassador Schwab needed to bring home a good deal, one that resulted in real new markets for Montana farmers and ranchers,â? Baucus said. âAnd I made it clear that I would not support a deal that was bad for U.S. agriculture.â?     

Schwab backed away from the negotiating table after other countries refused to make concessions that would level the playing field for American agriculture in the global marketplace.   

âIâm glad she did,â? Baucus said, âbecause no deal is better than a bad deal for Montana farmers and ranchers.â?   

Baucus also talked about his role on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes as well, and his fight to fully repeal the estate tax in order to protect Montana farmers and ranchers. Though a vote on full repeal recently failed to pass the Senate, Baucus is currently working on a compromise that would exempt more than 99 percent of Montana farmers and ranchers.  

âI feel strongly that any compromise should include special provisions aimed at specifically helping farmers and ranchers pass their land down to the next generation,â? stated Baucus.  

In addition to his position on the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus is the only member of Montanaâs congressional delegation to sit on the Agriculture committee, which will write a new Farm Bill in 2007. Baucus has committed to fighting for programs that will allow Montana producers to continue to produce high quality food, and maintain Montanaâs agricultural heritage.

Senator Introduces Measure To Ensure Agencies Have Resources To Battle Wildfires

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
July 11, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today introduced a bill that would set up a new trust fund that would provide a steady and reliable stream of revenue the Forest Service and other agencies would use to battle wildfires without borrowing from other programs.   Baucus said the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management frequently borrow emergency fire suppression funds from themselves through program money allocated by Congress. This cycle of taking funds from other important programs, such as hazardous fuel reduction projects, to fund firefighting activity undermines both agencies and leaves priority programs unfunded, Baucus said.   Were staring down the barrel at another dangerous fire season in Montana and much of the West, Baucus said. And every year we have to go back to Congress and ask for emergency dollars. Its a never ending cycle of taking money from some programs to pay for fighting our wildfires. It makes no sense  we shouldnt have to rob Peter to pay Paul.  The Baucus bill, the Stable Fire Funding Act of 2007, would authorize $600 million in seed money to create a trust fund for the Forest Service in fiscal year 2008, as well as $200 million in seed money for a BLM trust fund. That seed money will generate interest, which would be used to cover 80 percent of firefighting costs that go over the agencies budgets provided by Congress for that given year.   This bill is a stop-gap measure that will kick-in to cover firefighting costs in bad fire years, Baucus said. Some years the fund wont need to be tapped, other years it will. The point, though, is to make sure other important programs arent hurt in the process. This bill will provide a steady, long-term funding mechanism to deal with catastrophic wildfire while protecting other important programs under the Forest Service and BLM.   With record temperatures already this summer were on track for another destructive and expensive fire season, Baucus said. Last month Baucus toured the Madison Arm Fire near West Yellowstone. Officials told Baucus that agencies can spend up to $1 million per day fighting blazes.  I want to do all I can to ensure that the fire fighting dollars are there when Montana needs them, Baucus said.  Maxs bill is an innovative idea that will keep red tape and Washington wrangling to a minimum while making sure our wildland firefighters get the resources they need to keep Montana safe, said Montana Senator Jon Tester. This is smart, sustainable, and it will streamline the funding process.  -30-

May 11, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â At a meeting on Capitol Hill today, Montana Senator Max Baucus urged CEOs from the nationâs top pharmaceutical companies to continue programs that provide free or discounted prescription drugs to seniors who could not otherwise afford them.   

At issue are so-called âpatient assistance programsâ? run by pharmaceutical companies that provide free or discounted drugs to people who do not have or are not eligible for drug coverage. As the new Medicare Part D prescription drug plan goes into effect, several companies have said they may drop the low-income drug programs that, in some cases, have existed for more than 50 years.   

Baucus wants the companies to continue the assistance programs in addition to the new Medicare Part D benefit.   

âThese prescription drug programs are vital to people who canât afford their medicine â with or without the new Medicare Part D program,â? Baucus said after the meeting. âThe Medicare drug benefit will help millions of people get their drugs, but the pharmaceutical company programs are every bit as important.â?   

Typically, the private drug assistance programs help people who fall below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, Baucus said.    

âWeâre talking about people who really need help with their medications,â? said Baucus, the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly.   

Some pharmaceutical companies have raised legal concerns about whether or not they can offer the discounted programs alongside the Medicare Part D program. But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently ruled that the companies can indeed continue the programs.

September 11, 2007
Washington, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Finance Committee, today unveiled a plan to provide billions of dollars in tax relief and disaster assistance to Montanas farmers and ranchers.  Baucus tax package -- proposed to be included in the new Farm Bill -- would provide incentives for conservation, alternative energy production, and create a permanent disaster relief fund.   Agriculture is the backbone of our state, and Im going to doing everything I can to help ease the burden on our farmers and ranchers backs, said Baucus, who is also a senior member of Senate Agriculture Committee. Whether its a few more dollars in their pocket, or knowing that one disaster wont force them to sell the family farm, this package is good for our producers, our state, and our country.  Baucus used his position as Finance Committee Chairman to develop the package, which will free up between $8 billion to $10 billion in revenue that can be used in the Farm Bill, which is set to expire on Sept. 30.   In a statement released Tuesday, Agriculture Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said I welcome todays comments from Chairman Baucus. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, as well as Chairman of the Finance Committee, he understands our difficult budget situation and the critical need for the resources that will allow us to craft a successful new farm bill.   Montanas junior U.S. Senator Jon Tester, a farmer from Big Sandy, said Baucus plan will provide a shot in the arm for producers on the ground.  As a farmer, I know firsthand how important the Farm Bill is for Montana producers, said Tester, a third generation farmer. Farmers and ranchers around Montana have been struggling every year with draught making it harder and harder to stay on the farm. With Maxs tax package, permanent disaster relief will finally provide the safety net that our producers deserve and Ill be with him every step of the way to see it come to fruition.  Baucus package would provide the following benefits:   Conservation Tax Credit: While producers now receive cash payments for land conservation efforts, Baucus plan would provide producers with the option of receiving a tax credit in lieu of the cash. By providing tax incentives, Baucus would free up funds from the Farm Bill budget.   Permanent Agriculture Disaster Relief: Instead of infrequent disaster assistance bills, Baucus proposal would establish a permanent disaster relief trust fund to financial assistance to farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters.   Alternative Energy Tax Incentives: Baucus package will also include a variety of tax incentives for wind, and as well as other alternative energy production to encourage farmers to grow crops used for ethanol, biodiesel, and cellulosic biofuels.   Rural Development Bond: This proposal will create a new category of tax credit bonds for projects such as rural electric and telemedicine, rural broadband and other economic development projects.  Final details of Baucus agriculture tax package will be released in the coming weeks when it will goes before the Finance Committee for consideration.   -30-

Convicted Felon Testifies At Finance Committee Hearing On IRS Loopholes
April 12, 2007
(Washington D.C.) - With the tax filing deadline rapidly approaching, Montana's senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today held a hearing in his committee on ways to crack down on financial scams. The key witness at the hearing was a convicted felon who is serving time for identity theft and tax fraud.    
Baucus, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, was featured this morning in an NBC Today Show report about identity thieves who use personal information to file fraudulent tax returns. ""The IRS is not anywhere close to doing what it could and should do. . . in protecting American taxpayers from fraud,""   Baucus said in the nationally televised report. (To watch the NBC Today Show report, click  here .)    
Baucus said that one of his top priorities as chairman is to make sure that taxpayer information is kept safe and secure and that the Internal Revenue Service effectively deters and detects tax filing abuses - by identity thieves, and also by unscrupulous tax preparers who have IRS authorization to file returns for others.     
""Obviously, the IRS can't visit each paid preparer,"" said Baucus at today's hearing. ""That is why it is important for the IRS to have a robust, up-front process so it knows the caliber of those who are authorized to file tax returns, both on paper and electronically.  That's why the IRS must clamp down on the use of stolen identities to file fraudulent tax returns.""    
Baucus requested  Evangelos Dimitrios Soukas, a man serving time for identity theft and tax fraud , to participate in today's hearing.  Soukas testified how easy it was to use other people's tax information to file false taxes and receive their refund money.    
""To hijack the personal information of someone is not hard at all,"" Soukas said today. ""In my eyes, it doesn't take an Einstein to file false tax claims.  It is actually pretty easy. If I really wanted to continue in this field I could have safeguarded my true identity and never been caught. What I don't understand is, why doesn't the IRS have some type of security measure by issuing out a pin number or even using a mother's maiden name when filing electronically or even calling in the call center?  There should be some type of extra measure to safe guard the people's tax records, in my opinion.""    
IRS Commissioner Mark Everson also testified at Baucus' hearing. Everson talked about the IRS's efforts to oversee preparers and filing season processes and how the IRS plans to ensure that the tax system does not fall prey to tax cheats.     
""I urge the IRS to work harder and crack down on identity theft and false tax report filings,"" Baucus said. ""It's inexcusable that our tax system is abused so easily. I'm committed to working together with the IRS to protect Montanans' and Americans' identities.""    
Baucus said the Finance Committee has previously passed legislation to regulate paid preparers of tax returns, and that he intends to bring that bill up again this year. He noted that he'll continue to look at additional measures to protect taxpayers from fraud.

December 12, 2005
(Washington, D.C.) âDespite efforts to change a controversial mining provision that would affect public lands in Montana and much of the West, U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said today he still opposes the provision sponsored by Reps. Gibbons of New Mexico and Pombo of California.    
Upon learning of the proposed changes, Baucus released the following statement:    
""It's still a bad idea and I'm still opposed to it. Changes such as these â which affect our ability to access public lands â should be debated in the light of day, not in some backroom of the Capitol. We need an honest and open debate over how are public lands are managed. This process is anything but open. It's in bad need of some sunshine.""

December 12, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana's senior Senator Max Baucus today praised Japan for lifting its ban on U.S. beef from cattle 20 months and younger, but cautioned that there's still a lot of work to be done to get the Asian country to open its borders to all U.S. beef.    
Japan closed its borders to U.S. beef following a bovine spongiform encephalopathy case that was discovered in Washington state in December 2003. Baucus said that the U.S. has always met international beef standards and noted Montana produces the highest-quality beef in the world.    
""I'm pleased that Japan has taken first steps to lifting its ban on U.S. beef,"" Baucus said. ""Today's announcement that Japan will take U.S. beef from cattle 20 months of age and younger is a good first step, but it is just that â a first step. There is still a lot of work to be done. The U.S. â particularly Montana beef â is the highest quality, safest beef in the world. I'm committed to continue working together with the Japanese so they will fully lift their ban and take all of our world-class beef.""    
Baucus is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee as well as the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade.    
In March 2004, Baucus traveled to Japan and met with top Japanese officials about reopening borders to U.S. beef. Later that same year leaders from both countries signed an agreement for Japan to resume trade, however Japan has not lived up to its end of the deal and the American beef market is feeling the effects, Baucus said, noting 30 percent of U.S. beef exports went to Japan before it closed its borders.

Senator's Rocky Mtn. Front Drilling Ban Headed To Bush
December 12, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â The Rocky Mountain Front will be protected from new oil and gas drilling permits forever, thanks to legislation passed by Montana Senator Max Baucus.     
""This is a major, major victory for Montana. We've been working to pass meaningful protections for the Rocky Mountain Front for 30 years,"" said Baucus, who often hikes up Ear Mountain in the Front. ""Thirty years from now, our kids and grandchildren will thank us. An awful lot of people worked on this and I want to thank each and every one of them.""       Baucus, as the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, was a lead negotiator on legislation to extend expiring tax credits. The bill was the last piece of legislation this Congress will pass, and therefore the last opportunity to pass meaningful protections for the Front.      
âIt wasnât easy,â? Baucus said. âBut we finally got it done.â?     
Baucus used his seat at the table to include language that will make permanent a 1997 moratorium on new oil and gas leases on the Front and make it easier to retire existing leases. The bill passed the Senate late Friday and is now headed to President Bush for his expected signature.     
""The Front is a crowning jewel for Montana and the country,"" Baucus said. ""Some places should be off limits, and the Front is one of them. The Rocky Mountain Front will be protected forever. Our children's children will be able to hunt, fish, hike and camp there â just like we do today. I'm extremely proud.""     
The outright ban on new leases will also allow a coalition of non-profit groups to purchase existing leases from oil and gas companies and retire them without fear that the federal government would turn around and reissue the leases in the future.     
Baucus' provision also includes an incentive for lease-holding energy companies to sell their leases.  The provision provides a tax holiday â equal to 25 percent of the capital gain received by the seller â for sales of leases to non profit groups that agree to retire the leases.  This provision applies to 60 current leases on the Front.     
A coalition of sportsmen and women, conservationists, ranchers, and elected officials has been working to retire leases on the Front. Baucus thanked the many groups who pushed for the drilling ban, including The Wilderness Society, the Montana Wilderness Association, Montana Trout Unlimited, the Montana Wildlife Federation, Friends of the Rocky Mountain Front, the Coalition to Protect the Rocky Mountain Front, and the Blackfeet Nation.     
âThis was a team effort,â? Baucus said. âWe all can be very proud of working together.â?   The Front contains little in the way of proven oil and gas reserves, but is rich in wildlife habitat â including grizzly, elk, and bighorn sheep -- and is home to world-class hunting, fishing, and recreation opportunities, Baucus said.     
The area is also considered sacred by the Blackfeet Indian Tribe.     
In 1997, Lewis and Clark Forest Supervisor Gloria Flora withdrew 365,000 acres of federal land in the Front from new oil and gas leasing activities -- based in large part upon overwhelming public support for protecting the Front.   But in many parts of the Front, oil and gas leases exist that pre-date the 1997 decision.    -30-

Baucus, Tester, Rehberg Meet With Secretary Johanns On FSA Closures, Funding Ag Programs
February 12, 2007
(Washington, DC) - Montana's Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester and Congressman Denny Rehberg today met with Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and urged him to reject a proposal to close FSA offices because they provide vital services to Montana's ranchers and farmers.    

The USDA is considering closing seven FSA offices in Montana, citing that it will be more efficient to consolidate office locations. The delegation said FSA offices provide important services for producers such as emergency assistance payments and sign-ups for all farm programs. The three men today urged Secretary Johanns to reject any proposals that would close FSA offices in Montana.    

The delegation also encouraged Secretary Johanns to fully fund vital agriculture research programs that are could receive funding cuts this year. Since Congress has decided not to have earmarks - funding for specific projects -- this year Baucus, Tester and Rehberg urged Secretary Johanns to ensure that USDA provides funding for agriculture programs that are important to Montana. The delegation stated that investing in research is vital to Montana's agricultural future.    

""Montanans should not have to travel farther or clear additional hurdles to access farm programs - it's common sense to keep the FSA offices open,"" Baucus said. ""Agriculture is the backbone of our state's economy and we should be investing in it. I'm committed to working together with Jon and Denny to ensure that Montana's agriculture industry has a bright and successful tomorrow.""    

""I'm glad I had the opportunity to speak with Secretary Johanns this afternoon and express to him my great concern with the current proposal to shut down seven FSA offices in Montana.  Family farms and ranches face ever increasing odds and closing these offices will mean greater distances to travel for fewer services.  As a third generation farmer I know first hand how important FSA offices are to Montana's producers and I will fight in Washington to protect their existence,"" said Tester.    

""In Montana, we like to do things face-to-face,"" said Rehberg, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.  ""This is why Montana's FSA offices are so important.  So, taking a page from our own playbook, both Senators and I decided the best way to get our point across was a sit down meeting with Secretary Johanns. Closing these FSA offices is unacceptable and I hope the Secretary now understands that.""    

Since the proposed FSA closures came to light, Baucus, Tester and Rehberg have worked together to put a halt to the proposal. The delegation earlier this month sent a letter to Secretary Johanns urging the USDA to not approve the proposal. The delegation also urged Secretary Johanns to consult with Montana producers before making any decisions about FSA office closures -- since producers are the ones with ""their boots on the ground"" and know what's best for Montana.    

Baucus, Tester and Rehberg said they are committed to working together to ensure that Montana's agriculture industry and producers don't get the short end of the stick.

Senator Helped Secure Funds For Public Access In Elkhorns
July 12, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus today applauded the completion of the Iron Mask Ranch purchase, which will open up more than 5,500 acres of private land northwest of Townsend to public access for hunting and recreation.  Baucus has been a stalwart advocate for the land deal, which was completed today as 2,472 acres of privately held land were transferred to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.  Baucus helped secure vital federal funding for the land purchase through Department of Interior spending bills in Congress ($1 million in fiscal year 2005 and $1.25 million in fiscal year 2007.) He also set up the Montana Fish and Wildlife Trust, which was funded from the sale of cabins at Canyon Ferry Reservoir. The Trust kicked in a total of $540,000 for the purchase.  This is a prime example of Montanans working together to protect and enhance our vast open spaces and world class hunting and recreation opportunities, Baucus said. I was proud to be a partner in this effort and Im proud to see this public access dream realized.  Because the property abuts U.S. Forest Service, BLM, and state lands, the transfer will open up thousands of new acres for Montana recreation and public access  forever.  Baucus applauded the team effort. He said federal and state agencies, and groups like The Conservation Fund and the Rocky Mtn. Elk Foundation played a pivotal role in the projects successful outcome.  With millions of acres of ranchland across the West at risk for development, it is critical that we work to protect our most significant landscapes, said The Conservation Funds Montana state director, Gates Watson. The Elkhorn Range contains some of the most important and vulnerable wildlife habitat in Montana. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Baucus and the Montana Congressional Delegation, the commitment of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and the support of the local community, we have permanently conserved some of the states vital natural resources and enhanced public recreation opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts.  -30-

Senator's Measure Will Strengthen Provisions To Help Put Cash In Troops' Pockets
June 12, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today introduced legislation that would provide tax relief for military men and women and their families.  Baucus Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act helps members of the military by providing tax relief for combat pay, retirement savings, or purchasing homes. Baucus bill also includes tax incentives for employers of military reservists and for members of the National Guard who provide assistance to employees who are called to active duty.   Baucus is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which is the panel that has jurisdiction over all taxes and revenue.  Our brave military personnel lay their lives on the line every day to protect the freedoms we enjoy as Montanans and Americans  they shouldnt have to fight the tax code too when they return home, Baucus said. This legislation would provide much needed tax relief for our military men and women. Im committed to working together with my colleagues to get it passed quickly.  Baucus Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act Would:  Make permanent a provision that allows soldiers to count their non-taxable combat pay when figuring their eligibility for the earned income tax credit, a refundable federal income tax credit that puts cash in the hands of working individuals and families.  Qualified mortgage bonds are available to all veterans to purchase their homes.   Cut taxes for small businesses when they continue paying members of the National Guard and Reserve who are called to duty.  Eliminates red tape for reporting of income when companies continue paying members of the National Guard and Reserve who are called to duty. This makes it easier for reservists to file their taxes and simpler for employers to keep contributing to those employees retirement plans.   Allow the families of soldiers killed in the line of duty to contribute up to 100 percent of survivor benefits to a retirement savings account.   Allow active duty troops to withdraw money from retirement plans and give them two years to replace the funds without tax penalty.   Extend a provision that gives retired veterans more time to claim a tax refund on some types of disability benefit payments.  Make permanent a provision that gives intelligence service employees a longer period of time to meet residency requirements necessary to exclude profits from the sale of their home from capital gains tax, which is often necessary due to frequent deployment.   Give the IRS the authority to treat gifts of thanks from states to veteranssuch as payments of excess state revenueas nontaxable gifts.  Baucus said the Finance Committee is expected to consider the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act this month.  -30-

Senator Wants MT Producers To Tap Growing Market
June 12, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  U.S. Senator Max Baucus wants to include language in the new Farm Bill to help Montana agriculture producers sell products to Cuba.   In a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Baucus, who is a senior member of the panel writing the new farm program, said a bureaucratic ruling from 2005 is preventing certain types of agricultural sales to the island nation.   Prior to 2005, U.S. exporters routinely shipped Montana products to Cuba, transferring title and physical control to the Cuban buyers only after they got paid in full. However, a 2005 Treasury Department ruling now requires Cuba to pay cash before U.S. agriculture products leave the U.S. port.   At the time, Baucus predicted the rule would put a chill on ag trade with Cuba, as agricultural goods paid for by Cuba while still in the U.S. port could be subject to seizure to satisfy private claims against the Cuban government.   Agricultural sales to Cuba have dropped for two consecutive years, wrote Baucus, who has been leading the charge to increase sales to Cuba since the 2005 ruling. Congress expressly intended to allow for cash-basis agricultural sales to Cuba, and yet, since the rule took effect, I am unaware of any more such sales transacted on a cash-basis.  Baucus said that including language in the 2007 farm bill to overturn the Treasury Department rule, and to eliminate foreign banks from the transactions, would make it easier to sell more agricultural goods to Cuba. Baucus indicated that he is currently working on legislation to address these and other restrictions on agricultural trade and travel to Cuba.  Following passage of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act (TSREEA) of 2000, annual U.S. food sales to Cuba reached close to $400 million, placing that nation among the leading 27 export markets for U.S. agricultural products, wrote Baucus, who is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade.   In September 2003, Baucus secured a first-ever Montana agriculture deal with Cuba that ultimately topped out at $10.4 million worth of Montana wheat, dry beans and peas sales to the island. Baucus returned to Cuba in December 2004 to negotiate a second deal for $15 million.  -30-

Senator Working To Help Those Affected By Drought, Flood
September 12, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) ââ At a press conference on Capitol Hill today, Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus and others today called on Congress to pass an emergency disaster assistance package that will help agriculture producers recover from extended drought and wildfire in Montana.      

Baucus, a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was joined by other farm-state senators as well as members from national farm organizations.    

âOur producers have suffered long enough â itâs high time for Congress to pass agriculture disaster assistance legislation now,â? Baucus said. âMontana producers have suffered more than enough from consecutive years of drought and now they have to deal with losses due to wildfires as well. They need our help and they deserve it now.â?    

Last week, Baucus, a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, helped introduce legislation to provide assistance for agricultural producers who have suffered crop or livestock losses due to natural disasters during 2005 and 2006.     

The new bill also incorporates provisions from legislation Baucus previously introduced that will help livestock producers recover from losses due to wildfires, including a payment for each animal lost to this yearâs fires.     

More than 20 national farm organizations, including the National Farmers Union and the American Farm Bureau Federation, have written Congress to endorse disaster legislation.    

Jon Stoner, President of the Montana Grain Growers Association, attended the press conference calling for agricultural disaster assistance.     

""We appreciate all of the work and strong support Senator Baucus gives to Montana agricultural producers,"" said Jon Stoner, President of the Montana Grain Growers Association.  ""After suffering multiple years of drought and ever increasing input costs, this agricultural disaster assistance legislation is very much needed by Montana producers.""    

The bill would provide emergency funding to farmers and ranchers who have suffered weather-related crop production shortfalls, quality losses and damage to livestock feed supplies. It will also provide direct payments for livestock losses, has a special provision for sugar beat producers, and includes aid for replacing ewe lambs.      

The bill will also help farmers overcome losses as a result of energy prices that spiked following last yearâs hurricanes. Energy-related farm expenses rose by more than $1.2 billion last year compared to 2004; unlike other industries, farmers and ranchers are largely unable to pass on these costs, meaning those higher energy costs continue to squeeze an already tight bottom line.       

âAgriculture is not only the backbone of Montana but of our country as well,â? Baucus said. âWhen a community or an industry is impacted by a natural disaster such as a hurricane or tornado, we extend a helping hand.  Agriculture should not be any different.  We must all work together to ensure that our agriculture products remain the best and highest quality in the world.â?    

Baucus is the only member of the Montana delegation to have a seat on the Agriculture Committee.

April 13, 2007
(Washington D.C.) -- A mysterious disorder is destroying the nation's bee population, which is important to agriculture producers. That's why 35 Senators joined Montana Senator Max Baucus, who spearheaded a letter today to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns demanding to know what actions are being taken to stop it.     
The disorder, known as Bee Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD, has affected bees in more than 27 states. Adult bees leave their hive and do not return, presumably dying. The origins or cause of the disease is unknown.    
""CCD is causing terrible losses for beekeepers all over the country. It's a very real threat to honey production here in Montana and to many U.S. crops that need bee pollination,"" said Steve Park, Past President of the American Honey Producers Association  ""We urgently need the USDA's help in understanding and stopping CCD.  Senator Baucus has been a strong supporter of Montana's honey producers for many years and we really appreciate his leadership in fighting CCD.""    
""America's beekeepers and their bees are an indispensable pillar of U.S. agriculture,"" Baucus and the senators wrote. ""Our nation's beekeepers provide essential pollination services for over 90 different food, seed, and fiber crops.""    
Baucus, a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and the senators said it's imperative for the USDA to act immediately to find the cause, and cure for Colony Collapse Disorder.    
""We are writing on an urgent basis to ask that you provide us with an expedited report on the immediate steps that the Depart is and will be taking to determining the causes of CCD, and to develop appropriate countermeasures for this serious disorder,"" the senators said.    
Baucus said that not only will honey production be affected, but all crops that rely on bees for pollination purposes including almonds, soybeans, apples, and blueberries will be destroyed, costing millions of dollars.               
Senator Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), also a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, agreed saying ""The significant loss of our bee colonies is having a serious impact on an important sector of our nation's agricultural economy.""     
Montana is one of the top six honey producing states.

December 13, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) today threatened to pull his support from asbestos reform legislation if provisions protecting people in Libby, Mont. are removed. 
Baucus fought for months to include his Libby Fix in the Senate-passed Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act, which aims to reform how asbestos lawsuits are handled across the country.  Baucus, hearing that asbestos bill opponents have attacked the Libby provisions, took to the Senate floor today and threatened to tank the entire bill if people in Libby dont get the compensation they need and deserve.  Baucus is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. The committee is expected to consider a necessary tax title to accompany the asbestos bill early in 2006. Baucus said today he will do whatever it takes to help protect Libby, including using his influence to hold up the bill in the Finance Committee.  The Senators fix would take into account the unique circumstances surrounding Libby, a small northwest Montana town whose residents were exposed to asbestos fibers by the W.R. Grace Co., which operated a vermiculite mine there until 1990. It would, among other things, provide Libby residents who are sick with at least $400,000 in compensation.  
Hundreds of people have died and even more are sick because of exposure to tremolite asbestos  a unique kind of asbestos found in Libby that creates different health problems than the more common asbestos fibers found in other parts of the country.  Ill yank my support from the asbestos bill in a New York minute if the Libby Fix gets pulled, said Baucus. Ill not only pull my support for the bill, but Ill actively fight to sink it altogether. Baucus Libby Fix includes:  
Libby claimants are exempted from the exposure criteria in the bill  they have to establish that they lived, worked or played within a 20-mile radius of Libby for any 12-month period prior to December 31, 2004;  Libby claimants are exempted from the bills medical criteria; the bill establishes special medical criteria applicable only to Libby claimants. Libby claimants also can choose to have their claims referred to an expert Physicians Panel which will utilize the special medical criteria developed for Libby resident to ensure they are treated fairly.  If the Libby claimants comply with the Libby-specific medical criteria, they will receive a Level 4 award, or $400,000, essentially establishing a floor of compensation of $400,000 for sick Libby claimants 
 Baucus visited Libby in March for the 16th time since 1999. Libby residents told the senator they didnt want him to support an asbestos bill that doesnt include adequate compensation.

Senator: Bush Administration Padlock Proposal 'Dead in the Water'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
February 13, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Saying he doesn't support putting a padlock on Montana's hunting, fishing, and recreation lands, Montana Senator Max Baucus today came out swinging against a Bush Administration proposal to sell off more than 300,000 acres of public lands.    
""This plan is dead in the water as long as I'm in the U.S. Senate,"" Baucus said. ""Our public lands shouldn't be sold off the highest bidder. We should be looking at ways to boost access to hunting and fishing lands, not at ways to put more padlocks on more gates.""    
Baucus is taking issue with a proposal outlined in President Bush's fiscal year 2007 budget proposal to Congress that would sell off more than 14,000 acres of public land in Montana to pay for the Secure Rural Schools Act, which provides payments to counties for timber-related sales.    
Baucus supports extending the program, which he helped establish in 2000, but not by selling off public lands to do so.    
Baucus sponsored an amendment to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 that let counties choose between a steady payment and receiving 25 percent of its timber receipts, which have declined in recent years.  At the time, Baucus said Montana would get at least $7 million more per year under the program. In 1999, Montana counties received $6.18 million in funding from revenues derived from timber sales on the national forest lands. The new program brought more than $14.3 million to Montana in fiscal year 2006.    
""Under this new plan, Montana counties get more money, more certainty, and more flexibility.  I'd call that a pretty good solution,"" Baucus said on October 30, 2000, when then-President Clinton signed the bill into law.    
The 2000-enacted Rural Schools program is set to expire or ""sunset"" this year. Baucus has co-sponsored legislation to fund the program for seven more years without selling public lands.    
Last year the program received $403 million nationally. The Bush Administration's plan would slash that funding to about $800 million over the next five-year period.    
""The merits of the Secure Rural Schools program are not in question,"" said Baucus, Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator. ""The proposal to sell off public lands is. I'm going to fight this 'padlock plan' with everything I've got.""    
The proposal will be debated as part of the fiscal year 2007 budget, which sets a framework for all government spending and appropriations for the coming year.

Senator Asks Secretary Of State Rice To Convene International Panel
March 13, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - Montana Senator Max Baucus today called on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to initiate an investigation into the potential environmental consequences of a proposed coal mine in British Columbia, near Glacier National Park.     
Baucus has been the leading opponent of the Cline Mining Company's proposal to mine coal on the headwaters of the North Fork Flathead River, which runs into Montana's Flathead Lake. He says there could be devastating consequences to Montana's fish, wildlife, and the recreation industry in the Flathead with ""zero economic benefits or jobs for Montanans.""     
""Glacier National Park, the Flathead River system and the clean, clear waters of Flathead Lake serve as the backbone of the economy of northwestern Montana,"" Baucus wrote in a letter to Rice today. ""This [mine] represents a renewed threat of degradation and destruction of social, environmental, and economic assets that are important to Montana.      
""In the face of this threat,"" Baucus continued, ""I strongly encourage you to request a hearing by the International Joint Commission on the current mining proposal.  It is of the utmost importance to Montana's outdoor heritage, and our nation's environmental legacy, to stop this mine and protect the Flathead River basin.""     
The International Joint Commission is a panel of both American and Canadian experts charged with preventing and resolving international disputes between the U.S. and Canada. The panel was instrumental, at Baucus' urging, in defeating a similar mining proposal in the same area in 1988.     
For the International Joint Commission to issue a finding on this case against the proposed coal mine, a hearing must be requested by the U.S. State Department, Baucus said.      
""Montana has always regarded the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, which formed the IJC, as an important tool,"" Baucus wrote. ""The investigation I am requesting would be an effective way of bringing that tool to bear in defense of Montanans' right to a healthy environment.""     
In a letter late last week, the U.S. State Department said that if the Canadian mining proposal moves forward ""significant adverse environmental effects"" may occur in the United States."" Baucus said the letter is a ""huge step forward in our efforts to stop the mine,"" but noted an IJC investigation is needed.     
Baucus is Montana's senior U.S. Senator and Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade policy.     
Baucus' letter to Secretary Rice to follow.  March 13, 2007    
  Dr. Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  Department of State  2201 C Street NW  Washington, D.C. 20520-0099    
  Dear Secretary Rice:    
The North Fork of the Flathead River, which rises in Canada, serves as the western boundary of Glacier National Park when it enters Montana.  It is a federal Wild and Scenic River, and it feeds into Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.  Glacier National Park, the Flathead River system and the clean, clear waters of Flathead Lake serve as the backbone of the economy of northwestern Montana.    
In December 1988, in reply to a 1984 referral by Secretary of State George Schultz and Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Joe Clark, the International Joint Commission (IJC) delivered a finding on a proposed coal mine in British Columbia.  The mine was to be located on a tributary of the Flathead River that flows into Montana.  The IJC unanimously concluded that pollution caused by the mine would constitute a breach of treaty obligations between the United States and Canada.  Subsequently, the mine proponent withdrew the coal development proposal.    
	There is now another proposal on the table for a coal mine in the same area.  This represents a renewed threat of degradation and destruction of social, environmental and economic assets that are important to Montana.  In the face of this threat, I strongly encourage you to request a hearing by the International Joint Commission on the current mining proposal.  It is of the utmost importance to Montana's outdoor heritage, and our nation's environmental legacy, to stop this mine and protect the Flathead River basin.    
	For the International Joint Commission to issue a finding on this case against the proposed coal mine, this hearing must be requested by the U.S. State Department.  Montana has always regarded the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, which formed the IJC, as an important tool.  The investigation I am requesting would be an effective way of bringing that tool to bear in defense of Montanans' right to a healthy environment.    
	Montanans are outdoor people.  We enjoy sharing our legacy of hunting and fishing with our children, and work hard to preserve our rivers, lakes, forests and rangelands for future generations.       
  This mining proposal presents serious risks to that valuable legacy in the Flathead River Basin and Glacier National Park.  I look forward to the opportunity to bring international scrutiny to mining plans that would degrade some of Montana's most pristine bodies of water.    
	Thank you in advance for your assistance in requesting an International Joint Commission hearing on the Flathead Basin mining proposal.  This is a critically important issue for Montanans.  Please feel free to contact me or my staff if we can be of any assistance in bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion.    
With best personal regards, I am    
  Sincerely,    
Max Baucus

Senator Pushes To Insure 12,000 Montana Children
October 13, 2007
    (Washington D.C.) Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus took to the airwaves today where he defended uninsured low-income children in Montana, and across the country.  Baucus delivered the Democratic National Radio address where he continued to build momentum in hopes of overriding the Presidential veto of the Childrens Health Insurance Program.  As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Baucus was the lead author of the CHIP bill which would have provided an additional $35 billion to the highly successful program in order to cover an additional 3.3 million low-income kids across the country, including 12,000 in Montana.  The bill passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate, but was then vetoed by the President.  Our new extension of CHIP would increase the number of eligible kids by more than 3 million  including 12,000 in my home State of Montana. Its hard to imagine the President telling millions of parents they dont deserve the same basic care for their kids that the President had for his, Baucus said during the address. But that is exactly what he did. And now its up to Congress to come together and override his veto  In order to override a Presidential veto, Baucus will have to secure a 2/3 vote in both the House and the Senate. When the bill was voted out of each chamber, the Senate had a veto proof majority, gaining 67 votes, but the House fell short by 25 votes.  As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Baucus was the lead author of the Childrens Health Insurance Program bill which provides health insurance to children from low-income families. The bill, which received wide support from both Democrats and Republicans as well as governors and advocacy groups, was vetoed by President Bush on October 3.  For all the talk about partisanship and gridlock in Washington, CHIP has been an amazing example of what government can do when we work together. Ten years ago, I was part of a team of Democrats and Republicans who sat down together to create the CHIP program, Baucus said We realized that giving kids the medical care they need isnt a Democratic priority or a Republican priority -- its an American priority,  The bill will now be sent back to the House of Representatives, where it will likely be voted on next week.  The radio address was broadcast nationally, and internationally, by the Associated Press, ABC, National Public Radio, CBS Radio, CNN Radio, C-SPAN radio, the Armed Forces Radio Network, and the BBC Radio network.  The radio address is given in response to the Presidents weekly radio address. Leaders picked Baucus to juxtapose the Presidents position on CHIP   -Text of Baucus radio address, as delivered, is below-  Good morning, this is Senator Max Baucus from Montana. For those of us who are parents, one of lifes greatest privileges and responsibilities is to give our children the chance for a better life than we had. From sporting events, to vacations, to graduations, even first dates, watching our children grow up is the greatest, and at times scariest, experience of our life.    And as a parent there is nothing worse than seeing your son or daughter in pain. In my home state of Montana, a mother named Fawn Tuhy knows this well. When Fawns daughter Abigail was two, Abigail fell down and split her head open. She had to have nine stitches. That same year, Abigails six-year-old brother broke his arm twice. Abigail and her two siblings get good medical care because they are among the six and a half million children covered by CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program. CHIP paid for Abigails stitches. CHIP covered her brothers surgery and hospital stay. And, through CHIP, Abigail gets the immunizations and checkups she needs to stay well.    For all the talk about partisanship and gridlock in Washington, CHIP has been an amazing example of what government can do when we work together. Ten years ago, I was part of a team of Democrats and Republicans who sat down together to create the CHIP program. We realized that giving kids the medical care they need isnt a Democratic priority or a Republican priority. Its an American priority.   This year, we worked together again to make CHIP even better. Our new extension of CHIP would increase the number of eligible kids by more than 3 million  including 12,000 in my home state of Montana. Its hard to imagine the President telling millions of parents they dont deserve the same basic care for their kids that the President had for his. But that is exactly what he did. And now its up to Congress to come together and override his veto.  Many Republicans have already committed to stand by their vote for CHIP. But many have not. Now, every Republican must decide whether they will stand with the President and his veto  or stand with our children and their right to a healthy future.  So for Abigail Tuhy, and the 12,000 children from Montana waiting for coverage, and for the millions more from coast to coast who need CHIP, I ask you to tell your Senators and Member of Congress to override President Bushs veto. This is America. All our children should be able to see a doctor. This is Senator Max Baucus from Montana. All the best.

Press Release: CHAIRMAN BAUCUS LAUNCHES UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PUSH

Senator Says All Montanans, Americans Have A Right To Quality, Affordable Health Care

 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
March 14, 2007
Washington, D.C.) - Montana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, today launched his initiative to get universal health care coverage for all Americans.    

During the first of what could be many Senate Finance Committee hearings on the subject, Baucus today rolled out a 5-point blueprint for fixing the nation's health care programs. Baucus called for universal health care coverage, insurance pooling arrangements, measures to cut costs, an increased emphasis on prevention, and shared responsibility. He said he wants to see every newborn in America sign up for health coverage before he or she leaves the hospital.    

""For too long, Congress has remained idle, as health care costs have spiraled out of control,"" Baucus said today. ""For too long, Congress has done nothing, as the ranks of the uninsured have grown.  The people of Montana and the nation deserve better. Today's hearing is the first step. I'm committed finding a common-sense solution so that all Montanans and Americans receive quality, affordable health care.""    

Baucus made clear that he's not endorsing a solely government-funded health care system, sometimes called ""single-payer,"" but rather he says a combination of private and public healthcare entities will likely be needed to cover all Americans.     

""One in six Americans does not have access to health care,"" Baucus said at today's hearing. ""And in my home state of Montana, an even greater percentage of people have limited access to health care:  1 in 5 Montanans lack health insurance.  Businesses struggle to continue to offer health benefits and remain competitive in the face of ever-increasing costs.  Employees grapple with having to pay more for coverage, while getting less care. It's not right and I'm going to work to right this wrong.""    

Baucus said that he's studied the proposals for moving towards universal health care and that he's optimistic that a solution can be reached - though it's going to take time and a lot of working together. He said there are five key principles to health care reform.    

Baucus' Health Care Reform Principles    
1) Universal coverage: Baucus said America is the only industrialized country in the world that doesn't guarantee health care for its citizens. He noted changes to America's health care system can't be addressed while leaving a growing portion of the country behind.     
2) Sharing the burden: Neither the employer-based system nor the individual market can fulfill the demand for affordable, portable, quality coverage, Baucus said.  One way to ensure affordable coverage is to create pooling arrangements.  Purchasing pools would bring together large numbers of small purchasers â both individuals and small businesses â and allow them to take advantage of group rates for coverage.    
3) Controlling costs: America cannot sustain its current rate of growth in health care spending, Baucus said, noting any serious proposal must reduce skyrocketing health care costs.    
4) Prevention: American health care tends to address what happens once people are already sick, Baucus said.  By making prevention the foundation of America's health care system, the country can avoid the high costs of treating an illness that has been allowed to progress.      
5) Shared responsibility: Baucus said everybody must shoulder the burden of a new health care system together, not one sector or entity - private or public.

Senator First-Ever Montanan To Chair Finance Committee
November 14, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Itâs official. Following a meeting of the Senate leadership today, Montana Senator Max Baucus will take over as chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee when the new Congress convenes in January.   

The Finance Committee, arguably the most influential panel in Congress, has jurisdiction over all taxes and revenue, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, welfare, and international trade policy. Baucus will wield significant clout over other legislation in the Congress as well.   

âI couldnât be more pleased,â? Baucus said today following a Democratic Caucus meeting. âThis is a very big deal for Montana. Being chairman will help me be even more effective for our state. Although taking the gavel puts me in a national leadership role, my number one goal is to do whatâs right for Montana and make folksâ lives better at home.â?   

Baucus, who has served on the Finance Committee since he was first elected to the Senate in 1978, is the first Montanan ever to chair the panel.   

Baucus said his top priorities on the panel will include:   

â¢           Lowering health care costs and providing quality care to all Montanans   
â¢           Boosting Montanaâs economy and creating more good-paying jobs   
â¢           Making America more energy independent and expanding alternative sources of energy, such as wind, biomass, and ethanol   
â¢           Cutting taxes for working Montana families   
â¢           Investing in education so Montana can better compete globally   
â¢           Knocking down trade barriers for Montanaâs high-quality agriculture products   

Baucus will also keep his other important committee assignments: Senate Agriculture, which will write the 2007 Farm Bill; and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over highway construction funding.   

Baucus is Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator. Heâs currently serving in his fifth consecutive six-year term in the U.S. Senate.   

Baucus has also been showing Montana Sen.-elect Jon Tester around Capitol Hill this week.   

âIâm committed to helping Jon and working with him to do whatâs right for Montana,â? said Baucus, a Helena native. âWeâre going to make a great team for Montana.â?

September 14, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today unveiled new education proposals that will establish an early education program in Montana, improve kindergarten through 12th grade education, help make higher education more affordable and help boost Montanaâs economy.  

Baucusâ Education Competitiveness Act of 2006 will send thousands more Americans to college to obtain science, math, and teaching degrees, and will help get millions more American children ready to learn early in life.  In addition to offering scholarships and even free tuition to many American college students, and creating a universal pre-kindergarten program, the Baucus proposal would also increase Pell Grants for college students, enhance tax incentives to support schools, and launch a host of other initiatives to improve American education.    

âMy top priority is boosting our stateâs economy and creating more good-paying jobs and education is the key ensuring we have a strong economic future,â? Baucus said. âBy investing in our children today, they will be able to have a brighter, more successful tomorrow.â?  

Baucus is introducing a series of bills to ensure that Montana and the entire country remains competitive with other countries and economies around the world. Baucusâ Education Competitiveness Act is the fifth in a series of competitiveness bills that heâs introduced so far this year.  


Baucusâ Education Competitiveness Act Provisions:   

â¢           Encouraging and rewarding teachers: To help students achieve their full potential, America must invest in teachers.  The Teaching Competitiveness Title creates full college scholarships for future teachers of math and science, foreign languages, and early education instruction.   It honors the commitment of teachers in rural and underserved areas with supplemental wages and incentives, and boosts the number of Advanced Placement teachers who can help the nationâs brightest students learn.    

â¢           Emphasizing early learning: Quality early education gives students a competitive edge throughout their lives.  Children who fall behind early in academics, however, fall even further behind in subsequent years.  The Early Education Title commits to a national voluntary universal pre-kindergarten education program for all income levels.    

Without changing existing early education programs, the Early Education Title matches state funding for a qualified program to provide voluntary, universal pre-kindergarten.  The title requires minimum standards for hours of instruction, teacher qualifications, and integration with K-12 education.  The program will increase matching funds as states increase their pre-kindergarten education accessibility, moving ultimately toward universal access in 2020.   

This title also creates grants to establish state-level pre-kindergarten through college (PK-16) collaboratives. These collaboratives will bring together stakeholders in pre-kindergarten, primary, secondary, and higher education to create a constructive forum to achieve a seamless, quality education for students.   

â¢           Extending learning beyond the school day: Enrichment activities can open new horizons for learning and provide encouragement to stay âon trackâ? academically and in life.  Recognizing this fact, the Enrichment Title supports language learning, college preparation, after-school activities, and mentoring programs to get students thinking creatively and to help them prepare for college.  Schools will design programs to meet their own childrenâs most pressing needs, from college preparation courses to crime or drug abuse prevention (including methamphetamine prevention efforts) to vocational training.   

â¢           Supporting every American student: Support for Indian education has fallen off sharply at the Federal level, and a renewed commitment is long overdue.  The Indian Education Title fully funds currently successful initiatives such as Johnson-OâMalley and native language immersion programs.  It also fully funds our nationâs Tribal Colleges.   

â¢           Giving adults learning opportunities for better employment: A competitive America never stops learning.  To keep the classroom open to Americans of all ages and skill levels, the Lifelong Learning Title encourages businesses and educators to help meet workforce needs.  This title also provides opportunities for colleges of technology to work with local businesses to encourage economic development and raise additional sources of funding as well as develop distance learning programs.   

â¢           Shaping the tax code to support education: Federal tax incentives are an efficient path to additional support for American education.  The Education Tax Incentives Title simplifies confusing tax credits by combining them into a single refundable Higher Education Credit of up to $2,000 per student for qualified tuition and related expenses.  Qualified tuition and related expenses means tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment required for enrollment.  Expenses of the taxpayer, taxpayerâs spouse or any dependent of the taxpayer, are also covered. A refundable credit will allow families and students to receive refunds when their educational tax credit exceeds their income tax liability.  This title will also ease the burden of loan repayment, permitting graduates to deduct more of the interest paid on their student loans.   

âI want to do all I can to ensure that jobs stay in Montana where they belong,â? said Baucus. âAnd I want to do my part to ensure that our children and grandchildren experience the same economic security and prosperity that we saw in the last century, America we have to value education again.  This bill will restore education as the foundation of a strong Montana and U.S. economy.â?  

The Baucus Education Competitiveness Act of 2006 is expected to be referred to the Finance Committee for initial consideration.   More information about each title of the bill can be found at http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/baucus.htm.

âNot so Fastâ Senator Says on Camping Trailer Plan at Lake

 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
December 15, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus says the Bureau of Reclamation should have gathered public input before establishing a new policy limiting the amount of time people can park camp trailers at Canyon Ferry Reservoir near Helena.   

Earlier this year the BOR established a new policy stating that visitors could not bring their trailers to Canyon Ferry to camp for an extended period of time. Prior to this new policy visitors could leave their campers and trailers at Canyon Ferry for an extended period of time, which saves people from having to haul the campers back and forth. Under the new policy visitors can only camp in their trailers for a few days at a time.   

âThat means folks have to pull their trailers out to the lake every time they want to spend a night or two,â? Baucus said. âThat doesnât seem fair to me. Whatâs more, the BOR just slapped this policy into place without getting input from the people who recreate at the Lake. Thatâs not right. And thatâs why we need to put the brakes on this until folks get a chance to weigh in.â?   

Baucus made his concerns clear in a letter to Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Robert Johnson. Baucus wants the agency to hold a public meeting in Helena on the subject as soon as possible.    

âAs with any new Federal policy, the public deserves to have the opportunity to provide comments, recommendations and suggestions,â? Baucus wrote to Johnson. âThese are public lands, and Montanans want to have a say in how they are managed.  As I understand this situation, the new policy for exclusive use was established without public comment in response to perceived problems in other states. I appreciate that your agency is responsible for public sites across the country.  However, each site is unique and has individual issues and new policy needs to be flexible and relevant to each situation.  Working together with communities and individuals who rely on these sites for recreation can produce a plan that ensures maximum access to well maintained, affordable recreation sites.â?  

âIt is of the utmost concern to me that the public have the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding this policy to prevent any irreparable consequences,â? wrote Baucus. âI am requesting that your staff responsible for drafting agency policy schedule a public meeting as soon as possible in Helena to gather the facts of this situation.â?  

Baucus said that heâs committed to working together with the BOR and Montanans to ensure that a common-sense solution is reached for camping at Canyon Ferry.  

âMontanans are outdoors people,â? Baucus said. âWe hunt, we fish, we take our kids out to the lake for the weekend. And we donât take it lightly when access to our public lands is limited.â?

(Washington, D.C.)  The head of the federal Medicare   program has accepted Montana Senator Max Baucus invitation to visit Montana next week to talk   to residents about the new prescription drug benefit   program. 
Baucus and Dr. Mark McClellan,   administrator of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, will host   town-hall meetings in both Butte and Great Falls on Wednesday,   February 22nd. McClellan oversees the new Medicare   Part D program, which will provide prescription drugs to seniors. Montana has more than   150,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The open forums are designed to help   alleviate confusion and answer questions about the new prescription drug plan,   which kicked in on January 1. Im very pleased Dr. McClellan has   accepted my invitation to come to Montana and help answers questions about the   new drug benefit, said Baucus, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate   Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Medicare program. Folks are   confused and these public meetings should be a big help. Baucus helped craft the new   prescription drug program in 2003 but has been critical of how its been   implemented, saying the more than 40 different plans seniors have to choose from   is far too many. Id like Dr. McClellan to hear from   folks directly about this program, Baucus said. At the end of the day, its   going to help provide seniors with the drugs they need, but as of now we are   seeing some bumps in the road. 
The forums are free and open to the   public. People are asked to contact Baucus Great   Falls office at (406) 761-1574 or Baucus Butte office (406) 782-8700   for more information.

June 15, 2005
 (WASHINGTON, D.C.) ---- As part of his ongoing efforts to protect Social Security for future generations of Montanans, Senator Max Baucus joined others today at a press conference on Capitol Hill to highlight how vital Social Security is for rural areas and how privatizing the program would create huge benefit cuts.    
Baucus is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over the federal retirement program for the elderly and disabled. He was joined by other rural-state lawmakers in announcing a new report that shows people in rural areas would take twice the hit to Social Security benefits under the privatization scheme being pushed by the White House. The report, released today by the Institute for America's Future, shows 163,000 or about 20 percent of Montanans depend on Social Security compared to California with 12 percent of Californians depending on the federal program.    
""Folks in Manhattan, Montana should not be put in the same category as folks in Manhattan, New York when it comes to Social Security needs,"" said Baucus, who Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) tapped to lead the national effort against the privatization plan. ""Representing a rural state, I know first hand how important Social Security is to rural folks. A plan that would threaten those benefits or cut benefits is unacceptable. I cannot and will not support a plan that would hurt Montanans or other rural folks.""    
Baucus said that momentum continues to build against privatizing Social Security. Groups that play a prominent role in rural areas like Montana such as the National Farmers Union, American Corn Growers Association, and National Family Farm Coalition are strongly against privatization.    
""The more details that come out about the plan to privatize Social Security it becomes more and more evident that it is a bad idea,"" Baucus said. ""I cannot and will not support a plan to privatize Social Security that would create huge benefit cuts and add trillions of dollars to the debt. I'll continue to do all I can to protect Social Security for Montanans and all Americans.""    
Baucus, Montana's senior U.S. Senator, has been leading the charge against privatizing Social Security and urging members of Congress and the Administration to work together to strengthen the federal retirement for the elderly and disabled for future generations.

June 15, 2005
(Washington, D.C.) -- Following a U.S. House of Representatives vote to slash funding for Amtrak, Montana Senator Max Baucus said today he will ""fight tooth and nail"" in the Senate to save the state's Empire Builder, which serves Montana 12 communities.    
""It's an outrage what the House has done,"" said Baucus, referring to an appropriations subcommittee vote today to slash the rail service program in half. ""This funding level is a death knell to the Empire Builder. Anti-Amtrak House members have just picked a fight with the Senate.""    
The House appropriations subcommittee set aside only $550 million for Amtrak, when the rail line requested $1.8 billion in federal funding. Amtrak CEO David Gunn said today that funding level would shutdown the rail service. Congress approved $1.2 billion for Amtrak last year.    
The next stop for the spending bill is the full House appropriations committee, on which Montana's Congressman Dennis Rehberg sits.    
""Denny clearly has his hands full,"" Baucus said. ""And I'm committed to helping out in anyway I can on the House side. But I can tell you this isn't going to fly in the Senate. Amtrak is a vital lifeline to our Hi-Line communities.""    
Baucus is working to build a coalition of Senators to block the cuts. The Empire Builder route in Montana serves Hi-Line Communities, Glacier National Park, White Fish, and Libby en route from Minneapolis to Seattle.    
""We will not let this war against rural travel stand,"" said Baucus, the state's senior U.S. Senator and top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.    
He said it's unfair for more profitable routes in the northeast to be funded at the expense of service in Montana.

Senator's Measure Would Help Boost Clean Energy Production, Less Dependence On Foreign Oil
June 15, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  As the U.S. Senate debates a new energy bill, Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus unveiled his tax incentive package for developing clean energy, which provides incentives for developing clean and green power, alternative vehicles and biofuels, and clean coal technologies.  Baucus is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over all taxes and revenue. Baucus said he expects the Finance Committee to take up his tax incentive package next week, and that the provisions could ultimately be folded in to the larger energy measure before the Senate.  I want to do all I can to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and boost energy production here at home, Baucus said. This tax incentive package will encourage cleaner, greener energy and will help create more good-paying jobs.  Baucus measure contains a new tax credit for cellulosic ethanol production. It also has new initiatives to promote wind energy, including a new residential tax credit, and incentives for connecting rural wind facilities to the energy grid. Other first-ever proposals include provisions to speed the development of plug-in hybrid vehicles, and provisions to increase the economic viability of capturing carbon from coal.   Baucus Energy Tax Incentive Package Includes:  Boosting Domestic Energy Production:  Extends for two years and modifies the clean energy production tax credit (Section 45) for renewable energy producers, providing a tax credit for every kilowatt hour added to the energy grid. Baucus intends to expand this extension through 2013.   Accelerates depreciation for transmission lines connecting renewable energy facilities (such as wind farms) to the grid. Builders of transmission lines can write off 50 percent of equipment costs in the first year of use.   Creates a new 30 percent investment tax credit for residential applications of wind energy, up to $4000 per recipient.   Increases funding for new clean coal technology projects that will sequester at least 70% of carbon emissions.  Establishes Clean Coal Bonds to encourage clean coal efforts by co-ops, tribes, and municipalities.   Extends through 2010 the 30 percent investment tax credit for residential solar projects (Section 25D), and increases the limit to as much as $4000 per recipient.   Extends through 2010 the 30 percent investment tax credit (Section 48) for solar, fuel cells and 10 percent investment tax credit for microturbines.   Promoting Alternative Vehicles and Biofuels:  Establishes a new tax credit starting at $2500 for buyers of new plug-in hybrid vehicles.  Establishes a new tax credit for the production of cellulosic ethanol, offering up to $1.11 for the first 60 million gallons of production per year up to one billion gallons.   Extends through 2010 the $1-per-gallon biodiesel credit (produced from soy, camelina, and other plant materials) to 2010, with no limit for a single facilitys production.   Extends through 2012 the 30 percent credit (up to $30,000) for installing E-85 alternative energy fueling stations that can service flex-fuel cars running on 85% ethanol fuel.   Extends the small producers credit (those with annual capacity of 60 million gallons or less) for biodiesel and ethanol, which provides a 10 cent per gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of production.  Boosting Domestic Oil and Gas Production  Promoting Energy Savings:  Extends through 2009 incentives for reducing energy costs in existing homes and increases standards for receiving the credit.   Extends through 2010 incentives for reducing energy costs in new homes and commercial buildings, and increases credit to $2.25 per square foot in commercial buildings.  Extends incentive for producing oil and natural gas from marginal wells.   Permits through 2015 the 50% bonus (first-year) depreciation of investments for facilities increasing the use of nonconventional feedstocks by 25% from domestic resources such as oil sands, tar sands, and oil shale.

June 15, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today applauded the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for agreeing to increase flows on the Bighorn River.   Baucus said today that BOR area manager Dan Jewell confirmed that the agency will increase flows from 1,500 cubic feet per second to 1,750 cfs starting late in the day on June 15.  Im pleased the BOR has recognized the importance of the Bighorn River to Montanas economy, Baucus said. This flow level strikes a more equitable compromise between water users in Wyoming and Montana. Its not exactly what we wanted, but it shows progress and gives hope to Montana sportsmen and women, small businesses and our states economy.  Baucus has been an outspoken critic of the BORs management of Yellowtail Dam. Hes led the charge to increase flows in the river, along with Senator Jon Tester, Governor Brian Schweitzer, and Congressman Denny Rehberg. Baucus also praised the work of interested groups including Friends of the Bighorn River, Montana Trout Unlimited and the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.  Doug Haacke, one of the organizers of the Friends of the Bighorn River (FOBR), a grassroots effort formed to protect the Bighorn, said While the increase of 250 cubic feet per second is modest, and still well below the desired minimums, FOBR realizes we're not out of the drought cycle yet. However, a fishery is only as healthy as its water supply, and any increase is good thing at this point, especially since we've been maintaining absolute minimum flows for a year.  Haacke praised Montana Senator Max Baucus for his steadfast efforts in protecting the river and its vibrant economy. Max has been essential in carrying the message that we've suffered during the drought just like other water users, and that we're just looking for equity amongst the water recreation stakeholders, Haacke said.  While praising the BORs efforts, Baucus urged officials to consider increasing flows even more if weather conditions and water levels allow.  Following multiple years of drought, Wyo. and Mont. have been at odds over water levels in Bighorn Lake and the Bighorn River.  -30-

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) --Senator Max Baucus, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate's international trade panel, said today he's confident Japan will reopen its borders to U.S. beef soon.    
Immerging from a meeting he co-hosted with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley of Iowa, Baucus said Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Ryozo Kato, assured him Japan will make good on its promise to allow beef from cattle younger than 20 months of age into the country.    
Japan, previously the largest export market for Montana beef, imposed a ban on all U.S. beef imports in 2003 after a Washington state dairy cow that originated in Canada tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Japanese and American scientists recently recommended lifting the ban on U.S. beef that comes from cows under 20 months of age because it poses no risk of having the disease.    
""We'll keep pushing because exporting our high-quality ag products is key to Montana's economy and jobs on Main Streets,"" Baucus said. ""Our producers have had a rough enough go of it with the drought -- the Japan ban has only added insult to injury.""    
Senators Grassley and Baucus arranged the private meeting between the Senators and the Ambassador to allow Senators to have a candid discussion on the status of the resumption of beef trade with Japan.    
""The Ambassador assured us that progress is being made. He said that Japan intends to allow beef from cattle under 20 months of age to enter its borders after its rulemaking process is complete,"" Baucus said. ""I will continue to follow this situation to make sure we get Japan opened up as soon as possible.""    
Japan imported $1.3 billion of U.S. beef in 2003 alone.    
""The Japanese are working to lift the ban, but there is a sense -- even among some Japanese -- that the sluggish pace of progress so far is driven more by politics than science,"" Baucus said.

March 15, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) -- Amtrak is too important to communities and jobs across the country to be eliminated, Senator Max Baucus said today during a Capitol Hill news conference.    
As lawmakers grapple with a fiscal year 2006 budget, Baucus and others are fighting to restore funding for Amtrak, which would be eliminated under President Bush's budget request. The rail line stops in 12 communities in Montana, stretching across the Hi-Line, and through White Fish and Libby.    
Baucus joined Senators Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.),Tom Carper (D-Del.), and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), as well as rail advocates from across the country, in urging Congress to accept an amendment that would fund Amtrak at $1.4 billion next year.    
""Amtrak is vital to my state of Montana -- it's critical to us,"" Baucus said at a press conference today. ""Ridership is up. It's rising. It doesn't make sense to cut funding for this important transportation system. It does make sense to give full U.S. support and give full financial support to Amtrak. This is about jobs and Montana's economy.""    
Earlier this year, Baucus and other senators wrote the Senate Budget Committee urging members to provide full funding for Amtrak. The senators noted that Amtrak's five-year strategic plan that specifies that approximately $1.8 billion will be required for fiscal year 2006 to provide safe and efficient operation of the railroad.    
Baucus noted that Amtrak's ""Empire Builder"" had an increased ridership of 5.7 percent last year and contributes $14 million annually to the state in economic benefits. In 2004, Amtrak employed 57 Montanans with wages totaling $3.2 million, Baucus said.    
""Amtrak is our lifeblood,"" Baucus said. ""We rely on it to travel around the state for our jobs and to visit our family and friends. Amtrak connects people and businesses. Eliminating this rail system would be devastating to the people and communities of Montana. I'm going to work together with my Senate colleagues to keep this transportation program around for years to come.""

March 15, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus is offering an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 budget that would reverse a $19 million cut to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program, which has helped law enforcement battle methamphetamine in Montana.    
The federal program helps law enforcement officials battle illicit drugs across the country, including in Montana through the Rocky Mountain HIDTA.    
The HIDTA program brought $500,000 to Montana in both fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Funding for Montana increased in fiscal year 2005 to $983,000, and in fiscal year 2006 the state received $1.06 million, when the program was funded nationally at $227 million.     
Baucus' amendment would fund HIDTA at last year's level of $227 million. The Bush Administration has proposed $208 million for fiscal year 2007.    
""That's not enough,"" Baucus said. ""We need every penny we can get to fight meth in Montana.""    
Baucus waged a two-year campaign to get Montana into the Rocky Mountain HIDTA, which since 2002 has helped Montana law enforcement officials cut in half the number of meth labs busted in Montana.  The five Montana counties included in the Rocky Mountain HIDTA are Cascade, Flathead, Lewis and Clark, Missoula, and Yellowstone.    
""Meth has exploded in Montana and all over the country,"" Baucus said. ""Cutting the HIDTA program would level a devastating blow to our efforts and would deal a huge setback to the war against meth. We can't afford to lose the ground we've gained.""    
Baucus helped lead the charge to save HIDTA last year, when the Bush Administration proposed cutting the program in half.    
""Every where I go, every meeting I have with law enforcement folks in Montana, I hear the same thing over and over again,"" Baucus said, ""meth is the number one problem they face.""    
Methamphetamine is a powerful and highly addictive central nervous system stimulant that is associated with violence because it can cause paranoia, aggression, and mood swings.    
Baucus said he expects the Senate to take action on his amendment today or tomorrow.

September 15, 2005
(Washington, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus today   traveled to the Gulf Coast to assess Hurricane Katrina damage   and relief efforts as he helps craft a federal aid package aimed at rebuilding   the area and helping storm victims. 
Baucus was asked by Senate leaders   to join a small envoy on a visit that is making stops in New Orleans, La.,   Biloxi, Miss. and Mobile, Ala. Baucus was asked to join the Senate delegation   because he is leading Congressional negotiations on a relief package that would   help rebuild the Gulf Coast region and provide the victims of Hurricane Katrina   with health care, housing, employment, and education assistance. The devastation is incredible    its much worse in person than the pictures we see in the paper and on TV  its   amazing, said Baucus, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance   Committee. Im glad that I have the opportunity to come and see first hand   whats happening here so I can help provide the assistance that is needed to get   these people back on their feet. Also, Im letting people down here know that as   far away as Montana, we're all a part of the process  that Montanans are doing   all they can to help ease the pain and devastation. We're a part of this team   effort. We're very happy to be helpful. 
Baucus was one of 14 senators on the   tour -- seven Democrats and seven Republicans  led by Democratic Leader Harry   Reid of Nevada and Majority Leader Bill Frist   of Tennessee.  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina,   Congress is working on sweeping relief packages to help victims and rebuild the   area. On Thursday, the Senate passed a tax incentive package that Baucus and   Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to encourage   charitable contributions, house evacuees, and create job opportunities. That   plan is being reconciled with a similar House-passed version and is expected to   be signed by President Bush early next week. The Baucus and Grassley Tax   Incentive Package for Katrina Victims:  Providing a $500 tax   deduction to people who house hurricane victims for at least 60   days; Tax incentives to help   employers keep workers on their payrolls and hire victims of the storm;  Raising limits on   charitable donations of cash, food and books by businesses;  
Allowing the disaster   victims to withdraw money from tax preferred retirement savings accounts without   penalty. Waive laws requiring   that taxes be paid on discharged debts, such as mortgages, when the debts are   forgiven in response to Katrina damage  Also late Thursday night, Baucus and   Grassley introduced their health care relief package to ensure victims of   Hurricane Katrina get access to health care and other assistance. The senators   expect swift passage of the health care package, as early as Monday. The Baucus-Grassley Health Care   Relief Package For Katrina Victims:  Immediate Access to   Medicaid for Displaced Individuals 
Federal Support for   Affected States Medicaid Programs  Prevent cuts to all   state Medicaid programs in 2006 (Montana was set to lose $10   million) Compensation to Affected   Health Providers Waive Medicare Rx-Drug   benefit enrollment penalties Tapping into a $2   billion welfare contingency fund for low-income   families 
Ensure Future Assistance   to Families Waive Hospital Reporting   Requirements in Disaster Areas Fully reimburse   hospitals for Medicare and waive co-payment Extend Unemployment   Benefits by 13 weeks  Baucus is also meeting with American   Red Cross President and CEO Marsha Evans in Biloxi, Miss. and will   present her with $50,000 in donations raised by Suttons Sportswear in   Billings. Suttons sponsored an event Sunday   that drew more than 4,000 people and raised funds to help victims of the storm.   The Gulf Coast Benefit in the parking lot of Sutton's included live music, food,   and raffles. Organizers sold thousands of specialty T-shirts, which made up the   bulk of the contributions to date. 
Upon returning to Washington, Baucus will   explore ways to provide additional assistance to Hurricane Katrina   victims.

February 16, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - Montana Senator Max Baucus has cancelled a trip to Iraq to instead stay in Washington and debate the war in the U.S. Senate this weekend.     

Baucus was slated to be the senior member of a delegation visiting Iraq, Israel and Jordan. But he decided to scrap the trip after a vote on whether or not to debate the war was scheduled in the Senate on Saturday.     

""It's clear the American people want a debate on this issue,"" Baucus said on the Senate floor Friday. ""There's no doubt about that. For the U.S. Senate to not vote would be irresponsible. This is the most fundamental issue on Americans' minds.""     

Baucus called the situation in Iraq ""a mess"" and said that it's time for the Iraqi government to stand on its own.     

He's not going on the trip because he wants ""to be here to cast my vote and start debating,"" Baucus said. ""That's the right thing to do.""    

""I was going to go to Iraq tonight because I wanted to see firsthand what's going on,"" he said. ""I want to talk to troops. I want to talk to the commanders. I want to talk to not only American personnel but also Iraqis. I wanted to determine. . . if the Iraqis are able to stand on their own two feet and do what they're supposed to do - that is govern and run their own country.""     

In his speech on the Senate floor, Baucus said ""it doesn't make much sense to throw more troops at the problem"" and that it's time the Iraqi government ""sober up and start getting their act together.""     

""We did a good thing by toppling Saddam Hussein,"" he said. ""But we did not have an exit strategy. We should not continue a failed policy. I don't think anyone has the silver bullet. But we need to give the Iraqis a set date. If we don't, they think we'll just continue to take care of them.""    

Baucus stressed the need to engage other countries in the region.     

""If you want a solution you have to talk to people,"" Baucus said. ""In life, you talk to your friends but you also talk to your enemies. The stakes are so high, the consequences so great. I strongly urge the administration to engage and start talking. It's not going to be easy. But I don't know of an alternative.""     

Baucus, first elected in 1978, said the war in Iraq is one of the most serious issues he's ever confronted in the Senate.     

""If the Iraqis aren't taking care of themselves, why should we take care of them,"" Baucus asked. ""We've lost so many American lives, so many Montanans. And it makes no sense, in my judgment, to keep doing this.""

Senatorâs Measure Would Protect Flows, Fish on World-Class Montana River
January 16, 2007
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) ââ Montana Senator Max Baucus today stepped up his efforts to protect the Bighorn River by introducing legislation that would block officials from further lowering flows out of Yellowtail Dam.   

Baucusâ bill comes on the heels of a standing-room-only  meeting he held Sunday in Billings, where more than 100 anglers and local business owners crowded into a conference room to hear the senior U.S. senator tell officials that current plans to reduce flows are unacceptable.   

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which controls flows on the Bighorn River, plans to set flows at 1,500 cubic feet per second. Fisheries biologists say that flow level would be devastating to fish numbers.  Baucus doesnât want flows to go below 2,500 cfs, a minimum flow to maintain a healthy fishery.  

âThe Bighorn is a lifeline for southeast Montana,â? Baucus said. âThis river is internationally known as one of the best trout streams on the globe. We will not stand by and let it be dewatered. Montana has given enough.â?    

Baucus said maintaining adequate flows in the Bighorn River âspeaks to the soul and pads the wallet,â? noting fishing on the river generates more than $30 million in economic activity every year.   

The Bighorn River Protection Act would do four things, Baucus said.   

1)    Sets preferred minimum flows at 2,500 cubic feet per second (cfs).  
2)    Sets absolute (only to be used in extreme situations) minimum of 1,500 cfs  
3)    States that one of the purposes of the Yellowtail dam project is for the maintenance of a healthy fishery on the Bighorn River. (Currently, the dam is authorized only for flood control and power generation.)  
4)    Requires the BOR to coordinate management of all four BOR reservoirs in the Bighorn watershed.   

Baucus is chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Finance Committee.   

Montanaâs other U.S. Senator, Jon Tester, signed on today as a cosponsor of Baucusâ legislation.

March 16, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) - At a press conference on Capitol Hill today, U.S. Senators Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) rolled out S. 2426 that will protect children from online predators and pornography by requiring Web sites with adult content to have a .XXX domain.    
In related news, the Senate accepted a Baucus amendment to the fiscal year 2007 budget that would establish an Internet Crimes Against Children task force in Montana. The provision calls for $250,000 to help local law enforcement officials crack down on Internet predators.     
Baucus and Pryor's legislation would require the Secretary of Commerce to negotiate with the international NGO-- Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to develop a special domain name for Web sites with adult content. ICANN is charged with selecting domain names such as .gov, .com, .org, .net, and .edu. Baucus said the U.S. Department of Commerce would fine Web sites that don't comply with the new .XXX domain.    
Baucus said the .XXX domain will help parents use filtering software to keep kids from access pornographic sites. The domain will also help people avoid visiting adult-content sites by mistake, he said.    
""This bill will section off a piece of the Internet neighborhood and confine adult sites to one location,"" Baucus said. ""It will give parents more tools to protect our kids. Parents should not have to worry about their children surfing into Web sites for adults â either on purpose or by accident.""    
""While the Internet is an exceptional learning tool, it allows children the same easy access to Web sites about space shuttles as it does for pornography. Turning a blind eye to this problem has allowed the online pornography industry to expand and enabled kids to view adult content at very young ages,"" Pryor said.  ""By corralling pornography in its own domain, our bill provides parents with the ability to create a 'do not enter zone' for their kids.""    
The .XXX domain and cyber crime task force are both part of Baucus' Cyber Safety for Kids initiative, which is designed to protect children from adult content on the Internet, sexual predators on the web, and exploitation of minors.    
In addition to introducing legislation, Baucus is holding town hall meetings in Montana with parents, teachers, students, law enforcement officials and others from across the state to talk about ways to protect children from cyber crimes.    
""The Internet is a great resource,"" Baucus said. ""By working together we can help protect our children from online predators and allow them to surf the web safely. I'm committed to working together with Senator Pryor to help pass this important legislation.""    
The new Internet Crimes Against Children task force will be based in Montana. Montana is currently part of a regional ICAC based in Utah. Officials tell Baucus the state needs its own crime-fighting unit to combat the growing number of Internet crimes in the state.    
Now that the Senate has accepted Baucus' amendment to establish the cyber crime task force, the provisions will pass along with the fiscal year 2007 budget, likely by the end of the week, Baucus said. The Baucus-Pryor Legislation is likely to be referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce.

Following Weds Deadline, Senator Pushes To Nix Late-Fee So More Seniors Can Sign-Up
May 16, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Following the Monday deadline for seniors to sign up for prescription drug coverage, Montana Senator Max Baucus today introduced legislation to waive a late fee seniors would have to pay if they still want to sign up for the new Medicare Part D program.   

At a press conference on Capitol Hill, Baucus, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, teamed up with Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the panelâs chairman, to introduce the legislation.  

Baucus was a co-author of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which created the new prescription drug benefit. He has since been critical of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), saying the agency that runs Medicare ignored warnings that approving too many plans would be confusing to seniors. Montana seniors have more than 40 plans to choose from.   

The deadline for seniors to enroll in the new Medicare prescription drug program was Monday, May 15. Under the 2003 law, seniors who hadnât enrolled as of Monday will be charged a 7-percent penalty, or about $2.00, on their drug premiums per month, for as long as they stay in the program.   

Baucus noted that while some seniors enrolled, many were confused by the process and didnât sign up. The next opportunity to sign up for the program will be later this year â starting on November 15.   

âThe Medicare prescription drug benefit is way too complicated and Montana seniors deserve some breathing room while trying to make heads and tails of their options,â? Baucus said. âOur seniors deserve access to quality, affordable prescription drugs and should not be penalized for the mistakes made by CMS in implementing the new drug program. This common sense legislation will enable seniors to take their time in finding the right prescription drug program that fits them â without being penalized.â?   

Baucusâ bill would also provide an additional $18 million for counseling to help seniors sign up for the prescription drug program, such as Senior Health Insurance Information Programs and Area Agencies on Aging.  

âThe additional dollars will really help seniors in rural areas like Montana,â? Baucus said. âOne of my top priorities to provide Montana seniors with the prescription drugs they need at a price they deserve. Iâm confident that by working together with my Senate colleagues we can make that happen.â?

November 16, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus today railed against a spending bill that guts programs aimed at fighting methamphetamines in Montana.    
In a speech before the Senate, Baucus said heâll vote against the fiscal year 2006 spending bill for commerce, justice, and science because it slashes funds for the Community Oriented Policing program, or COPS, as well as the Byrne Memorial grant and the Justice Assistance grant programs.    
These programs have been instrumental in the battle against meth in Montana, Baucus said, noting the funding cut will deal a devastating blow to Montana's seven regional drug task forces, especially those in the state's rural areas.    
The Senate was expected to approve the spending bill Wednesday afternoon and then send it to President Bush for his signature.    
""I'm outraged that this bill will make further cuts to critical programs that help local law enforcement fight methamphetamine nationwide,"" Baucus said on the Senate floor today. ""These cuts will have a particularly damaging impact on my state of Montana because we are a rural state with limited resources.""    
Although the Senate-passed version of the bill adequately funded the meth-fighting programs, the joint House-Senate conference committee version would cut them drastically, Baucus said.    
That same panel also removed the Senate-passed Combat Meth Act, which will, among other things, require products containing meth-making ingredients to be held behind the counter at retail stores.    
Baucus said the cuts will be particularly painful to the Eastern Montana Drug Task Force based in Miles City, the Tri-Agency Drug Task Force in Havre near the Canadian border, and the Big Muddy Drug Task Force in Wolf Point because they rely entirely on Byrne funding.    
""These task forces also happen to cover some of the most open and rural areas in my state, where meth enforcement is particularly challenging,"" Baucus said.      
Baucus said the bill cuts the COPS program by one-third, and provides no funding for communities to hire additional police officers.    
In a separate but related move, Baucus also teamed up with Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today to introduce a bill that will set national standards for cleaning up meth labs, so Montana law enforcement officials can better clean up the hazardous byproducts associated with meth production.    
""We cannot afford to lose the ground we've gained in our fight to rid meth from Montana communities,"" said Baucus, who has led a statewide education, treatment, and prevention campaign against the drug in Montana.    
""Everywhere I go, the story is the same,"" Baucus said, ""Montana law enforcement need more resources to win the war against meth  - not less.""    
Methamphetamine is a powerful and highly addictive central nervous system stimulant that is associated with violence because it can cause paranoia, aggression, and mood swings. The byproducts of making meth are highly toxic and flammable and require specially trained personnel to clean them up, costing the state of Montana millions of dollars every year.

April 17, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - All four of Montana's top elected officials united today in opposition to a plan that will reduce flows and hurt trout numbers on the Bighorn River.     
Sen. Max Baucus spearheaded a letter signed by Sen. Jon Tester, Rep. Denny Rehberg and Governor Schweitzer to U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Robert Johnson.     
For the first time, the four leaders united in opposition to a flow schedule announced April 9 by BOR officials that they say could eliminate an entire age class of fish in the river below Yellowtail Dam.     
""We are particularly frustrated by the Bureau's lack of accountability to the public,"" Baucus, Tester, Rehberg, and Schweitzer wrote, calling the move ""a wholesale disregard for traditional federal agency-state channels of communication.""     
The Montana officials are taking issue with the BOR for reversing a decision announced during a public meeting in Billings on March 21 that would have bumped flows in the river to 2,000 cubic feet per second in May, during the critical rainbow trout spawn.     
On April 9, BOR officials reversed the March decision and said they will keep a flow level of 1,500 cfs until June.      
The Delegation and Governor said the new flow plan will ""result in dry side channels and the absence of an entire age class of wild trout on one of the nation's premier trout streams.""     
The leaders also said the April 9 decision came ""as a complete surprise.""    
""In the three weeks since the BOR presentation in March, the only new development has been the unexpected but welcome and significant amount of precipitation in the basin,"" the Montana leaders wrote. ""We expect the courtesy of being alerted to these reversals in management direction.""     
In addition to hurting fish numbers in the river, the Montana leaders said the decision could level a blow to the local economy as well.     
""In addition to unacceptable impacts to the fishery, this action, if uncorrected, will have a devastating effect on the local economy,"" the leaders wrote. ""The 70,000 to 90,000 angler days on the Bighorn River make it one of the most valuable trout fisheries in the country. These facts make the BOR decision inexplicable.""     
""We do not accept the latest decision by the Bureau of Reclamation on Bighorn River stream flows as final,"" the letter concluded. ""We urge you to work with us in revisiting the Bureau's flow schedule, and finding a better solution.""

Senator 'Disappointed' In Failure to Debate the War
February 17, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - The U.S. Senate today rejected an effort to proceed to a debate over the war in Iraq. Proceeding to a debate required a 60-vote super majority. The effort failed on a vote of 56 to 34.     

Baucus, who voted to proceed to a debate, released the following statement.     

""Our job as United States Senators is to debate the tough issues facing our nation. If we can't debate, we can't do our job. A teacher can't just decide not to show up to class, or a farmer can't just decide not to harvest. As an employee of 900,000 Montanans I want to work hard and do my job.     

""It's time for Republicans and Democrats put aside our differences, debate this issue, and work together to find the best way to get Iraq to stand on its own two feet. I cancelled my trip to Iraq this weekend because I wanted to stay and debate the most important issue facing America in a generation. But we were denied an open and honest debate. That does a disservice to our country and the democratic process. I'm very disappointed.""

January 17, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) âMontana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, today passed out of his committee a new tax relief package to boost small businesses.  

âMontana is a small business state,â? Baucus said. âSmall business is the engine that drives our economy and creates jobs on Main Streets. Thatâs why Iâm proud we are getting them some tax relief from Uncle Sam.â?  

Baucusâ tax relief package includes credits for small businesses that hire hard-to-employ workers, increased deductions for improving buildings, and measures to help small businesses simplify their bookkeeping. His bill passed the Finance Committee today unanimously.   

As of 2003, Montana had nearly 34,000 small businesses, which represents 97.7 percent of all businesses in Montana, the Small Business Administration reports.  The number of people who were self-employed in that same year totaled 61,726.  

Baucus said his tax incentives are likely to be coupled with an increase in the minimum wage, something Baucus says is past due for Montanaâs workers.   

âTo call a minimum wage increase âoverdueâ is the understatement of the year,â? Baucus said. âItâs high time our workers get a raise. At the same time we are going to give a boost to small businesses.â?   

Following the Finance Committee action today, Baucusâ bill is ready to be debated on the floor of the Senate, likely the week of January 29.  

Baucusâ bill includes the following provisions to help Montanaâs small businesses:  

â¢           Workforce Opportunity:  The bill provides a five-year extension of the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce and expands it to include veterans disabled after the September 11, 2001 attacks.   

â¢           Small Business Expensing: Small business expensing helps small business owners buy new equipment and property.  This provision allows small businesses to deduct up to $108,000 of qualified equipment (such as: tractors and other ranch or farm equipment, copiers or other office equipment) or property expenses in the year that the equipment or property is bought, allowing businesses to recover the cost of equipment more quickly and simplify bookkeeping.   

â¢           Restaurant improvements: Allows leaseholders and restaurants to quickly recover the cost of improvements to their establishments, over 15-years rather than over the normal 39-year recovery period.     

â¢           Cash-basis accounting: Simplifies the way small businesses keep records for tax purposes.  The cash-basis accounting method is the preferred method of accounting for self-employed individuals as it is much simpler. Under cash-basis accounting, small business owners do not report income until payment is received.  This provision is only available to small businesses that have less than $5 million in gross receipts.

March 17, 2005
(Washington, D.C.) --Senator Max Baucus today helped restore drastic Bush Administration cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care to low-income families and people with disabilities.    
Baucus cosponsored an amendment to restore $15 billion in cuts to the program. The amendment to the fiscal year 2006 budget, sponsored by Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), passed 52-48. The fight isn't over yet, but today's action is ""a major victory,"" Baucus said.    
If President Bush's budget request to Congress is enacted without any changes, Montana could lose up to $130 million in Medicaid funding over a five-year period, Baucus said, noting 2,800 seniors or more than 12,000 children could lose their health care coverage.    
""These cuts would hurt real people,"" Baucus said during a speech on the Senate floor, where he called the cuts ""shortsighted"". Baucus is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over Medicaid.    
About 83,000 Montanans are currently enrolled in Medicaid, Baucus said.    
""We scored a major victory today in our efforts to provide quality, affordable health care to all Montanans,"" Baucus said. ""Medicaid is a vital program in Montana. It provides health care for thousands of Montanans who otherwise would not be able to afford it. Providing quality, affordable health care for all Montanans is one of my top priorities and I'm committed to helping make sure that all Montanans have health care coverage.""    
Baucus noted that health providers like hospitals and nursing homes across Montana would feel the impact from the budget cut the most.    
""It's completely outrageous that during the economic times that we're in that our state would have to shoulder the burden of paying the federal share for Medicaid,"" Baucus said. ""It's not right. It's not fair. And I'm going to fight these cuts every step of the way.""    
For every $1 million Montana spends on Medicaid, more than $4.7 million in new business activity is generated and just over 57 new jobs are created, Baucus said, noting ""Montana can ill afford to lose this business revenue and economic development.""

November 17, 2006
(BUTTE, Mont.) â U.S. Senator Max Baucus today announced that Microsoft founder Bill Gates and long-time NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw will headline a fourth statewide Montana Economic Development Summit in Butte on April 30 and May 1.    

During a news conference today in Butte, Baucus said he picked the Mining City to hold the fourth statewide economic development conference because Butte is centrally located and the town has a burgeoning high tech industry. Montana Tech of The University of Montana will host the event on its campus.     

Baucus organized the first-ever statewide economic development summit in Great Falls in 2000. He held another summit the following year in Great Falls and again in Billings in 2003. Each Summit attracted more than 1,000 people, including economic development leaders from across the state and nation.     

The Montana Economic Development Summit is free and open to the public. This yearâs theme is âinnovationâ? and will explore ways to foster the entrepreneurial spirit in Montana and how Montanans can better market their products and ideas.     

The two-day conference will include a speech by Gates live via satellite. Brokaw will speak before the conference in person. The Summit will also include break-out sessions focusing on a range of economic development issues, from energy to entrepreneurship to education. Additional speakers and details about the Summit will be announced over the next few months.      

âThis is all about jobs,â? Baucus said. âThe Summit is about working together to boost our stateâs economy and create more good-paying jobs. We want our kids to be able to stay here and raise their families.â?     

We all have ideas on bringing more jobs to our state. By working together, we can bring more folks to the table to forge a road map for Montanaâs economic future.â?    
As in past summits, the ideas gathered at the breakout sessions will be given to lawmakers, the Governorâs Office of Economic Opportunity and its Economic Advisory Council.     

""It is very fitting to have this yearâs Economic Summit on the campus, not only because Montana Tech is the Montana University System campus whose primary role is math, science and engineering, but because it fits very well with Senator Baucusâ congressional program for increasing our competitive advantage which has the potential to do for American competitive advancement what the NDEA program did in response to Sputnik,"" said Montana Tech Chancellor Frank Gilmore.    

As in years past, Baucus said the stateâs top elected leaders â Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Sen.-elect Jon Tester and Rep. Dennis Rehberg â will be invited to co-host the Summit.    

For more information, people are asked to contact Matt Jones at 406-329-3123.

January 18, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) -- Montana Senator Max Baucus today outlined changes in the tax code that benefit Montanas farmers and ranchers during the 2005 tax season.  
These new changes, which Baucus helped craft as part of a 2004-passed bill to boost domestic manufacturing  also known as the JOBS Act  include a new manufacturing tax deduction for agriculture businesses, relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax, and more time to replace livestock sold on account of drought. Baucus helped craft the new law as the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes. He said many agriculture producers are preparing their 2005 taxes, and that they should look into whether or not they can benefit from the new provisions.  I know how hard Montanans work, and I want to ensure that they keep as much of their income as possible, Baucus said. These new provisions will help many producers avoid an additional tax hit from Uncle Sam. Because this is tax filing season for most farmers and ranchers, Baucus wants to ensure they have this information as soon as possible. He said producers can either contact the IRS, or see a financial planner for more information.  The new tax provisions include: 
 New Manufacturing Tax Deduction: The law allows a 3 percent deduction on 2005 taxes for agricultural production income. The deduction increases over the next several years to 9 percent by 2010. Livestock Drought Conversion: The law doubles the amount of time ranchers have during declared drought disasters to sell and then rebuild their herds without taking a tax hit. The provision also allows ranchers to reinvest into equipment -- instead of replacement stock -- and still avoid paying tax on capital gain. AMT Relief: The bill allows agriculture producers to average out their incomes over a four-year period without losing those benefits to the Alternative Minimum Tax Renewable Energy Incentives: Recent legislation also extended the tax credit for electricity produced from wind and expanded the tax credit to include electricity produced from small irrigation hydropower facilities.  For further information contact the IRS at www.irs.gov or 1-800-829-1040.

January 18, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus today he said will ""fight tooth and nail"" against any attempts to cut Army and Air National Guard units, noting a rumored plan by the Defense Department to scale back units would deal a blow to national and state-side defense capabilities.    
Several news outlets, including the Boston Globe and the Wall Street Journal, have reported on a Defense Department proposal that could eliminate as many as 800 Guard positions in Montana.    
During a news conference today, Secretary of the Army Francis J. Harvey confirmed that the Department is considering adjusting the number of combat brigades in the Guard.    
""We decided that it's appropriate to adjust the number of brigade combat teams,"" Harvey told reporters. ""The baseline plan had 34.  We decided that we would make that 28.""    
Baucus said if the Defense Department were to eliminate or move a brigade combat team based in Idaho, as reported by the Baltimore Sun, Montana would lose about 800 guard positions. In a letter to Montanaâs Governor and Congressional delegation, Montana National Guard Adjutant Gen. Randy Mosley said losing those positions would cost the state $15.5 million in wages and lost benefits.    
Baucus, who traveled to New Orleans shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, called the rumored proposal to scale back Montana's Guard resources is an ""absurd and foolhardy plan that should never get legs.""    
In a Wednesday letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Baucus highlighted the important role the National Guard is playing in Iraq and highlighted the many benefits a strong Guard program has to the states, including Montana's ability to fight forest fires in the summer months.    
""The National Guard is the backbone of our armed services and troop reductions would be detrimental to the nation and to the State of Montana,"" Baucus wrote to Rumsfeld today. ""At a time when our Guard is already stretched too thinly, we should not be sacrificing manpower.""    
Baucus said a ""teamwork approach"" is needed, noting Governor Brian Schweitzer and Sen. Conrad Burns have also pledged to fight the plan.    
""We showed great teamwork in fighting to keep a flying mission in Great Falls,"" said Baucus, referring to last year's combined effort opposing a Defense Department plan to relocate the Montana Air National Guard flying mission based at Gore Hill. ""Now we need to team up again to protect our guardsmen.""

Finance Committee Slated To Vote Thurs On Major CHIP Bill
July 18, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) The national spotlight is shining on Montanas senior U.S. Senator. Max Baucus is taking the lead role in the national debate over childrens health care, shepherding a plan through Congress that will boost health insurance coverage for millions of Americas kids.    Baucus is chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Finance Committee. Hes crafted a plan with Finance Committee colleagues to renew the Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and make a historic investment in childrens health that will cut the number of uninsured children in America by more than a third over the next five years.    We are about to take a historic step forward for children in America, Baucus said. Millions of needy children across the country will get the health care they need and deserve under this plan.    CHIP, which provides health insurance to more than 14,000 low-income Montana families, will expire on Sept. 30 without congressional action.    The Senate Finance Committee will meet Thursday morning to debate and vote on the bill. Baucus expects to garner wide support for the legislation, a product of his brokered agreement with Republican and Democratic leaders on the panel.    We cant fix our nations health care problems overnight  its just too big of a bite to take at once, Baucus said. Thats why we should start with our children, and start by renewing this successful program. At the very least, lets make sure our kids have health insurance. There are too many Montana families who are one bike accident, one fall down the stairs away from bankruptcy. Thats not right.   Baucus plan, endorsed by The Washington Post, will boost funding for CHIP by $35 billion over the next five years, an amount that will provide health insurance to 3.3 million more needy children across the country.    The Finance Committee action will be the first salvo in a likely showdown between Congress and the White House over the program. Shortly after Baucus unveiled is plan Friday in Washington, President Bush vowed to veto the legislation.    Baucus plan is paid for with a 61-cent per pack increase in federal tax on cigarettes, with proportional increases for other tobacco products.   The Baucus plan will substantially increase federal CHIP funding to Montana. It will set aside $27.8 million for Montana in fiscal year 2008, up from the $15.7 million the state got in fiscal year 2007. These funds, combined with technical changes in the bill, give Montana the tools it needs to move forward with its proposed expansion of CHIP eligibility from 150 percent of poverty to 175 percent of poverty.    At 175 percent of the federal poverty level, a family of three makes about $30,000 per year.    In addition to expanding health care to more kids, the bill also provides outreach funds for rural and Native American children and streamlines the Medicaid enrollment process for children living in poverty.   In crafting the bill, Baucus worked with Montana health care providers and state officials to ensure the bill is right for Montana. He held a field hearing of the Senate Finance Committee in Billings on April 4.    Kristin Juliar, director of the Montana Office of Rural Health/Area Health Education Center, said Baucus bill will keep current coverage, expand coverage to additional children, and provide improvements to the program that will result in better coverage of vulnerable populations including pregnant women, and people with unforeseen emergencies.   This bill is critical to the continued coverage of children in Montana, and will offer access to additional children, Juliar wrote in a July 17 letter to Baucus. Montana needs this legislation. Our state has one of the highest rates of uninsured population in the nation.   After the Finance Committee approves the bill, the full Senate is expected to take up the measure this summer.  -30-

May 18, 2006
WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today urged Japanâs Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to lift his countryâs ban on U.S. beef imports.    

Koizumi is expected to visit the U.S. in June.   

Japan banned U.S. beef after a cow in Washington state tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, in December 2003. Japan lifted its two-year old ban on U.S. beef from cattle less than 20 months of age in December of 2005, but suspended imports again in January after a shipment of Japan-bound veal was found to contain a backbone that posed no risk to human health.   

Baucus is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over international trade policy. In his letter to Prime Minister Koizumi, Baucus said Japanâs decision to lift its ban on U.S. beef should be based on sound science.  

âThe scientific evidence is absolutely clear:  U.S. beef is safe,â? Baucus wrote. âAs all of Japanâs food safety and animal health concerns have been addressed, many Americans are beginning to conclude that other motivations lie behind the continuation of the ban.â?  

Baucus, also a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has been a leader in the fight against Japanâs beef ban, meeting with Japanese leaders in Japan and bringing them to Montana to see firsthand that Montana an the U.S. produce the safest, highest-quality beef in the world.  

âAs Senator from Montana, a major beef producing state, I have a particular interest in this matter,â? Baucus wrote to Koizumi today. âI personally visited Japan in 2004 to meet with your trade and agriculture ministers.  I hosted a delegation of senior Japanese officials in Montana.  And I submitted comments in Japanese to the Japanese Food Safety Commission (FSC) during its four-week public consultation period last December.â?

Senator Says 50 Chinese Purchasing Officials Will Come To Billings May 23
May 18, 2007
(Billings, MT.) - A major Chinese buying delegation will be in Billings on May 23 to survey Montana products and foster stronger business ties with Montana companies, senator Max Baucus announced today during a news conference in Billings.     
As a direct result of Baucus' recent Montana Economic Development Summit in Butte, about 50 Chinese investors and government officials will attend a ""Business Expo"" organized by Baucus at MSU-Billings, starting at 8:30 a.m. The expo will give Montana companies a chance to pitch their products to the Chinese, who will represent a wide swath of private sector officials from several industry sectors in that country.     
The visit is slightly different from other foreign delegations that have visited Montana, Baucus said, because the group includes primarily private-sector decision makers.   The Chinese delegation, which is composed of presidents and vice presidents from more than 30 Chinese companies, is designed to buy U.S. goods and services, foster investment, and strengthen economic ties. The group has been touring several U.S. cities, including a recent stop in San Francisco where the delegation inked deals worth more than $4 billion, and has changed its schedule at Baucus' request in order to visit Billings.    
""This is a great opportunity for Montana, and for Montana businesses,"" Baucus said. ""Following up on a great Jobs Summit, this expo will be a chance for Montanans to sell their world class products, which means more good-paying jobs.""    
Baucus said the Chinese are interested in buying goods and services from a host of economic sectors, including foodstuffs, agricultural, the automobile industry, electric software, IT, telecommunications, mining, oils, chemicals, transportation, tourism and construction, as well as many others.     
Baucus' office will cast a statewide net to bring Montana businesses that have corresponding interests to the table Wednesday.     
The May 23 expo will be split into two portions. During the morning, Montana businesses will make presentations to the delegation highlighting the benefits of doing business in Montana and with Montana companies. In the afternoon, Baucus' office will arrange individual one-on-one meetings between interested parties to help foster direct business relationships.  	  ""Montana is the best place in the world to do business,"" Baucus said. ""And I am happy to provide a venue for Montanans to showcase their products, and help open new markets, which will boost our economy and create more good-paying jobs.  	  Baucus was joined at the news conference by Big Sky EDA executive Joe McClure and the Billings-area Chamber of Commerce president, John Brewer.   	  ""Montana has a champion in Senator Max Baucus,"" said Joe McClure, Big Sky EDA-EDC Executive Director. ""As Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, his seniority brings our state, the city of Billings, to the global marketplace.  Economic development knows no borders, only mutual opportunity.  Thank you Senator Baucus for your commitment to growing our economy.""      	  ""This is going to be an amazing opportunity for Montana businesses,"" Brewer said. ""Chances like this don't come around every day - we have to grab hold of it and make the best pitch we can. Many thanks to Max for using his seniority to bring this high-profile delegation to Billings.""   	  Before the Economic Development Summit in Butte on April 30 and May 1, Baucus played host to ambassadors from six foreign countries on a tour of several Montana companies, including Wood's Power Grip in Laurel. Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Zhou Wenzhong, participated in the tour and attended Baucus' jobs summit.   	  The expo is free and open to the public, and Baucus is encouraging all Montana businesses to attend. To register, interested companies are asked to call 1-800-332-6106 by Tuesday at noon. To reserve exhibition space please contact James Corson in Baucus' office at (406) 657-6790.  The complete schedule of events for Wednesday's expo is attached.

October 18, 2007
(Washington D.C.)  Although he came up just shy of the two-thirds majority vote needed to override President Bushs veto, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said today the fight to provide Montanas low-income kids with health insurance is far from over.   This fight is so far from over, the fat lady isnt even warming up, Baucus said. Of course Im disappointed the House failed to override Bushs veto. But that doesnt mean were going to back down in the least. Well try and try again. It just means we need to regroup and bring more people to the table. It means we need to tweak the bill slightly while making sure it does what we need it to do  cover more uninsured kids.   As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Baucus was the Senates lead author of the Childrens Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, bill which provides health insurance to children from low-income families. The bill, which received wide support from both Democrats and Republicans as well as governors and advocacy groups, was vetoed by President Bush earlier this month.   In order to override a Presidential veto, a 2/3 vote in both the House and the Senate is needed. When the bill was voted out of each chamber, the Senate had a veto proof majority, gaining 67 votes. The House today fell short of the override by only 15 votes.   The bill, which Baucus helped broker between House and Senate leaders, would provide an additional $35 billion for CHIP over the next five years, covering and additional 3.3 million kids across the country, including 12,000 in Montana.   -30-

June 19, 2007
Washington, D.C.)  U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus today advanced a major energy tax incentive package aimed at increasing domestic production, promoting conservation, and boosting alternative energy sources such as wind and ethanol.   Baucus Finance Committee passed the energy tax incentives today. The package, which will help develop clean and green power, alternative vehicles and biofuels, and clean coal technologies, will now be considered by the full Senate this week as part of a broader energy bill.   We have to do more to address climate change, lower gas prices at the pump, and wean America off of foreign sources of energy, Baucus said. My tax incentive package will help boost greener, cleaner energy production and will help create more good-paying jobs in Montana and across the country. This is a significant victory in our efforts to become more energy independent.   Baucus measure contains a new tax credit for cellulosic ethanol production. It also has new initiatives to promote wind energy, including a new residential tax credit, and incentives for connecting rural wind facilities to the energy grid.

Senator Says Programs Stress Importance Of Healthy Diet, Lifestyle
May 19, 2006
Washington, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus has nominated three Montana programs for the national Victory Against Hunger Award.   

Baucus has nominated the St. Labre Indian School in Ashland, the Montana Office of Public Instructionâs Division of Health Enhancement and Safety, and the Missoula Community Food and Agriculture Coalition for the prestigious award.  

Award winners will receive a $1,000 grant. Applications for the grant began April 10 and go through May 31. The winners will be announced in July.   

The award is presented by the Congressional Hunger Center and only members of Congress can nominate programs. Fifteen awards will be given out across the country to groups that excel at this yearâs award theme of fighting hunger through developing local and state school meals wellness programs.  

âAll three of these programs provide valuable services to Montanans, and I am very proud to nominate them for national recognition,â? Baucus said.  

â¢           The St. Labre School was nominated for its outstanding school meal program, which is part of an all-school effort to promote healthy lifestyles. The meal program places heavy emphasis on not only serving healthy foods, but also educating students on why they should eat healthy.   

â¢           The Missoula Community Food and Agriculture Coalition is working to establish a Farms to School Program in Western Montana. This coalition works to integrate healthy, locally grown food into the public school system. In addition to providing healthy food, the coalition also educates students about the benefits of eating healthy.   

â¢           The Office of Public Instructionâs Division of Health Enhancement and Safety works to help schools develop effective wellness policies. To achieve this goal, they have a multi-faceted approach that ranges from passing legislation to training school administrators about the benefits of wellness.

Senator Says Childrenâs Health Insurance Program Vital To Montana Families

 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
February 1, 2007
(Washington D.C.) â As part of his ongoing efforts to ensure that all Montana children have quality health care, U.S. Senator Max Baucus today launched his effort to expand the valuable childrenâs health care program that provides coverage to thousands of Montana kids.   

Baucus is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over CHIP â the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program. Baucus helped write and pass CHIP in 1997. Without congressional action, CHIP will expire on September 30. Baucus said he is committed to using his position to not only renew the program but expand it to insure even more children.   

âCHIP has helped millions of families over the past decade, in Montana and across the nation,â? said Chairman Baucus at a Finance Committee hearing today. âSince 1997, the share of American children without health insurance dropped by a fifth.  For the poorest children, the uninsured rate has dropped by a third.  CHIP has made a dramatic difference. Investing in childrenâs health care is common sense.â?  

Baucus has been a fierce supporter and proponent of CHIP. Baucus noted that in Montana, more than 13,100 children are currently insured under CHIP. Nationwide, CHIP covers more that 6.2 million children.   

Baucus has also called on Montanaâs legislative leaders to expand CHIP eligibility in the state, saying he will work on the federal level to craft a program that boosts enrollment in the state.   

âStill, 37,000 children â one in every six Montana children â are uninsured,â? Baucus said.  âMany of these children live on tribal lands.  We must improve access to health coverage for uninsured children, including outreach and enrollment in Indian country.â?  

Baucusâ hearing today was the first step in working to renew CHIP. Baucus plans to hold additional hearings â including one in Montana. Baucus wants to ensure that the renewal and possible CHIP expansion is right for Montanaâs and the countryâs children.  

âProviding quality, affordable health care for our children is one of my top priorities and Iâm committed to doing all I can to make that possible,â? Baucus said.

March 1, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)- More than $700,000 is available for wildlife habitat improvement and access to public lands this year through the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Trust, U.S. Senator Max Baucus announced today.    
Baucus authored legislation in 1999 that allowed 265 cabin owners to purchase their plots at Canyon Ferry Reservoir from the Bureau of Reclamation. The bill also set up the Conservation Trust to direct proceeds from the cabin sales to non-profit groups to do habitat restoration work and acquire public land access.    
Since grants became available from the Trust in 2004, more than $760,000 have been dolled out to conservation and public lands projects. The Canyon Ferry cabin sales, including interest, have generated nearly $19 million for the Trust, Baucus announced today.    
Baucus said the Trust began accepting proposals for 2006 on February 20. Applications must be postmarked no later than April 7, 2006.    
""We're an outdoors people,"" said Baucus, a Helena native. ""We hunt, we fish, we take our kids camping and hiking. We're just starting to see how important this Trust will be to boosting wildlife habitat and our access to public lands. Iâm very proud of all the folks who helped make this happen.""    
Eligible projects must restore and conserve fisheries, wildlife habitat, enhance public hunting, fishing and recreation opportunities and improve public access to public lands. While projects will be awarded statewide, at least half of the awards must go to projects located in the Upper Missouri River Corridor, generally between Holter Lake and the town of Three Forks, Baucus said.    
""Thanks to Maxâs efforts, the joint trust will make available $710,000 in grants for projects that restore and conserve fisheries, wildlife and improve access to public lands. This grant money is a huge boost to recreationalists in our state,"" stated Bill Orsello, a hunter and the Chair of the Citizens Advisory Board which makes recommendations to the MFWCT.    
Baucus said completed projects funded by the Trust include: acquiring about 20 acres for public access in the Helena National Forest on Crow Creek, near the town of Radersberg; acquiring about 20.5 acres on Whitehorse Creek, west of Townsend; helping acquire 235 acres near Winston, in the Elkhorn Mountains between Helena and Townsend; and acquiring about 71 acres for the Black Bridge Recreation Area near Glendive, to provide fishing access to the Yellowstone River.    
""I am really proud of our Canyon Ferry bill because it let cabin owners purchase their lands and it set up this program to boost hunting and fishing in Montana,"" Baucus said. ""That's a big win for everyone. This just goes to show what we can accomplish by working together.""    
For further information or to apply for grant funds, people are asked to contact the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Trust:

September 1, 2005
(Washington, D.C.) â News reports from Capitol Hill today say Congress may be called into session early to approve emergency relief for victims of Hurricane Katrina.  
Montana Senator Max Baucus said heâs on hand in the nationâs capitol and prepared to support the aid package, which is likely to provide $10 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for relief efforts.  
âWhen disaster hits, we as Americans come to the aid of our friends and neighbors,â? Baucus said. âThatâs just the right thing to do.â?  
Congress has been in recess for the month of August and was expected to reconvene after the Labor Day holiday, on Tuesday, September 6. Timing on when the House and Senate will vote on the aid package wasnât immediately clear Thursday.  
Baucus spent most of the summer recess traveling Montana and meeting with his constituents. He returned to Capitol Hill for planning meetings in advance of the Senate returning Tuesday.

Senator Announces Plan To Fund Secure Rural Schools Program Without Selling Public Lands
March 20, 2007
(Washington D.C.) - Montana counties could get a $65-million increase in payments from the federal government under a proposal announced today by Montana's Senator Max Baucus, one of the Senate's most ardent opponents of a Bush Administration proposal to sell of public lands to pay for the Secure Rural Schools program.     
The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act, commonly known as the county payments program, expired at the end of last year. Without Congressional action, 34 Montana counties stand to lose millions in lost payments. The program compensates counties for lost tax-revenue to federal lands, funds that are used to pay for education, road construction, and emergency services. The Bush Administration had proposed selling of as many as 300,000 acres to renew the program, a move that was met with grave resistance in Western states like Montana.     
Baucus today joined Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in announcing the new proposal, which will have to be included in a supplemental spending bill in the Senate next week. The proposal could change the formula used to distribute funds across the nation in a way that's more fair to all states. Currently, three states - Cal., Ore., and Wash. - receive 75 percent of the total amount available in the program.     
Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over taxes, helped broker the agreement by developing a solution to pay for the program that neither sells public lands nor drives the nation deeper into debt.     
Under the proposal announced today, Montana's share of funding could spike by an estimated $65 million starting in fiscal year 2007 through 2011, for an overall total of as much as $150 million to Montana counties. (see attached spreadsheet.)     
""Our bill will fully fund the rural schools program without selling even one acre of our prized public lands,"" Baucus said. ""Our public lands shouldn't be put up for sale to the highest bidder. The Administration challenged congress to find a way to fund this program and we did. Montana counties will get a real shot in the arm under this program. That's something that will help boost Main Streets across our state.""      ""We have crafted a lifeboat to keep rural communities afloat,"" Senator Wyden said.  ""It couldn't come at a more critical time.""     
Montana County Commissioners Applaud Move:     
""Secure Rural Schools is extremely important to Ravalli and all western Montana and we are very grateful to Senator Baucus for working hard to make sure that the program is funded,"" said Alan Thompson, Ravalli County Commissioner.    
""Secure Rural Schools program is critical to Beaverhead county, and to take a cut to this funding would make many departments almost go away, and we appreciate Max's work for our small rural communities,"" Mike McGinley, Beaverhead County Commissioner and second Vice President of MACO.    
""Secure Rural Schools is vital to the Flathead County, and my colleague Commissioner Gary Hall has been working hard to get this funding. We appreciate all of Max Baucus' work to secure these much need dollars,"" said Joe Brenneman, Flathead Valley Commissioner.    
""Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely vital to our Montana counties, and I want to thank Max Baucus for all his efforts to secure funding for this program,"" said Yellowstone County Commissioner Bill Kennedy, Chairman of the Rural Action Caucus for the National Association of Counties.      
Here are the Montana counties who qualify for funding: Beaverhead, Broadwater, Carbon, Carter, Cascade, Chouteau, Deer Lodge, Fergus, Flathead, Gallatin, Glacier, Golden Valley, Granite, Jefferson, Judith Basin, Lake, Lewis & Clark, Lincoln, Madison, Meagher, Mineral, Missoula, Park, Pondera, Powder River, Powell, Ravalli, Rosebud, Sanders, Silver Bow, Stillwater, Sweet Grass, Teton, and Wheatland.

October 20, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  Congress has approved Montana Senator Max Baucus bill that would help curb the rising number of Montanans without health insurance and provide health coverage for those with serious or pre-existing health conditions. Baucus teamed up with Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) to write the State High Risk Pool Extension Act, aimed at extending a grant program for state high-risk pools, funds used to help residents who can't get affordable health insurance because of serious or pre-existing conditions. The grant program expired on September 30, 2004.  The bill, which will direct up to $1.6 million to Montana in fiscal year 2006, passed the House in July and unanimously in the Senate Wednesday. The bill now goes to President Bush for his expected signature.  This bill is about providing quality, affordable health care to Montanans who otherwise couldnt afford it, Baucus said, noting one in five Montanans doesn't have health insurance. The rising cost of health care can be the straw that breaks the camels back for many of Montanas working families. High risk pools are one way we can help. 
Operated by states, high-risk pools help individuals who are unable to obtain insurance because of existing medical conditions. Currently, about 20 states have high-risk pools or are in the process of creating them. The bill authorizes $15 million for 2005 and 2006 for states establishing new high-risk pools. It would extend and boost funding for states that already have risk pools by authorizing $75 million in operating grants for 2006 to 2010. Baucus said Montana could use the funding to either enroll more people into the program or reduce costs for current participants. The measure would build upon a grant program Baucus helped create as part of the major international trade bill of 2002. (As then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus was chief author of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act.) The grant-based program directed $638,228 to Montanas high-risk pool in 2003, funds that helped provide health care to 3,123 Montanans.  Its one of my top priorities to make sure that all Montanans have access to quality, affordable health care, said Baucus, the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Once the president signs this bill, which we expect him to do, more Montanans will have access to the quality health care they need and deserve.

September 20, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus announced   today he will vote to confirm President Bushs pick for Chief Justice of the   U.S. Supreme Court. 
After reviewing Judge John   Roberts credentials and meeting with him privately, I have found that he meets   my criteria for judges. And that is: only the brightest, most objective minds   shall serve on the bench, said Baucus, who acknowledged the decision was not an   easy one. I call 'em as I see them, he said.   Judge Roberts indicated to me personally that he has a healthy respect for   precedent and the hard-won rights of Americans. My only yardstick or litmus   test is whether or not Judge Roberts is right for Montana and America. Ive determined that he is. Baucus met privately with Roberts in   his Washington, D.C., office in July and followed closely last   weeks Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.  
Throughout my career, Ive always   tried to reach across party lines to do whats right, Baucus said. This isnt   about being a Democrat or Republican; its about being a Montanan and American. The Senate is likely to vote on the   Roberts nomination next week.

Senator Says Trust Fund Is Critical For Montana Wool Growers
August 21, 2006
(Polson)- Senator Max Baucus today lauded the two-year extension of the Wool Research, Development, and Promotion Trust Fund â the Wool Trust Fund â included as part of the pensions bill signed by President Bush last Thursday.  

âIâm glad we were able to agree to get this done,â? Baucus said.  âThe Wool Trust Fund is so important to Montana wool growers.  Iâve been looking for an opportunity to extend this program.  When I saw that we could do this in the pensions bill, I jumped at the chance to help this important Montana industry.â?  

The Wool Trust Fund provides funding for increasing the competitiveness of American wool through innovative research and marketing promotion.  The Fund has supported breakthrough research into wool fabrics used by the U.S. military and commercial customers, including enzyme treatment for washable wool clothing and new fire retardant wool fabrics.  It has also been crucial to the aggressive marketing of American wool.  Before establishment of the Fund, only 10 percent of domestically produced raw wool found its way to export markets.  Today, approximately 60 percent of U.S. raw wool is exported.  

âWe need to help Montanaâs exporters take advantage of the competitive opportunities out there,â? said Baucus.  âThe Wool Trust Fund has been critical to helping all aspects of the wool industry, especially in Montana, compete and win in the international marketplace.â?  
Baucus, who serves as the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, was integrally involved in the negotiations on the pensions bill.  Baucus helped establish the program in 2000 and first got it extended in 2004.  The current program expires at the end of 2007, but under the provision Baucus inserted into the pensions bill today, the program is set to last until the end of 2009.  

Aeric Reilly, Executive Secretary of the Montana Wool Growers Association in Helena, said he was âthrilled at the news.â?  He added, âMy hatâs off to Max for coming through for Montana yet again.  The Wool Trust Fund has been a real boon for Montana wool growers.  Itâs allowed us to increase production of wool and find new markets, both overseas and here at home with the U.S. military.  I really want to thank Max for fighting for Montana wool growers.â?  

Montana is the sixth largest lamb and wool producer in the United States with 300,000 sheep.  The state produces nearly 2.5 million pounds of wool annually with a very strong pool and cooperative marketing system for wool producers.  

âThe American Sheep Industry Association appreciates the leadership of Senator Baucus with the extension of the Wool Trust programming to benefit sheep producers in Montana and nationwide,â? said Peter Orwick, Executive Director of the American Sheep Industry Association.  âContinuation of the Wool Trust Fund helps sheep producers in Montana and across the United States to expand wool product development and sales of American wool to companies across the globe.â?

February 21, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  To accommodate more people, Montana Senator Max Baucus has changed the location of his public meeting in Missoula to discuss President Bushs proposal to sell public lands. 
The meeting, earlier planned for the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, will now be held at the Missoula Childrens Theater, 200 N. Adams. The time of the meeting remains the same  Thursday, February 23, at 10:30 a.m. The meeting is designed to gather local input on a new public lands proposal contained in the Bush Administrations fiscal year 2007 budget request to Congress that would sell off more than 300,000 acres of public lands. Baucus has been critical of the proposal, which would sell about 14,000 acres of public land in Montana to pay for the Secure Rural Schools Act, which provides payments to counties with a federal presence. Baucus supports extending the program, which he helped establish in 2000, but not by selling off public lands to do so, he said. The Rural Schools program is set to expire or sunset this year. Baucus has co-sponsored legislation to extend the program for seven more years without selling public lands. Baucus is inviting a wide array of groups and individuals to the meeting, which is free and open to the public. For more information, people are asked to contact Senator Baucus Missoula office at 406-329-3123.

Senator Wants To Work Together To Insure More Montana Kids

 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
February 21, 2007
(HELENA, Mont.) - Montana Senator Max Baucus wants to make a deal with the state legislature to provide more Montana children with health insurance.     

Striking a theme of working together and cooperation, Baucus on Wednesday challenged the Montana Legislature to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, saying he'll use his powerful committee chairmanship in Washington to expand the program nationally.     

""I'll provide dollars in Washington, if you expand CHIP here at home,"" Baucus told both the House and Senate. ""Call it a 'fair deal.' Call it a 'square deal.' Call it whatever you like. But let's expand CHIP so Montana parents don't have to lay awake at night worrying about their kids.""     

Baucus helped craft CHIP in 1997 and then lobbied state officials to sign on to the program. Without Congressional action, the program will expire on September 30 of this year.     

Baucus is the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over many of the nation's health care programs, including CHIP. He said renewing and expanding the CHIP program is his top health care priority for the committee this year, ""it's Number 1.""     

CHIP is the federal and state matching program that currently provides health insurance to more than 13,000 Montana kids from families of modest means.     

The Legislature is considering raising the eligibility level for CHIP, a move that would enable even more Montana families to enroll in the program.        

Baucus, speaking to a joint session of the 60th Montana Legislative Assembly, called creating CHIP one of the most significant accomplishments of his career and said CHIP has become the ""most successful children's health program in history.""     

He said more than 40,000 Montana kids have been helped by CHIP since it was first enacted.    

""Why is CHIP so important?"" Baucus asked. ""Think for a minute about people who can barely afford to heat their homes or feed their kids - let alone pay for health care. That's what CHIP does for them. It makes sure their kids - at least their kids - get coverage.""     

Baucus applauded state officials and legislators for pushing to insure more Montanans, noting strides have been made, but said Montana still has more than 37,000 kids without health insurance.     

""That means 37,000 Montana families are teetering on the edge,"" Baucus said. ""One bike accident, a fall down the stairs, an injury on the basketball court could drive them into bankruptcy. Or worse. That's just wrong.""        

Throughout his speech, Baucus, who served in the State House as a Representative from Missoula in 1973, stressed the importance of setting aside partisan differences and working together.     

""It was in this chamber that I learned the value of working together,"" Baucus said. ""It was here where I learned that partisanship doesn't serve the noble purpose of legislating. I learned that digging in your heels and fighting with each other doesn't help make Montanans' lives any better. Remember, nothing of consequence ever happens unless people work together. A partisan victory never lasts...a compromise is more durable.""

July 21, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus today introduced a bill to expand the federal program that helps workers who lose their jobs because of international trade agreements. 
The measure, sponsored by Baucus and Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., would expand the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and make it easier for industries, such as timber companies in Montana, to qualify for direct assistance from the federal government.  For more than 40 years, TAA has been providing retraining, income support, and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs due to trade. In the Trade Act of 2002, Baucus spearheaded the most comprehensive expansion and overhaul of the TAA program since 1974.  Baucus said many workers in Montana have benefited from the TAA program, including workers at the aluminum plant in Columbia Falls.  TAA is an important way to make sure free trade is fair to everyone, Baucus said. Montana has benefited, on the whole, from free trade agreements. But we need to have fallback programs to help our workers if trade hurts them. Baucus said the softwood lumber industry in Canada has hurt small timber mills in Montana. His bill will help make sure people who lose their jobs at timber mills can more easily get the TAA benefits they need and deserve. The Baucus-Coleman bill, called the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Industries Act, would cut red tape out of the process. Baucus said some workers who lose their jobs in industries such as textiles, small electronics, and lumber get the TAA benefits they deserve, while others just down the street may not. His bill will streamline the process.  
Maintaining a well-trained workforce is key to our nations long-term competitiveness and economic health, Baucus said. TAA is a safety net catching those few who lose out from our trade policy choices. This legislation will cut through the red tape so deserving workers face less uncertainty and can be enrolled and retrained sooner.  The following Montana companies have benefited from the TAA program:  Don Pluid Logging, Eureka  Stillwater Forest Products, Kalispell  Owens and Hurst Lumber, Eureka 
Jore Corporation, Ronan  Bayer Pharmaceuticals (multiple locations)  Louisiana Pacific, Belgrade  Columbia Falls Aluminum  Trout Creek Lumber, Thompson Falls  Flying J Oil  Gas, Sidney  Stimson Lumber, Libby  Ultrafem, Missoula

Senator, Others Unveil Legislation To Encourage Japan To Start Taking Safest, World-class Beef
June 21, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus today helped introduce legislation to impose economic sanctions on Japan if that country doesnât lift its ban on U.S. beef imports.   

At a press conference on Capitol Hill, Baucus, wearing a large button that reads âI have a beef with Japanâ? fully threw his support behind legislation authored by Senators Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) that would require the Treasury Secretary to impose tariffs on Japanese imports if Japan does not lift its ban by August 31. The tariffs are equal to $3.14 billion annually â roughly the amount U.S. beef exporters lose each year by being shut out of the Japanese market. The sanctions would go into effect on September 30, 2006 if Japan is not taking U.S. beef by that time.  

In related news, late Tuesday, U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators agreed that Japan will inspect 35 meatpacking plants eligible to export beef to that country. The move could lead to Japan accepting U.S. beef from cattle 20 months and under of age.  

Baucus welcomed the agreement in principle, but said the legislation introduced today is needed to maintain leverage with Japan.   

âJapan is a friend, but I have a beef with Japan,â? Baucus said at the press conference today. âIt is long overdue that Japan start taking U.S. beef. Montana and U.S. beef is the safest, highest-quality in the world â itâs time Japan lived up to its end of the deal.â?  

Japan banned U.S. beef after a cow in Washington state tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, in December 2003. Japan lifted its two-year old ban on U.S. beef from cattle 20 months of age and under in December of 2005, but suspended imports again in January after a shipment of Japan-bound veal was found to contain a backbone that posed no risk to human health. As a result of Japanâs ban on U.S. beef, American producers have lost $3.14 billion annually.  

Baucus is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over international trade policy and has been leading the charge to get bans on U.S. beef lifted. Baucus has met with top Japanese officials and traveled to Japan. Baucus also invited senior Japanese officials to Montana and during their Montana visit, he served Montana beef.   

Baucus has also urged Prime Minister Koizumi to lift Japanâs ânon-science based banâ? on U.S. beef.  

âIn my experience, the only thing that really gets the Japanese to change is leverage,â? Baucus said. âI do not want to find out later that this deal was meant to keep Congress at bay while Prime Minister Koizumi visits Washington next week and then when Koizumi returns to Japan itâs business as usual. It wonât be business as usual until Montana beef is on dinner tables in Japan.â?  

Baucus is also a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.  

The legislation has broad support from both Republicans and Democrats and will be offered to the Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill tomorrow.

September 21, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  Montana Senator Max Baucus is   offering an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 agriculture spending bill that   would boost funds for food assistance to Hurricane Katrina victims while pumping   an additional $1.5 million to Montana food banks. 
Baucus provision would direct $200   million to the Emergency Food Assistance Program to help food banks, food   pantries, and other charity organizations provide assistance to Hurricane   Katrina victims.  His provision will also provide $251   million in grants to states -- including $1.5 million for Montana -- to replenish   food assistance programs.  Its clear we need to boost our   efforts to help Katrina victims, Baucus said. But in doing so, we need to make   sure our Montana food banks arent hurt in the process.   Thats why Im pushing to provide an additional $1 million for Montana food programs. These programs are administered by   the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Senate is currently working on the   agencys fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill. A vote on Baucus measure could   come by weeks end, he said.  
Aaron Brock, outreach coordinator   for the Missoula Food Bank, said additional dollars are needed and will be put   to good use. Were seeing an increased need all   the time and Hurricane Katrina may increase those needs, Brock said. Any   additional funding will be put to good use and help feed hungry people in   Montana and in Missoula. Were grateful to Senator Baucus for   thinking about anti-hunger agencies here. Baucus is a senior member of the   Senates Agriculture Committee and the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senates   Finance Committee.

September 21, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  During a daylong meeting on Capitol   Hill, Montanas senior Senator Max Baucus and other   today strategized on the future of the nations nuclear missile   force. Over the next several weeks, Defense   Secretary Donald Rumsfeld will begin what is known as the Quadrennial Defense   Review, a process in which the Department of Defense undergoes a top-to-bottom   review of its war-fighting ability. According to reports, the DOD is considering   possible changes to the nations Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles force,   including reducing the number of nuclear-armed missiles. Baucus noted that   Montana is home to 40 percent of the nations   ICBMs  housing 200 at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great   Falls. The ICBMs should stay at Malmstrom    its that simple, Baucus said. Keeping the ICBMs at Malmstrom is about   keeping good-paying jobs in our state. Its also about ensuring Montana plays a strong   role in our nations defense and military future. 
Baucus and other members of the ICBM   Coalition, senators from other states that house ICBMs, met with top Air Force   and DOD leaders about the future of nuclear deterrence, ICBMs, and U.S.   strategic forces. Baucus and others today also sent   letters to Secretary Rumsfeld and Senate Defense Committee leaders, urging them   to carefully examine QDR recommendations and noting that maintaining the 500   ICBM missile force had a powerful dissuasive effect on potential   adversaries. In combination with the other legs   of the traditional triad, a 500 missile force of nuclear ICBMs has a powerful   dissuasive effect on potential adversaries, Baucus and others wrote. The   continuing value or these forces has been affirmed by the Nuclear Posture   Reviews and other studies, including the 2002 NPRs embedding of these forces in   the New Triad. We must maintain force levels more than sufficient to dissuade   any potential adversary from pursuing parity with our forces. This dissuasive   capability also helps to reduce the risk of regional arms races that could force   our non-nuclear friends and allies to develop nuclear capabilities of their   own. Baucus said that the QDR is in its   final stages and is expected to be presented to Congress in February 2006, once   President Bush outlines his fiscal year 2007 budget.

February 22, 2006
(BUTTE) - Montana Senator Max Baucus today criticized the Administration's plan to allow a state-owned business in the United Arab Emirates to take over operations at six major U.S. sea ports, saying he'll back legislation to slow the deal despite a veto threat by the President.    
""I am very concerned about handing over operation of our ports to Dubai Ports World.  We need to further investigate the potential security risks this could raise. Obviously our number one priority is keeping America safe, and that has to be our litmus test for whether or not this is a good idea,"" Baucus said.    
Baucus said today he'll back legislation, likely offered by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), that would put a moratorium on the deal until more information can be gathered.    
The pending sale would put Dubai Ports World in charge of major shipping operations in New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, New Orleans, Miami and Philadelphia.    
""We need to slow this whole thing down and gather more information,"" Baucus said. ""Our seaports are a critical line of defense when it comes to protecting our homeland.  That's why we need to stop this particular deal until we have more assurances that it won't impact port security in any way.""

January 22, 2007
Montana Senator Max Baucus today honored Les Skramstad, a Libby man who died Sunday morning from exposure to asbestos. Baucus delivered a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. His remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below.      

Honoring Les Skramstad     

January 22, 2007    

U.S. Senator Max Baucus    

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Montanan who died Saturday night at his home in Libby, Montana. Libby is a small town up in the northwest corner of my state.     

Les Skramstad was not only an outspoken advocate for his town, which was horribly wronged at the hands of W.R. Grace, but he was also my friend.     

I first met Les in Libby in the year 2000, shortly after news reports attributed hundreds of deaths to asbestos exposure from decades of vermiculite mining there.     

We sat down in Gayla Benefieldâs living room. There were about 25 people who were very ill. Over huckleberry pie and coffee, the group explained to me the horrific legacy Grace had left behind. And although I had read the reports and briefing papers on the situation, that was the first time I had seen asbestos exposure up close. And, Mr. President, it was gut-wrenching. Iâll never forget it â as long as I live.     

They opened their hearts and poured out unimaginable stories of suffering and tragedy. I was absolutely stunned. It was at the moment that I vowed to myself that Iâll do whatever it takes to help Libby become whole again.     

Entire families -- fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sons and daughters are all sick. Hundreds are dead.  They are bound together by one thing: their exposure to tremolite asbestos, mined by W.R. Grace.      

That night at Gaylaâs, when I first met Les, he watched me closely all evening. He was wary and came up to me after his friends and neighbors had finished speaking.     

Les said to me, âSenator, a lot of people have come to Libby and told us they would help, then they leave and we never hear from them again.â?    

âMax,â? he said, âplease, as a man like me -- as someone's father too, as someone's husband, as someone's son, help me. Help us. Help us make this town safe for Libby's sons and daughters not even born yet.â?    

Les worked at the vermiculite mine starting in 1959. He told me about the dust he swept every day -- off of three separate floors at the mine.  And although company officials said the dust was harmless, thatâs what ultimately took his life. And that dust is what has made his wife and children sick, too.     

You see, Mr. President, that dust was laden with tremolite asbestos fibers.  When he got home, heâd hug his wife. His kids would jump up in his lap.     

 I think he was less worried about his own fate. It was as if Les had accepted that he was going to die. But the thing that got to him most was that he brought that dust home with him. He wanted justice for his family and friends.     

That night I told him I would do all that I could. That I wouldn't back down. That I wouldn't give up.     

Les accepted my offer and then pointed his finger and said to me, âI'll be watching Senator.â?     

And he did.     

Over the years Les and I worked together to help Libby. We became friends in the process. I counted on seeing him every time I went to Libby. Iâve been up to Libby almost 20 times since then. I talked to Les on the phone. I visited him in the hospital.     

Les is my inspiration in the fight to get Libby a clean bill of health and justice for its residents. He is the face of hundreds and thousands of sick and exposed folks in this tiny Montana community.     

Les -- working with others in the community -- became an outspoken advocate for Libby. He put a personal face on asbestos contamination. He provided a straightforward look into the lives of people hurt by Grace and the poisonous asbestos fibers they left behind. Les was a true Western Gentleman. And he was very effective.      

Itâs been 8 years since this tragedy first came to light. Weâve made a lot of progress in Libby.     

â¢           We launched the Center for Asbestos Related Diseases, which has screened and provided health care to thousands of Libby residents.     
â¢           We kicked the EPA into gear and got Libby listed as a national Supefund site.    
â¢           We secured millions for cleanup, health care, and economic development in Libby.    

But, sadly, Mr. President there is still much more do to. Much more. Libby residents deserve compensation for their injuries. They deserve health care. They deserve to see those responsible go to prison for what they did. They deserve to know that their town is clean of asbestos.     

What I knew about Les makes this news very sad to me personally. Iâm sad for his family. Iâm sad for his friends. Iâm sad for Libby.     

Mr. President, Iâm also angry. Iâm angry at W.R. Grace, which knowingly poisoned its workers. Iâm angry that justice still has not been done in Libby. Iâm angry that we havenât been able to do more.    

But we wonât give up. Weâll keep fighting for Les and Libby. Lesâ passing only furthers my resolve to try harder. To do more. We wonât let up. We will not stop.     

When I get tired, I think of Les. And I can't shake what he asked me to do. In all of my years as an elected official, helping Libby is among the most personally compelling things Iâve ever been called on to do.    

Iâll keep the promise I made to Les that night at Gaylaâs house.     

Les was a fighter to the end. He recently minced no words about his feelings toward Grace.     

He told the Missoulian newspaper, quote: ""There's not a doubt in my mind that [they] are guilty of murder.""     

""I started in 1959 and I was as healthy as a horse,â? he said. âI knew all the guys that worked there, 135 employees when I was there. And there's five of us left alive. Five. The rest of them are gone.""    

Now, sadly, so is Les.    

The Book of Proverbs says:  ârighteousness delivers from death.â?  And if that is true, then Les will certainly be delivered.    

My prayers are with Lesâ wife Norita, his family and friends, and the people of Libby.     

Mr. President, I yield the floor.

March 22, 2007
Washington, D.C.) - Montana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, today called on Congress to renew and fully fund the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which provides health care services to Indians all across the country.    
The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over many of the nation's health care and child welfare programs. Baucus held a hearing in his committee today and said renewing IHCIA would be a priority this year, expressing frustration that the act hasn't been renewed since 1994.     
Baucus also wants to ensure that changes to Indian health care and child welfare programs work for tribes in Montana. That's why he invited Carl E. Venne to testify before the committee. Venne is Chairman of the Crow Tribe of Indians in Montana, as well as Chairman of the Montana -Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council.     
""Our Tribal members suffer from disproportionately higher rates of chronic disease and other illnesses,"" said Chairman Venne.  ""Native Americans have the highest rates of diabetes, heart disease, suicide, and several types of cancer of all other groups in the United States. While the federal government's mission statement for American Indian health care has lofty objectives, in reality the Indian Health Services is unable to deliver health care that is even remotely comparable to the health care available to other Americans.""      
In 1976, Congress passed Indian Health Care Improvement Act or IHCIA, which provides Native Americans with access to affordable health care, however it has not been renewed and many people are not getting the health care services they need and deserve, Baucus said.      
""For the last 13 years, we have seen Congress fail to reauthorize the law,"" Baucus said at today's hearing. ""As a result, the current funding level for the Indian Health Service system is only 52 to 60 percent of the need.  That means that in any given year, by the month of June, the only patients who can receive treatment in Indian Health Service hospitals are those with conditions that ""threaten life or limb. That's not right and I'm committed to doing something about it""     
Baucus also noted that methamphetamine is having a huge impact on the children welfare system in Indian Country and plans to work on ways to help stamp out meth in tribal communities.    
Baucus expects the Finance Committee to consider IHCIA legislation related to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP this spring.       
""Last year, Congress came close to reauthorizing IHCIA. This year, let us complete the job,"" Baucus said. ""Let us act like a nation great in riches and power.  And let us fulfill our health-care promises to the first Americans and to their children.""

Senator Says Administration Must Support Pay Increase

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
May 22, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - News that the White House is opposing a pay increase for the nation's military personnel compelled Montana's Senator Max Baucus to lash out at the Administration on the Senate floor today.      
""Of the billions of dollars that we spend on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it would seem absurd to oppose this small pay bump,"" Baucus said. ""But that is exactly what the Administration is doing.""     
Baucus cited a recent  Boston Globe  report that said the White House is ""trying to kill a Democratic plan to increase the size of a military pay raise next year, contending it would be too costly and that members of the armed forces are already sufficiently compensated.""    
Baucus said the House Defense Authorization bill includes a one half of one percent increase in military pay above the President's request. For the average new enlistee, this will amount to about $75 per year in extra pay, Baucus said.     
Baucus said the extra dollars could help provide school clothes for soldiers' kids, a family trip to the ballgame, or help with the high cost of gasoline.      
Baucus said salaries for new enlistees start at $15,617 per year, an amount that makes new enlistees with three or more dependents eligible for food stamps.     
""Among the sacrifices we ask of our men and women in harm's way, going hungry shouldn't be one of them,"" Baucus said.     
In a May 17 letter to the House Armed Services Committee, the President's Budget Director said the pay increase is ""unnecessary."" The same letter also expressed the Bush Administration's opposition to a $40-per-month increase for the widows of slain soldiers.    
""Again, this is a modest bump in benefits, and pales in comparison to the sacrifice that these families have made,"" Baucus said.     
""I am asking the Administration to reconsider their opposition to the pay increase and additional survivor benefit,"" Baucus said. ""Supporting our troops is something we can all agree on.""     
Baucus' floor speech is attached.     
 Floor Statement of Senator Max Baucus    
            Mr. President, I rise today in support of our troops.    
There are few things as important as the gift of one's labor, love, and life.      
            Our soldiers are asked to make generous sacrifices of these precious commodities every day.     
            Our finest young soldiers work 19 hour days in hot, dry, and dangerous places like Fallujah and Kabul.   They do so because they have a deep love of country. Many of our soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice with their lives.     
              Increasingly we are asking more and more of our soldiers on the front line. In April, Secretary Gates announced that he is extending the tours of duty for active duty soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from 12 to 15 months.     
Our troops have already accomplished so much. Deposed Saddam Hussein. Toppled the Taliban. And responded to the threats posed by vicious terrorist around the world.     
Our troops have done everything we have asked of them.     
I was disappointed therefore, when I came across a newspaper article this weekend noting that the Administration opposes a modest pay raise for American soldiers.     
The House Defense Authorization bill includes a one half of one percent increase in military pay above the President's request. For the average new enlistee, this will amount to roughly $75 per year in extra pay. School clothes for the kids. A family trip to the ball game. A few tanks of gas, with the prices we're stuck paying.     
The increase is aimed at reducing the gap in pay between comparable military and civilian jobs that stands at about 3.9 percent today. Even after the proposed increases, the gap will still remain at 1.4 percent.    

Of the billions of dollars that we spend on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it would seem absurd to oppose this small pay bump. But that is exactly what the Administration is doing.     
In a May 17th, 2007 letter to the House Armed Services Committee, the President's Budget Director announced that the pay increase included in the House bill is ""unnecessary.""    
Mr. President, I believe it is necessary to anything we can to provide for the welfare of our fighting men and women.     
Salaries for newly minted enlistees start at $15,617 dollars per year. To put this in perspective, new enlistees with three or more dependents are eligible for food stamps.     
Among the sacrifices we ask of our men and women in harm's way, going hungry shouldn't be one of them.     
What's more, in addition to opposing the pay bump for soldiers, the Administration letter also announces that they oppose a $40 per month increase in allowances for the widows of slain soldiers.     
Again, this is a modest bump in benefits, and pales in comparison to the sacrifice that these families have made. $40 dollars per month extra won't make it any easier to face another day without a loved one who is lost. But it can help pay the rent. Keep the heat on. And relieve a bit of stress for families facing a new world without their spouse.     
That is why I am asking the Administration to reconsider their opposition to the pay increase and additional survivor benefit. Supporting our troops is something we can all agree on. Republicans and Democrats.     
Mr. President I ask that you reconsider your opposition to increase pay for our soldiers and aid for this war's widows. We may not all agree on what we should do in Iraq going forward, but I believe we can and should reach a simple accommodation on troop pay.    
I yield the floor.

April 23, 2007
(Washington D.C.) Montana Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester still have a beef with Japan, because of an unfair beef ban, but they are hoping a ""taste test"" by the Japanese Prime Minister this week will help change that.    
In a letter to the White House Chef Cristeta Comerford, the senators urged that Montana steaks be served when Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has an official dinner with President George Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. The senators say that serving Montana beef could help end Japan's ban.     
""We could give the Japanese thousands of scientific tests showing that Montana has the safest, highest quality beef in the world,"" Baucus said. ""But sometimes there's no substitute for a good old fashioned taste test.""    
""There are lots of dinner choices in Washington, but nothing beats a big, red, juicy steak from back home,"" Tester said.  ""Prime Minister Abe is in for a real treat.  So are millions of Japanese, as soon as this ban is lifted.""    
Japan banned U.S. beef in 2003, after a cow in Washington state tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.  Japan resumed shipments of U.S. beef from cattle 20 months of age or younger in July 2006, but international health standards certify the safety of all U.S. beef, bone-in and boneless, regardless of age.     
In addition to fighting Japan's beef ban, Baucus and Tester have also lead the fight to open other foreign markets for Montana beef including South Korea and China.

January 23, 2007
(Washington D.C.) --  After attending President Bushâs State of the Union Address tonight on Capitol Hill, Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus said he agreed with many of the themes in the speech, including the importance of health care and energy independence, but said the presidentâs approach to Iraq is misguided.     Baucus is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over many of the nationâs health care programs. In reaction to Bushâs proposals on health care, Baucus said he will examine them closely in the coming weeks and months.     
âThe President is right to recognize that we have to start reforming health care now,â? Baucus said. âWith one in five Montanans without health insurance, we have a big problem on our hands. To get off the ground, his proposals need to do two things: provide new health coverage to people who have none, and better coverage to those who donât have enough.      âWe canât just rearrange the chairs on the deck of our sinking health care system,â? Baucus said. âAnd we can't be careless with the safety net on which millions of Americans currently rely.  In the coming weeks I will move aggressively to renew and expand childrenâs health care coverage through the CHIP program, and Iâll explore pooling arrangements that may extend health coverage to even more Americans. Above all, Iâm committed to working together to do whatâs right for Montanaâs health care needs.â?    
Baucus also welcomed President Bushâs statements on the need for America to be more energy independent, saying he will work as Finance Committee Chairman to pass tax incentives to spur renewable energy sources.     
âI was glad to hear him talk about energy,â? Baucus said. âWe have to do more to wean ourselves off of foreign sources of energy. I want to see more domestic production, conservation, and a big push for renewable sources like wind and ethanol.â?     
Finally, Baucus said he respectfully disagrees with President Bushâs proposal to send more troops into Iraq, saying American troops have performed admirably but that itâs time to start bringing them home.     
âI just think thatâs a mistake,â? Baucus said. âThrowing more combat troops at the problem is not the solution. The current strategy isnât working. We need to shift toward a diplomatic solution, one that will bring our men and women home as soon as possible.â?     
Baucus also reiterated his commitment to working together with Sen. Jon Tester, Rep. Denny Rehberg, and Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer to move the state forward.    
âIt all comes down to working together,â? Baucus said. âThatâs my top priority: working together to do whatâs right for Montana.â?

May 23, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - Live from his Senate office in Washington, D.C., Montana's senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today welcomed a Chinese buying delegation to Billings, saying the Treasure State is a solid place to do business.        
As a direct result of Baucus' recent Montana Economic Development Summit in Butte, more than 40 Chinese investors and government officials today attended a   ""Business Expo"" organized by Baucus at MSU-Billings. The expo gave Montana companies a chance to pitch their products to the Chinese, who represented a wide swath of private sector officials from several industry sectors in that country.     
The visit was the first of its kind in Montana's history, Baucus said. And it was slightly different from other foreign delegations that have visited Montana, because the group includes primarily private-sector decision makers.    
The Chinese delegation, which is composed of government and private sector senior management, is designed to buy U.S. goods and services, foster investment, and strengthen economic ties. The group has been touring several U.S. cities, including a recent stop in San Francisco, where the delegation inked deals worth more than $4 billion. The group changed its schedule at Baucus' request in order to visit Billings.    
Baucus was unable to make it to the Magic City because the U.S. Senate is in session. But he addressed the Business Expo live via a video conferencing system from his Washington, D.C. office.    
""Throughout Montana's history, when a newcomer arrives, they have been welcomed by a generous spirit,"" said Baucus during his live via video conferencing address. ""We will show you the lay of the land.  We will introduce you to how we do things.  We will listen to your ideas.  And we will promise to work together where we can. This is what today's event is about.  Working together.  Learning from each other.  Identifying opportunities.""    
Baucus said the Chinese are interested in buying goods and services from a host of economic sectors, including foodstuffs, agricultural, the automobile industry, software, IT, telecommunications, mining, oils, chemicals, transportation, tourism and construction, as well as many others.     
The Business Expo was split into two portions. During the morning, Montana businesses made presentations to the delegation highlighting the benefits of doing business in Montana and with Montana companies. In the afternoon, Baucus' office arranged individual one-on-one meetings between interested parties to help foster direct business relationships.     
Baucus said he will direct his office to follow up with both the Montana and Chinese companies after the expo in an effort to ink deals.     
""Today's Expo is a great opportunity to showcase the Big Sky state and all that we have to offer,"" Baucus said. ""It's a great opportunity to create more good-paying jobs and to boost our state's economy.""     
Baucus teamed up with the Big Sky EDA and the Billings-area Chamber of Commerce to host the event.    
""Montana has a champion in Senator Max Baucus,"" said Joe McClure, Big Sky EDA-EDC Executive Director. ""As Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, his seniority brings our state, the city of Billings, to the global marketplace.  Economic development knows no borders, only mutual opportunity.  Thank you Senator Baucus for your commitment to growing our economy.""        
""This is an amazing opportunity for Montana businesses,"" Brewer said. ""Chances like this don't come around every day - we have to grab hold of it and make the best pitch we can. Many thanks to Max for using his seniority to bring this high-profile delegation to Billings.""     
Before the Economic Development Summit in Butte on April 30 and May 1, Baucus played host to ambassadors from six foreign countries on a tour of several Montana companies, including Wood's Powr Grip in Laurel. Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Zhou Wenzhong, participated in the tour and attended Baucus' Jobs Summit.    
-Baucus' prepared remarks are attached-    
  Remarks to the Montana-China Expo (As Prepared)  By Senator Max Baucus  May 23, 2007 via VisionNet    
Greetings from Washington, D.C.  I wish that I could be in Billings with you today.      
But even from this distance, it is a pleasure to welcome Mr. Jin, his Ministry of Commerce colleagues, and so many exciting Chinese businesses to Montana.    
As many of you know, this delegation was already in the United States traveling to major cities, when I asked that they come to Montana.  They changed their plans, turned on a dime, and came to the Big Sky State.      
You have shown real flexibility and generosity to come to Billings on such short notice.  On behalf of all Montanans, I thank you very much.  I want to personally thank Madam Ma Xiuhong ("" Mah Shoe-HONG""), the Vice-Minister of MOFCOM for her dedicated efforts to make this mission a reality.       We also have a great showing of Montanans who have changed their plans in the middle of the week to be here.  I know you are all giving Chinese guests a warm Montana welcome.      
Distinguished Chinese visitors are becoming a familiar sight in Montana.  Just three weeks ago, I welcomed your esteemed Ambassador Zhou (""JOE"") to Billings, Bozeman, and Butte.  I plan on asking him to return.  I also hope that your trip is also the first of many.      
For my part, I will continue bringing Montanans to China, as I have for the past ten years.     
You have traveled to Montana on a well-worn path.  For centuries, the ambitious and optimistic have been coming to our state from around the world.      
Two hundred years ago, fur trappers came in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark to hunt and trade.  Then Dutch, German, and Norwegian homesteaders came to work the land.  Irish, Chinese, and Eastern European miners followed.  Today, west coast entrepreneurs are incubating biotechnology and high tech start-ups here.      
Each group came from a different place, for a unique reason, on their own path.  But every one of these groups saw the same thing in Montana.  They saw opportunity.      
Opportunity in Montana's land, in Montana's resources, and in Montana's ingenuity.  That is why all of you are in Montana today.  Looking for opportunity.  Looking for opportunity for your economy and for Montana's economy.  Looking for opportunity in cooperation and in mutual prosperity.  And looking for opportunity to create good-paying jobs.        
Let me tell you, today, like one hundred years ago, opportunity is out there.  It may not be easy to find.  But it never has been.  It was not easy for homesteaders one hundred years ago.  It is not always simple today.     
But throughout Montana's history, when a newcomer arrives, they have been welcomed by a generous spirit.  We will show you the lay of the land.  We will introduce you to how we do things.  We will listen to your ideas.  And we will promise to work together where we can.     
This is what today's event is about.  Working together.  Learning from each other.  Identifying opportunities.      
I know that Prof. Polzin already sketched a picture of Montana's economy for you.  Some of our dynamic companies - Ligocyte, Liquid Engineering, Montana Resources, MRL Equipment, and ORIgen - added color and texture to that picture.    
Now you get to the most exciting part - identifying opportunities.  Next door Montana companies have set up tables to help you learn what they do.      
You will quickly see what I already know - whatever Montanans do, they do it well.  Then all of you - our Chinese guests and Montana companies - are invited to sit down, and get to know each other one-on-one, and turn these new contacts into business opportunities.      
Again, welcome to Montana.  I wish all of you an exciting and productive afternoon.

Senator Says Senior U.S. Official Will Press Canadian Federal Government For Broad Review 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
April 24, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Montana's senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today said that Secy. Rice committed to continue working with Montana officials to stop the proposed Canadian coal mine near Glacier National Park from moving forward and promised to request a broad review by the Canadian Federal government when she meets with her Canadian counterpart in the near future.    
Baucus said that during a meeting in his Washington D.C. office today, Secretary Rice was very sympathetic to the potential dangers of the Cline Mine. Secy. Rice committed to pressing her Canadian counterpart - Foreign Minister MacKay - to have the Canadian Federal government conduct an assessment of the potential effects of the Cline Mine when she meets with him later in the week at a meeting in Oslo, Baucus said.     
""I appreciate Secy. Rice taking the time to meet with me and for working together with me to stop the Cline Mine from moving forward,"" Baucus said. ""And I appreciate Secy. Rice's assistance in pressing for a full Canadian government review on the impact of the proposed Cline Mine - I know that once the review is conducted the Cline Mine will be stopped in its tracks.""    
Baucus said the review that he and Secy. Rice are pushing for is through the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act Section 47 - which is a broad review of the potential effects of the proposed Cline Mine.    
Last month, Baucus met with Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson, who confirmed that the Canadian government plans to initiate a federal-level environmental review of the Cline Mining Company's proposal to mine coal near the headwaters of the North Fork Flathead River, which runs into Flathead Lake in Montana. Baucus said Ambassador Wilson did not confirm what kind of review it would be which is why Secy. Rice will follow up next week with Foreign Minister MacKay and noted that the review could delay the proposal for up to three years, Baucus said.    
Baucus also asked Secy. Rice to call for an investigation by the International Joint Commission if the Canadian review is not sufficiently broad in scope.  The International Joint Commission is a panel of both American and Canadian experts charged with preventing and resolving international disputes between the U.S. and Canada. The panel was instrumental, at Baucus' urging, in defeating a similar mining proposal in the same area in 1988.     
Baucus, a leading opponent of the Cline Mine proposal, said there could be devastating effects to Montana's fish, wildlife, and the recreation industry in the Flathead with ""zero economic benefits or jobs for Montanans.""    
""The Flathead is part of what defines us as Montanans - it's part of our outdoor heritage and I want to do all I can to protect it for future generations to enjoy,"" Baucus said. ""That's why I'm going to continue fighting the Cline Mine tooth and nail.""    
The Cline Mine Company recently finished a public comment period on its so-called draft terms of reference, which will outline what Cline must do to produce a satisfactory application and environmental review from the B.C. government.  But members of the Flathead Basin Commission in Montana have said the document doesn't take into account the transboundary effects the mine would have on the State of Montana.    
Baucus is Montana's senior U.S. Senator and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over international trade policy.

Senator Says Removing Dam Will Protect Blackfoot River
July 24, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  Montanas senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today hailed a decision by the U.S. Forest Service to fully remove the Mike Horse Dam on the Blackfoot River.  Its the right decision, Baucus said of the announcement. This is a big win for the Blackfoot River and for all those who work and recreate in the area.   Baucus was the first statewide elected official in July 2006 to endorse full removal of the dam.   The Forest Service looked at five options for cleaning up the aging dam and dealing with the impounded mine tailings, which are laced with heavy metals and other toxic materials.  Baucus said the dam itself is constructed of toxic mine wastes and the amount of tailings backed up behind the dam structure only increase the urgency of the cleanup.  In a news release, the Forest Service today announced it will proceed with the full removal option. The agency said it will also seek funding for the cleanup from the responsible party  Asarco.   Thats good because Montana taxpayers shouldnt be left holding the bag for cleanup, Baucus said. Im pleased to see the Forest Service is going to hold Asarco accountable in footing the bill for this.   Baucus said the dam already failed once, nearly 30 years ago, and noted the Blackfoot River is too important to Montanans to risk again on half-measures.  Full removal of Mike Horse Dam seems to be the best option to protect the Upper Blackfoot River, Baucus wrote in a July 20, 2006 letter to Abigail Kimbell, then-head of the U.S. Forest Service Region 1 area. Countless Montanans count on the Blackfoot for irrigation water and recreation. We hunt on its shores. We fish its deep pools. We take our kids floating down its rapids. Its a part of our recreational heritage as Montanans. Unfortunately, the Mike Horse Dam on the Blackfoot River threatens this gem of the Treasure State.  Baucus is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee and a senior member of the Senates Environment and Public Works Committee.  -30-

July 24, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  As part of his ongoing efforts to help Montana producers hurt by drought and other natural disasters, Montana Senator Max Baucus wants Congress to establish a permanent disaster assistance fund.   Baucus is chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over all taxes and revenue. He held a hearing of the committee today to explore ways to use the tax code to help agriculture producers.   Im sick and tired of having to go back to the Senate year after year to fight for disaster assistance when it should be a no-brainer, Baucus said. It just makes sense to have a permanent program, so ag producers arent left waiting for Congress to set aside politics and do whats right for the county.   Baucus said that hed like to see permanent agriculture disaster assistance set up in a way thats similar to the highway trust fund, which is used to pay for transportation projects around the country. Currently, farm-state Senators have to fight every year for drought assistance. A permanent fund would ensure the dollars are there for producers when needed.   Earlier this year, Congress passed another ad-hoc disaster assistance package. But for some farmers, it was too little, too late, said Baucus at todays hearing. Producers still do not have any money from disasters 2 years ago. For some producers who had a disaster in the spring of 2005, payment may not come until early 2008. A reliable program that provides immediate assistance is better for agriculture plus it saves taxpayers money in the long run. The costs of ad-hoc disaster programs will be greatly reduced if assistance is immediate.  Baucus is also a senior member of the Senates Agriculture Committee and hes working with that committees chairman, Tom Harkin, on a new Farm Bill.  Baucus today floated the following principles for permanent disaster assistance:   cover all agricultural disasters including grazing losses, specialty crops and livestock deaths due to natural disasters;  compliment, not replace, existing crop insurance;  focus on a farmer or ranchers shallow income losses not covered by crop insurance;  help producers when their anticipated whole farm revenue, based upon historical production, falls below their actual production due to a natural disaster;  provide dependable, timely relief immediately after a disaster.  When a community or an industry is impacted by a natural disaster such as a hurricane or tornado, we extend a helping hand. Agriculture should be not be different, Baucus said. Agriculture is the backbone of our states economy and one way to make sure it stays that way is to make agriculture disaster assistance permanent. I look forward to working together with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture and Finance Committees on ways to make it happen.   -30-

Senator Praises Social Security Administration For Including Tremolite Asbestos-related Disease
May 24, 2006
(Washington D.C.) Montana Senator Max Baucus today announced Libby residents and former Libby residents will now be eligible to apply for Social Security Disability benefits.   

Baucus said prior to todayâs announcement only people suffering from chrysotile asbestosis could qualify for disability benefits. The Social Security Administration did not have disability benefit criteria specific to amphibole asbestosis, the kind of asbestos related disease that the people of Libby and former Libby residents suffer from.  

As part of his ongoing efforts to help Libby residents that are suffering from years of asbestos exposure, Baucus worked together with the Social Security Administration to allow Libby residents and others suffering from exposure to amphibole asbestos to be eligible to apply for Social Security disability benefits.  

âThis is great news for the people of Libby,â? Baucus said. âIâve been fighting for years to help current and former Libby residents get the assistance they need and deserve to help with their pain and suffering. Today weâre able to help provide them some relief.â?  

Libby residents suffering from amphibole asbestosis who were previously denied benefits by the Social Security Administration can now reapply and Baucus said he is urging them to do so.  

Baucus said that more than 1400 current and former Libby residents suffer from amphobile asbestosis due to W.R. Graceâs vermiculite mine that operated in Libby until 1990. Baucus noted that 300 to 500 new cases are diagnosed each year and that more than 200 Libby residents have already died from asbestos-related disease.   

Since news reports first brought the tragedy in Libby to light in 1999, Baucus has helped secure millions of federal dollars for cleanup, health care, and economic development. He was the first high-ranking elected official to visit Libby in 2000, and has visited 17 times since then.  

Baucus helped secure the funds needed to start the Center for Asbestos Related Diseases, commonly known as the CARD clinic, in 1999 from then-HHS Secretary Donna Shalala. The CARD clinic specializes in diagnosing and treating disease caused by tremolite asbestos, Baucus said.  

âPeople from Libby suffer from asbestos-related disease at a rate 40 to 60 times the national average and they suffer from the asbestos cancer mesothelioma at a rate of 100 times the national average,â? Baucus said. âThe people of Libby have suffered enough. Libby residents can count on me to keep fighting for them until Libby is fully cleaned up and all residents receive the benefits they need and deserve.â?

Senator Backs Legislation To Curb Greenhouse Gas Emissions
October 24, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) In announcing his support for legislation to help combat global warming, Montana Senator Max Baucus today may have given Congress the boost it needs to pass climate change legislation this year.   Baucus -- long considered a moderate consensus builder and key vote on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  today backed the Americas Climate Security Act, groundbreaking legislation aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 70 percent by the year 2050.   During an EPW subcommittee hearing on the bill today, Baucus said America must aggressively combat climate change.   We cannot be good stewards if we ignore the fact that climate change threatens to result in longer droughts, more severe wildfire seasons, and no glaciers in Glacier National Park, Baucus during the panel hearing. I believe it is a moral imperative to deal with climate change. That is why I intend to support Americas Climate Security Act.   For months Baucus has been quietly working with the bills sponsors -- Sens. Joe Lieberman (I  Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.) on the legislation.   The senior U.S. Senator today threw his considerable weight behind the bill after Lieberman and Warner agreed to include provisions that will, among other things, help Montanas coal industry transition into cleaner practices and give farmers a chance to be part of the climate change solution.   Baucus was given the opportunity to pick one of five witnesses to appear before the EPW subcommittee today. He chose Will Roehm, a third-generation wheat farmer from Great Falls who serves as vice president of the Montana Grain Growers Association. Roehm backed the bill and said Americas farmers are eager to help tackle climate change.   The American farmer has long been a careful steward of the land and the environment, Roehm told the lawmakers, and contributing to the reduction of environmentally harmful levels of greenhouse gasses is a logical extension of what we see as our stewardship responsibilities.   The Lieberman-Warner bill would place a hard cap on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions allowed to enter the atmosphere. But as part of that, industries can buy so-called offsets or carbon credits from entities that sequester carbon or reduce the overall amount of carbon in the air. Its known as a cap-and-trade system.   For example a wheat grower that practices no-till farming sequesters a quantifiable amount of carbon, thereby generating an offset that can be purchased by an energy company. The system could be a boon to agriculture in Montana while sharply curbing the amount of greenhouse gas in the air, Baucus said.   Baucus helped inject several provisions good for Montana in the bill, including incentives for the coal industry to develop and use carbon capture and sequestration technology, opportunities for Montana farmers to create carbon offsets through activities like no-till farming, and protection from rising energy prices for Montanas rural electric cooperatives.  The bill also strengthens energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings in order to address commercial- and residential-sector emissions that are not covered by the cap.     Statement of Senator Max Baucus Environment and Public Works Committee A Hearing to Examine Americas Climate Security Act of 2007 Wednesday October 24th, 2007 2:30 PM  Senators Lieberman and Warner, thank you for all of your work on this critical issue and for agreeing to hold this hearing to take a closer look at the provisions in your bill. I would also like to thank all of the witnesses for agreeing to testify and share their perspectives on the issue of climate change.  I am especially excited to have a fellow Montanan here testifying. Will Roehm is a third generation wheat farmer from Great Falls, Montana. As Vice President of the Montana Grain Growers Association, Will is here to highlight the important role of agricultural offsets in any cap and trade system. Welcome Will. I look forward to your testimony. The Book of Genesis tells us that The Lord God then took the man and settled him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and care for it. Montanans take Gods call to be good stewards very seriously. This means that we must address the issue of climate change. We cannot be good stewards if we ignore the fact that climate change threatens to result in longer droughts, more severe wildfire seasons, and no glaciers in Glacier National Park.  I believe it is a moral imperative to deal with climate change. That is why I intend to support Americas Climate Security Act. I believe the bill Senators Lieberman and Warner have crafted represents a reasonable approach to dealing with the issue.  While I have some outstanding concerns with the bill, Im confident I can work through those issues with Senators Lieberman and Warner.  The bill strikes a good balance. The 2050 emissions reductions targets the bill sets align with the US CAP recommendations and put the US on path to be a leader in addressing climate change. The bill also includes strong provisions to incentivise the deployment of carbon capture and sequestration.  Stopping coal fired power plants will not stop climate change; clean coal technology will stop climate change. This issue is crucial.   Even if another coal fired power plant was never built in the US, China would continue to develop their coal resources. We must develop carbon capture and sequestration technology here so that we can use it domestically, as well as export it abroad.   That is why I am pleased that Senators Lieberman and Warner have included several provisions to incentivise the deployment of carbon capture and sequestration. Their bill sets aside 4% of annual allowances through 2035 to go towards bonus allowances for power plants that capture and sequester their carbon.  The bill also sets aside 52% of auction revenues for next generation energy development. Of this amount 28% is set aside for developing and deploying carbon capture and sequestration.  Americas Climate Security Act also includes the best offset provisions of any of the economy wide cap and trade bills. Americas farmers and foresters have an important role to play in stopping climate change.  I am pleased that the bill allows regulated entities to satisfy up to 15% of their allowance obligations through domestic offsets from Americas farmers and foresters.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Lieberman and Warner on ways to improve the bill. Specifically, Im concerned about the impact of a cap and trade system on rural electric cooperatives. Rural co-ops provide cost based power to low income areas and unlike investor owned utilities lack the resources to invest in cutting edge technology and to mitigate the impacts to their members. I also want to make sure that costs to the economy are weighed carefully.  We have a moral imperative to address climate change. Americas Climate Security Act is a balanced approach to a challenging issue. I look forward to working with my colleagues keep the process moving forward.

September 24, 2007
(Washington D.C.)  The U.S. Senate today sent President Bush a bill that includes Sen. Max Baucus $153 million authorization for the aging St Marys Diversion on the Hi-Line.  Baucus secured the funding authorization as part of the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, which passed the U.S. Senate today. The bill now heads to President Bushs desk.  Baucus was a lead author and member of the joint House and Senate conference committee, which ironed out differences in the bill.   Baucus inserted the St. Marys authorization language into the bill. The move is the first in a two-step process to get funds appropriated for the project. Once the $153 million authorization is finalized, Baucus and Montanas Congressional Delegation can ask Congress to appropriate the dollars.  We appreciate all of Maxs hard work and dedication in getting this done for St. Marys, said Larry Mires, Executive Director of the St. Mary Rehabilitation Working Group. This authorization will really help us move forward. Its great news for folks along the Hi-line and we commend Max for all he has done.   The 85-year-old St. Marys diversion, which redirects the Milk River to provide water for municipal and irrigation use along the states northern border, is in bad disrepair.   This is a long time coming and Im glad this day is finally here, said Baucus, chairman of the EPW Committees Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the WRDA bill. Having water to drink and use for irrigation shouldnt be a privilege it should be a right, and thats why I fought so hard for the St. Marys project. Its vital to jobs and the economy along the Hi-Line. Weve cleared the first major hurdle for St. Marys. Now well fight to get it the project across the goal line.  The canal delivers water from the St. Mary River at Babb to Glasgow and Nashua, serving three municipalities  Malta, Conrad, and Havre. More than 17,000 Hi-Line residents get their water from the system, and about 150,000 acres of farmland are irrigated by it.  Although the diversion is operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, local irrigators have been saddled with funding operations and upkeep.   This is a critical investment for Montanaone that will make one of our most precious resources more accessible to the folks who make their living on the land, said Sen. Jon Tester, who saw firsthand the various water projects across the Hi-Line last month. Max and I are committed to fighting for and getting good projects like this funded to keep water flowing from Cut Bank to Culbertson.  In 2005, Baucus helped write and pass a highway bill that is now helping to fund construction projects across Montana. As part of that bill, Baucus included $8 million for St. Marys diversion.   Baucus has been working with both the Blackfeet and Fort Belknap tribes to protect their interests, as well as local officials, irrigators, and recreationalists on the project for several years.    Baucus also included several other Montana projects in the WRDA Act:    Missoula Riverfront Development: This authorization would go to the Army Corp of Engineers to restore a 45 acres section of land along the banks of the Clark Fork. The funds would go towards restoring the banks, as well as building recreational cites. This provision is authorized at $5 million.   Yellowstone River Protection: This provision would allow the Corps to plan projects on the Yellowstone that are identified in the course of the Cumulative Impacts Study, without having to wait on specific authorization for each project. This provision is authorized at $30 million. Projects would include fish passage, irrigation improvements, bank stabilization, etc.    Intake at Glendive, Montana: The Intake Project consists of two parts: (1) constructing a device which would prevent downstream entrainment of fish into the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation system and (2) enabling fish to bypass the irrigation diversion at Intake during upstream migration. Additionally, the Intake project would open the Yellowstone River just 70 miles upstream from its confluence with the Missouri, creating a 238 mile reach for sturgeon spawning and rearing, much greater than any remaining open reaches between dams on the Missouri main stem.    Missouri River and Tributaries Recovery: This provision authorizes a study funded through the Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Mitigation Program to determine necessary actions to mitigate loss of habitat, recover endangered species, and restore the ecosystem along the Missouri.   -30-

January 25, 2007
(Washington D.C.) â During a news conference in Washington, D.C., Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus today announced a new grant project to help more Libby residents own their own homes.  

Baucus was joined by Fannie Mae CEO Dan Mudd in announcing a new $75,000 housing assistance program designed to help people who want to own new homes, and to help keep those who already own a home from defaulting.  In addition to personalized credit counseling services, the grant will help launch a website for people to get online help with financial questions.   

The grant also carves out $15,000 to help Lincoln County finalize a growth plan to anticipate working family housing needs and future development projects such as schools, parks, and economic development initiatives.   

Fannie Mae is a quasi governmental organization that helps provide affordable housing assistance.  

Late last year, Baucus met with Mudd to discuss possible housing projects in Libby. After meeting with Baucus, Mudd dispatched a Fannie Mae team to Libby to assess the situation, determining that a need exists for affordable housing assistance.   

âLet me emphasize, this is all just a start,â? Mudd said today. âBe assured that Iâm going to keep my eye on this because helping communities like Libby is exactly why   
Fannie Mae exists. And Iâm sure Senator Baucus will keep an eye on me too, which I appreciate.â?  

âThis project is a great example of what working together can accomplish,â? Baucus said. âThis housing project is just another piece in the puzzle to help the people of Libby.â?  

Fannie Maeâs Commitment To Libby  
â¢           $50,000 to support Montana Homeownership Networkâs foreclosure prevention and owner-occupied rehabilitation programs: This grant is helping train home ownership counselors on default counseling and advanced credit counseling.  

â¢           $10,000 for Home Counselor Online programs with Northwestern Montana Human Resources: This grant will help Northwestern Montana Human Resources to reactivate Home Counselor Online as well as train the staff of the program   

â¢           $15,000 to support the development of Lincoln Countyâs growth plan: This grant will help Lincoln County finalize its growth plan.  

In addition to the $75,000 grant, Fannie Mae has helped establish the âLibby Housing Collaborative,â? which is a working group organized and facilitated by the Montana Community Business Center. Members include the Montana Board of Housing, the Montana Home Ownership Network, and Sen. Baucusâ office.  The Collaborative will work on drafting a housing and community development strategy for Libby.

Senator Says All Montanans, Americans Have A Right To Quality, Affordable Health Care

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
July 25, 2007
(Washington, D.C.)  At a large rally on Capitol Hill today, Montana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, joined the American Association of Retired Persons to highlight the need for health care for all Montanans and Americans.  Baucus was one of only two members of Congress to have a speaking role at the rally, which was attended by more than 2,000 people. The goal of the event was to push for universal health care for all Americans.   Earlier this year, Baucus held a hearing in his committee about the need for universal health care. Baucus made clear that hes not endorsing a solely government-funded health care system, sometimes called single-payer, but rather he says a combination of private and public healthcare entities will likely be needed to cover all Americans.   One in six Americans does not have access to health care, Baucus said. And in my home state of Montana, an even greater percentage of people have limited access to health care: 1 in 5 Montanans lack health insurance. Businesses struggle to continue to offer health benefits and remain competitive in the face of ever-increasing costs. Employees grapple with having to pay more for coverage, while getting less care. Its not right and Im going to fight to make it right.  Claudia Clifford, associate director for AARP in Montana, was in Washington, D.C., for the rally on Capitol Hill.   We applaud Senator Baucus for his leadership and work on universal health care and Social Security, said Clifford. And were proud to work together with Senator Baucus on the Divided We Fail campaign  a partnership of Republicans and Democrats and a variety of groups all working together to provide health care for all Montanans and Americans.  As Finance Committee Chairman, Baucus has jurisdiction over the nations health care programs  Medicare, Medicaid, and the Childrens Health Insurance Program. Baucus has made renewing and expanding CHIP his top health care priority this year.   Baucus said hes optimistic that a solution to the nations health care challenges can be reached  though its going to take time and a lot of working together. He said there are five key principles to health care reform.  Baucus Health Care Reform Principles  1) Universal coverage: Baucus said America is the only industrialized country in the world that doesnt guarantee health care for its citizens. He noted changes to Americas health care system cant be addressed while leaving a growing portion of the country behind.  2) Sharing the burden: Neither the employer-based system nor the individual market can fulfill the demand for affordable, portable, quality coverage, Baucus said. One way to ensure affordable coverage is to create pooling arrangements. Purchasing pools would bring together large numbers of small purchasers  both individuals and small businesses  and allow them to take advantage of group rates for coverage. 3) Controlling costs: America cannot sustain its current rate of growth in health care spending, Baucus said, noting any serious proposal must reduce skyrocketing health care costs. 4) Prevention: American health care tends to address what happens once people are already sick, Baucus said. By making prevention the foundation of Americas health care system, the country can avoid the high costs of treating an illness that has been allowed to progress.  5) Shared responsibility: Baucus said everybody must shoulder the burden of a new health care system together, not one sector or entity  private or public.   -30-

(Washington, D.C)  Montana Senator Max Baucus is putting his money where his mouth is when it comes to climate change.  The senior U.S. Senator today offset his carbon emissions for air travel between Montana and Washington, D.C., paying $1,152 dollars for a years worth of travel to begin to help establish a carbon-neutral footprint.  Baucus today became the first U.S. Senator to use services provided by Native Energy, a privately held Native American energy company, to offset his official Senate travel.  NativeEnergy is a trusted leader in providing high-quality carbon offsets. Assisting consumers and businesses in offsetting carbon emitting activities, NativeEnergy invests in the development of new renewable energy projects. The net effect: less greenhouse gas entering the atmosphere.  Baucus went online today from his Washington office and bought the credits. Through NativeEnergy, a roundtrip flight from Washington, D.C., to Billings, Mont. costs $24 to offset. (http://www.nativeenergy.com/)  Baucus said the offset program is a small thing leaders can do to help address climate change as Congress debates legislation to help curb greenhouse gases. He also encouraged Montanans to get involved in the offsetting program to help fight global warming. Baucus money will be invested in new wind energy projects.  NativeEnergy President  CEO Tom Boucher said, We need to see political leadership on this critically important issue, and that is what Senator Baucus is providing by his personal action today  demonstrating that we can all support real and effective solutions to the climate crisis.  Baucus is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. He also serves as a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over climate change legislation. Hes been a member of the EPW Committee since he first joined the Senate in 1979.  I thought it would be a good idea to put into practice personally what weve been pushing legislatively, Baucus said. Through carbon offsets, we can chip away at the problem while long-term solutions are worked out in Washington. This is a small thing Montanans and Americans can do that will have a big impact on the climate change problem.  Baucus was the first member of Montanas Congressional Delegation to publicly advocate for an economy wide cap-and-trade system that would cap the total amount of carbon released into the atmosphere but allow carbon-emitting industries to purchase credits on the open market.  The senior U.S. Senator is also aggressively pursuing tax incentives to boost alternative energy production, including wind, solar, biomass, and ethanol.  As an author the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, Baucus helped establish the first ever cap-and-trade program for sulfur dioxide.  Baucus pointed to the extended drought in Montana, and warned of worse conditions in the years to come if America doesnt aggressively tackle global warming. He said explosive wildfires, drought, and erratic weather patterns hurt the states economy.  Unrelenting drought, river closures, shorter ski seasons, and explosive wildfires hurt Montanas economy, Baucus said. Its that simple. We need to go after climate change with everything weve got. We have to curb our greenhouse gas emissions.  -30-

p> (Washington, D.C.) -- A U.S. Senate panel has passed asbestos reform legislation that includes Montana Senator Max Baucus' provision to give sick residents in the small northwest Montana town at least $400,000 in compensation from exposure to asbestos fibers.  
 After months of deliberation, the Senate Judiciary Committee today passed legislation aimed at reforming how asbestos lawsuits are handled across the country.   Baucus got Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Penn.) to include his so-called ""Libby Fix"" that takes into account the unique circumstances in Libby and will ensure residents there get the compensation they need and deserve.   The bill is now ready to be considered by the full Senate. Baucus said he is gearing up to protect the Libby provisions as the bill advances.  ""This is a huge, giant step forward for the folks in Libby who were poisoned at the hands of W.R. Grace,"" said Baucus, who has been working on the provision for more than a year. ""Now it's time to wage a defensive campaign to get the Libby Fix through the Senate and ultimately to President Bush.""  The Libby Fix includes:   Libby claimants are exempted from the exposure criteria in the bill -- they just have to establish that they lived, worked or played within a 20-mile radius of Libby for any 12-month period prior to December 31, 2004;  
 Libby claimants are exempted from the bill's medical criteria if they choose to have their claims referred to an expert Physician's Panel;   The bill would also establish basic medical criteria applicable only to Libby claimants to ensure that the Physicians Panel will treat the Libby claimants fairly;   If the Libby claimants comply with the Libby-specific medical criteria, they will receive a Level 4 award, or $400,000, essentially establishing a floor of compensation of $400,000 for sick Libby claimants;   The language would also provide a mechanism to ensure that if a Libby claimant with a non-malignant asbestos-related disease became sicker, they could apply to the fund again for the higher Level 5 award, which is $850,000.  
 ""I think it is really important to recognize that the needs of Libby residents have only been considered in asbestos litigation reform negotiations because Max Baucus had the foresight and the ability to bring this to the attention of Congress again and again,"" said Milton Datsopoulos, a Missoula attorney working with the legal team representing asbestos victims in Libby.  Baucus visited Libby in March for the 16th time since 1999. Libby residents told the senator they didn't want him to support an asbestos bill that doesn't include adequate compensation.

May 26, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â U.S. Senator Max Baucus today hailed the Beartooth Highway opening for summer visitors and traffic.  

Following damaging mudslides that washed out much of the Beartooth Highway south of Red Lodge last May, Baucus quickly responded by securing $22 million for its repair. The funding was included in the federal highway construction funding bill that Baucus helped write and pass last July.  

Baucus credits Governor Schweitzer and Montana Transportation Officials for getting the road repaired and reopened ahead of schedule.  

âItâs great news that the scenic Beartooth Highway is opening on time this year â itâs great for the community, tourists and our entire state,â? Baucus said. âThe Beartooth Highway is a crown jewel for Montana and the rest of the country.â?  

Baucus, who toured the mudslides and held a community meeting in Red Lodge last May, was a key author of the highway construction bill, which will pump more than $2.3 billion into Montanaâs economy over the next five years.   

Baucus made the case for the funding by highlighting the road as not only a Montana treasure â but a national one as well.   

Montana Department of Transportation officials estimate the total costs of repairs to the road to be about $24 million. Federal highway officials in June released $2 million to begin cleanup and repair efforts, and Baucus secured the remaining funds needed.  

Baucus, in his role as a senior member of the Senate highways panel, also secured more than $19 million for the Beartooth Highway in 1998.

October 26, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus today praised the President for signing his Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act into law, a bill that will help keep gun makers from being wrongfully held accountable for gun crimes.    
Baucus, the lead Democratic author of the bill in the Senate, teamed up with Senator Larry Craig (R-Idaho) get the measure passed. He said that the purpose of the bill is to prevent baseless lawsuits and to protect the rights of gun owners and manufacturers. Baucus noted that the bill had strong support from members from both sides of the aisle â 58 senators cosponsored the measure in the Senate.    
""Today is a good day for Montana and for law-abiding gun owners and users all across the country,"" Baucus said. ""Montana is an outdoors state. Itâs an important part of our stateâs heritage and itâs important to keep that heritage for future generations. We hunt. We fish. We teach our kids how to responsibly shoot guns. That's why I strongly support the second amendment. And thatâs why gun makers should not be held responsible for the acts of criminals.""    
Baucus worked with the National Rifle Association to write this legislation and the organization supported the bill that was singed into law today.    
""The Bush administration was a vital ally during debate on Capitol Hill. I would also like to thank Senators Larry Craig and Max Baucus and Congressmen Rick Boucher and Cliff Stearns for doing a yeoman's job as lead co-sponsors of this legislation,"" said Chris Cox of the National Rifle Association.    
Baucus, a long-time supporter of the second amendment, teamed up with Craig in 2003 to first introduce the measure; however it failed in the Senate because of two controversial amendments that were added at the last minute. Baucus said that both the earlier bill and the bill signed by the President today have the same intent â if a gun is used while a person is committing a crime, the person committing the crime will be held responsible, not the manufacturer. Baucus said this is an important and much-needed piece of legislation for gun manufacturers and law-abiding gun owners alike.

October 26, 2005
(Washington, D.C.)  Uncle Sam owes $167,000 to nearly 250 Montanans whose 2004 tax refund checks were returned to the post office, U.S. Senator Max Baucus said today. 
The refund checks were returned likely due to bad addresses, Baucus said, urging Montanans to contact the IRS to see if they are entitled to a refund. Nearly 250 Montanans didnt get their tax refund check back from the federal government, Baucus said. The IRS is trying to get these checks resent, but they need help finding the folks they belong to. Baucus said the average outstanding Montana refund is $672.19, from as little as $1.00 to as much as $15,734.00. They can be reissued as soon as Montanans correct or update their addresses with the IRS.  The IRS is holding checks belonging to 249 Montanans, including 28 taxpayers in Billings, 15 in Great Falls, 11 in Helena, 42 in Bozeman, 33 in Missoula, and 16 in Kalispell, Baucus said.  The agency contacted Baucus about the checks because he is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes and the IRS.  If Montanans move or change their address and fail to notify the IRS or the U.S. Postal Service, a check sent to their last known address is returned to the IRS. Montanans who have moved since filing their last tax return can ensure the IRS has their correct address by filing Form 8822, Change of Address, with the IRS. Download the form or request it by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676). 
Those without access to the Internet, who think they may be missing a refund, should call the IRS toll-free assistance line at 1-800-829-1040. Related Links:  Wheres My Refund? Form 8822, Change of Address

October 26, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) Montanas Senator Max Baucus today praised the Senate Agriculture Committee for passing a new Farm Bill that includes a solid safety net for wheat and barley producers, stops Farm Service Agency office closures, boosts alternative energy, and finally implements Country-of-Origin Labeling on meat products.   The panel cleared the bill today unanimously, readying it for full Senate action as early as next week.   Baucus, a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, helped write the new five-year bill, which will serve as a blueprint for agriculture programs across the country.   For more than a year, Baucus traveled around the state holding listening sessions in small Montana communities. And, as the only member of Montanas Congressional delegation on the Ag Committee, held two official hearings of that committee in Great Falls to get input from Montanas producers.   Baucus said the Ag Committees unanimous passage bodes well for the bill on the Senate floor.   This is a big win for Montana, Baucus said. And were going to make the bill even better when it reaches the Senate floor. Weve been negotiating this bill for a long time. Today, the committee did the right thing for producers. Montana farmers and ranchers will come out very well in this bill. They should be pleased. Now were going to take the ball across the goal line.  Baucus helped insert several provisions in the bill for Montana, including a payment boost for wheat and barley; programs to help producers develop alternative energy, and a September 30, 2008 implementation date for the long-awaited Country-Of-Origin law.   Baucus was also successful today in attaching an amendment with Senator John Thune (R-S.D.) to halt Farm Service Agency office closures that are more than 20 miles apart for the life of the Farm Bill.  Provisions Baucus Inserted For Montana Producers:  Farm Service Agency Offices  The 7 FSA offices in Montana will remain open for length of new bill.   Wheat and barley  The bill boosts funding for wheat and barley so those commodities are treated more fairly under the countercyclical program.  Interstate Shipment of State-inspected meat  Allows state-inspected meat to be sold in other states, which will enable smaller packers to compete and sell their inspected meat across the country.  Beginning Farmers and Ranchers  Includes new funding to help encourage more young people to get into farming and ranching.   COOL  Technical change that will enable Country-of-Origin Labeling to be implemented smoothly by September 30, 2008.  Nixes the 5 percent crop insurance surcharge on organic crops  Montana is one of Americas largest producers of organic wheat  Camelina crop insurance  Requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to establish a pilot camelina crop insurance program so producers can help lesson Americas independence on foreign fossil fuels.   Boosts Funding For Nutrition Programs  School lunch and food stamps is slated to receive a $4 billion increase. Also, creates a program for fresh fruits and vegetables for kids.  On-Farm/Rural Areas Energy Production  Carves out grants to encourage producers to produce alternative energy.   Improves the Conservation Stewardship (or Security) Program  CSP  and provides $1.28 million increase over 5 years.   Bee Habitat  Boosts bee and other pollinator habitat to help combat a sharp decline in colonies.  Baucus also wrote and passed a bill to establish a permanent, $5 billion agriculture disaster assistance fund  so producers facing losses due to drought dont have to return to Congress year after year for assistance. Baucus provision, which passed out of the Finance Committee last week, will likely be included in the Farm Bill when the measure reaches the floor of the U.S. Senate.  -30-

April 27, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â Montanaâs senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, today introduced two bills to help make the new Medicare prescription drug benefit program less confusing for seniors and more fair for pharmacists.   

âOur seniors deserve quality, affordable, common-sense health care and thatâs why Iâm introducing this legislation,â? Baucus said. âThe Medicare prescription drug benefit right now is way too complicated. This legislation will enable Montana seniors make apples-to-apples comparisons so they can get the prescription drugs they need at a price they deserve. We can make this new program work, we just need to work together to fine-tune it.â?   

Baucus, who worked to create the Medicare drug benefit in 2003, said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ignored warnings against approving too many plans, noting seniors werenât given clear comparisons of the plans as the drug benefit was implemented.    

Currently in many states, insurers are offering multiple plans with different names, inconsistent terminology, and wildly varying benefit packages, Baucus said, noting Montana seniors have more than 40 different plans to choose from.  The resulting confusion is keeping many seniors from signing up for the benefit, he said.  

At a press conference in Washington, D.C. today, Baucus unveiled his legislation that will make it easier for benefit comparisons by allowing seniors to choose a benefit package. The bill will also prohibit plans from changing drug coverage during the benefit year, prohibit unfair plan marketing practices to Medicare beneficiaries, and boost the plansâ performance ratings in their annual approval by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  

Baucus also introduced the Pharmacy Access Improvement (PhAIm) Act of 2006.  This bill addresses pharmacy-related problems that have arisen as the drug benefited is implemented. The bill will require drug plans to reimburse pharmacies more quickly and conveniently, establish help hotlines for pharmacists and physicians alike, and cut back on the practice of so-called pharmacy âco-brandingâ? by plans that can lead some patients to believe that only certain pharmacies can provide their medicines.    

âThe drug benefit plan should not be a guessing game for seniors,â? Baucus said. âIt should be a simple, clear â what you see is what you get plan. Our seniors should have the peace of mind that what they sign up for is indeed what they are entitled to â things shouldnât disappear or change midway through. Iâm committed to doing all I can to ensure that our Montana seniors have access to quality, affordable health care that makes sense.â?  

The Medicare Simplification Act of 2006:  

â¢           Requires the Health and Human Services Secretary to develop, in addition to the standard prescription drug package outlined in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, five additional types of benefit packages to be offered under Medicare Part D.  Three will be basic packages that would not include coverage of medications during the âcoverage gapâ? that occurs when patientsâ drug bills reach a certain cost.  Two will be supplemental packages that will include coverage of drugs during that gap before catastrophic coverage begins.    
â¢           The HHS department will develop standardized wording, definitions and formats for all packages to help seniors understand and compare them more easily.   
â¢           The simplification bill will solve another problem for Medicare beneficiaries by prohibiting plans from dropping coverage of a drug during a benefit year, and to provide clear information about any changes planned for the next benefit period.    
â¢           Requires drug plans to provide more and clearer information about what drugs they cover.  The process of appealing drug coverage decisions will be streamlined and standardized.     


The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act of 2006:  

â¢           Aims to address problems that have arisen for both pharmacists and Medicare beneficiaries during implementation of the benefit so far.    
â¢           Requires plans to reimburse pharmacies for drug costs within as little as 14 days for electronically filed claims, and within 30 days for all other claims.    
â¢           Requires reasonable dispensing fees to pharmacies.    
â¢           Plan providers will be required to establish hotlines offering more timely and accurate information to pharmacists and physicians.    
â¢           Drug plans will be required to use only pharmacies that are true âpoints of accessâ? for the general public.    
â¢           The bill will also place restrictions on the practice of âco-brandingâ? drug benefit cards and materials with pharmacy names.  

Baucus said the legislation will be considered by the Finance Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly.

February 27, 2007
(Washington D.C.) - Montana Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Finance Committee, today said America must do more to break its reliance on foreign sources of energy.     
""America is too dependent on unstable foreign energy sources,"" Baucus said today during a hearing of his committee. ""America has a big energy problem.  But America finds solutions to big problems.""    
Baucus today introduced a bill in the Senate to establish a cutting-edge new research agency that would develop solutions to America's energy problems. Baucus likened the new agency to the WWII-era Manhattan Project, which used innovative technology and research to develop the world's first nuclear bomb.     
Baucus' bill would set aside more than $5 billion over the next five years to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency â Energy, or ARPA-E.      
The new agency would be modeled on DARPA â the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which, among other things, developed the Internet and stealth technology for aircraft.     
""We can do the same with [energy],"" Baucus said. ""We should start with another Manhattan Project â for energy.""     
Baucus said in addition to advancing research, other answers to the energy problem lie in alternative energy, renewable energy, improved efficiency, and smarter use of conventional sources, ""with strong consideration for climate change.""      
Baucus said America should continue to advance the use of biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol made from grain stubble. He also noted that Montana farmers are eager to produce oil-seed crops such as Camelina.       He also said more emphasis should be given to energy conversation and efficiency efforts.   ""We can build smarter buildings.  We can turn on more efficient light bulbs.  We can produce and use electricity more efficiently.  We can even do things as simple as turning off our computers at night,"" Baucus said, noting that turning off American computer monitors alone could save more than $1 billion a year.     
Baucus said Montana has about eight percent of the world's coal reserves and that America should ""make use of this abundant resource.  And we should do so responsibly.""    
""Sequestering the carbon emitted from coal-fired plants is the right thing to do,"" Baucus said.  Baucus invited Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer to testify before the hearing.    
""Brian has made energy policy the cornerstone of his administration,"" Baucus said. ""He's worked hard on renewable sources, ethanol, biodiesel, and the clean use of Montana's vast coal reserves.""       
Baucus has worked to spur alternative energy sources in Montana and across the country through his work in the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax incentives.    In 2005, Baucus wrote the Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) program, to provide tax-free financing for wind energy projects.  Montana will be provided up to $72 million for 34 new wind energy projects planned mostly by small cities and counties in northeastern and southeastern Montana.  In December, Baucus successfully pushed to extend the CREBs program and increased its funding.

June 27, 2006
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) â Montana U.S. Senator Max Baucus today praised the Senate for including a measure in the Department of Defense Authorization bill that would empower the National Guard within the Pentagon.    

The Department of Defense Authorization bill serves as a blueprint for how the Defense Department will operate during the next year.    

The measure that was included in the Defense Department Authorization bill that the Senate passed last week, which Baucus co-sponsored, would empower the U.S. National Guard by raising the National Guard Chief to full General and would secure the NORTHCOM deputy position as a National Guard officer. The measure would also grant the Guard the power to deal directly with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.    

âOur Montana guardsmen and women are vital to protecting Montana and our country,â? Baucus said. âAnd they should have a say in what operations they participate and where their resources are used â this measure helps to do just that.â?    

The measure was sponsored by Senators Kit Bond (R-Mo.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and had overwhelming support from both Republicans and Democrats.    

Earlier this year Baucus co-sponsored similar legislation - the National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act of 2006. The Defense Dept. Authorization bill included the majority of the National Guard Empowerment Act of 2006 when it passed the Senate    

âOur Guard personnel are long overdue for the treatment and respect they deserve,â? Baucus said. âThe Guard knows whatâs right for the Guard. And this legislation will enable the Guard to help decide where to deploy their troops and how to spend their budget. Our Guard members are true patriots and they have my full support. They can count on me to work together with my colleagues to make sure this measure stays in the overall bill and is signed into law by the President.â?    

Baucus said that the Guard plays an important role in Americaâs defense at home and abroad and noted there are many obstacles that prevent the force from reaching its full potential. Earlier this year the Army proposed significant cuts to Guard troop strength. Also, last year during the Base Realignment and Closure Commission process the Air Guard was on the chopping block and neither the Adjutant Generals nor the Governors were consulted about their fate.    

The National Guard has a long history of assisting America's military abroad while providing support and security at home. Since the attacks on September 11, 2001, the National Guard has taken on even greater responsibilities in the realm of homeland security. Also, the Guard has been a tremendous value for the capabilities it provides as one of the nationâs primary military reserves, providing 40 percent of the total military force for around 4.5 percent of the defense budget, Baucus said.     

Baucus, the only member of the Montana delegation to co-sponsor the measure, said the House has already passed its version of the Defense Dept. Authorization bill and the two bills will now go to conference committee to iron differences before heading to the Presidentâs desk for his expected signature.

Senators' Measure To Get Rid Of REAL ID Stalls Sweeping Immigration Bill

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
June 27, 2007
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester brought the debate over immigration reform to a grinding halt today on the Senate floor. After opponents of Baucus and Testers amendment to strike REAL ID requirements failed to muster a majority of votes, debate on the controversial immigration bill came to a standstill.   Baucus and Testers provision strikes language from the immigration bill that requires employers to check the eligibility of their prospective employees only using identification documents that comply with REAL ID, a federal mandate the Montana senators say amounts to a national ID system.  Opponents failed to kill the Baucus-Tester amendment today on a thin 45-52 vote. It wasnt immediately clear what effect the vote will have on the underlying bill, but opponents have called the provisions a deal breaker as it relates to the whole immigration bill. Baucus said he thinks the vote is a death knell to a bad immigration bill. Senate business, which was early slated to extend into Wednesday evening, halted for the night after the controversial Baucus-Tester vote.   We scored a major victory today in our efforts to protect privacy and defeat a bad immigration bill at the same time, said Baucus, Montanas senior U.S. Senator. If Jon and I just brought down the entire bill, thats good for Montana and the country.   REAL ID requires states to standardize their drivers licenses and build costly new databases that the federal government can access, essentially creating a national ID system. Earlier this year, the Montana Legislature unanimously passed legislation refusing to implement the program because it invades privacy and can expose private information to identity thieves, and because of its enormous cost.  Tester, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and a staunch supporter of privacy rights, said REAL ID isnt needed to toughen national security.  If by fighting to keep government out of peoples private lives, Max Baucus and I stopped the senate from passing this flawed immigration bill, then this was a real victory for Montana and the American people, Tester said.   Baucus and Tester cited several other reasons for their amendment:   Employers dont need REAL ID to verify the eligibility of their employees. They currently check eligibility using existing documents, such as birth certificates, a drivers license, or a passport.   More and more states are rejecting the REAL ID Act. Fifteen other states in addition to Montana have enacted legislation opposing or refusing to implement the program.   The immigration bill only authorizes $1.5 billion for REAL ID, although estimates put the actual cost for states as high as $23 billion.   -30-

February 28, 2006
(Washington, D.C.) â U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt has accepted Montana Senator Max Baucus' invitation to attend a community meeting in Libby on Friday, March 10 to help address ongoing health care and redevelopment efforts following years of asbestos exposure by W.R. Grace.    
Baucus invited Secretary Leavitt to Libby to show the Bush Administration official firsthand the ""widespread and dire health care situation"" in the small northwestern Montana community. Baucus is asking Leavitt to help provide more resources for health care to residents who are sick from asbestos exposure.    
The trip will be Leavitt's second â he visited Libby at Baucus' request in 2004 as then-EPA Administrator. Baucus is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the health care agency. At Leavitt's confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee in February 2005, Baucus extracted a promise from Leavitt, a former Utah Governor, to visit to Libby again.    
Baucus has been working to, among other things, secure a commitment from HHS to invest greater resources in Libby, ensure that any asbestos bill in the Congress  provides Libby residents with the compensation they need and deserve, and establish a new research facility to develop innovative asbestos exposure treatment options.    
Baucus said he also wants to direct more federal resources to the Center for Asbestos Related Diseases, which he helped establish in 2000. The CARD clinic has done a good job providing health care and screening for Libby residents, he said, but noted additional federal dollars are needed to provide more and better care.    
""This is a great opportunity for Secretary Leavitt to see firsthand the devastation that W.R. Grace has inflicted on the people of Libby,"" Baucus said. ""I'm committed to doing all I can to help get Libby residents get the health care they need and deserve. Folks are dying in Libby. It's that simple. And we must do more to help them.""    
Since news reports first brought the tragedy in Libby to light in 1999, Baucus has helped secure millions of federal dollars for cleanup, health care, and economic development. He was the first high-ranking elected official to visit Libby in 2000, and the March 10 trip will be Baucus' 17th visit since then.    
Although Baucus said the March 10 schedule is still being finalized, a community meeting will be held at the Libby City Hall, Ponderosa Room, 2:30 p.m. MST. For further information, people are asked to contact Baucusâ Kalispell office at (406) 756-1150.

February 28, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - Montana's senior U.S. Senator Max Baucus, Tom Buis - President of the National Farmers Union and others today held a conference call with reporters to press for country-of-origin labeling to be implemented by September 30, 2007.    
Baucus is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on marketing, inspection, and product promotion, which has jurisdiction over COOL.     
In January, Baucus introduced a measure with Senator Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) that would make country-of-origin labeling mandatory on all meat products starting September 30, 2007 instead of September 30, 2008.    
""It's time for Congress to listen to the thousands of small packers, producers and consumers in Montana and around the country that want COOL now,"" said Baucus, the only member of the Montana delegation to sit on the Agriculture Committee. ""Montana producers have waited since the original COOL law was passed in the 2002 Farm bill to promote their products as, 'Made in the U.S.A.' It's time we implement COOL - we owe to all Montanans and Americans.""    
The Thomas-Baucus COOL bill has broad support from farm state senators from both parties. Senators Jon Tester (D-Mont.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Jeff Bingaman (R-N.M.), Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) also support the legislation. The National Farmers Union as well as 213 other agriculture organizations wrote Congress urging immediate COOL implementation.    
""Montanans have a right to know where the products they buy come from,"" Baucus said. ""I'm committed to working together with my colleagues to get COOL implemented the way it was intended - cost effectively without overburdening producers, packers or consumers.""    
The COOL legislation will go to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration, Baucus said and noted that he'll hold hearings on the bill in his subcommittee.

February 28, 2007
(Washington, D.C.) - At a press conference on Capitol Hill U.S. Senator Max Baucus today introduced the Endangered Species Recovery Act of 2007 (ESRA), which will provide tax incentives to help protect land and boost endangered species populations.    
Baucus, chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Finance Committee - the panel that has jurisdiction over all taxes - teamed up with Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) to introduce ESRA, which provides tax incentives for farmers, ranchers and private landowners who voluntarily agree to put easements on their property or agree to restore, enhance, or manage endangered species habitat on their land. Baucus said that the legislation introduced today will go through his committee - the Finance Committee - before going to the full Senate for its consideration.    
""Montana is an outdoors state,"" Baucus said. ""We hunt, we fish, we hike, we take our kids camping. I want to do my part to help ensure that our children and our children's children are able to take advantage of the great outdoors. That's why I introduced this legislation - to help protect our land and to help our endangered species too.""    
Baucus' Endangered Species Recovery Bill:  â¢	Farmers, ranchers and other eligible taxpayers may receive a tax credit if they own habitat or incur costs to recover endangered species.  â¢	Farmers, ranchers and other eligible taxpayers may enter into a perpetual conservation easement, a 30 year conservation easement or an agreement for a specific period of time.  â¢	Participating taxpayers will develop a management plan with schedule, deadline and monitoring and assistance for participating in the recovery program.    
Baucus' bill has broad support from both Republicans and Democrats as well as hunting and fishing groups - such as the Congressional Sportsmen Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense, the Defenders of Wildlife, the National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition (NESARC) and Farm Bureau.     
""By encouraging landowners to enter into these agreements, we can help protect Montana's outdoor heritage,"" Baucus said. ""I'm committed to working together with my colleagues to get this bill passed.""    
Baucus and Crapo are co-chairmen of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, which is a group of lawmakers who work to boost access for hunting and fishing across the country.

July 28, 2005
(WASHINGTON, D.C.)  U.S. Senator Max Baucus today hailed a committee vote to advance the Combat Meth Act, a measure that would, among other things, put cold and sinus products that have meth-making ingredients behind the counter.  
Baucus joined Sens. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) and Dianne Feinstein to sponsor the Combat Meth Act, which will curb meth production by moving pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, the primary ingredients of the drug, behind the pharmacy counter and require the products be sold only by a pharmacist or pharmacy technician, or approved alternative seller.  The bill would create a uniform federal floor for the regulation of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, with states allowed to set stricter standards if they choose. All states would be required to review their laws for compliance with the federal legislation. The Senates Judiciary Committee approved the measure today. The bill must now be considered by the full Senate. Because pseudophedrine and ephedrine are found in many over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines such as Sudafed, meth cooks can purchase, or steal the ingredient in large quantities. Similar legislation was passed by the Montana legislature. Putting meth ingredients like Sudafed behind the counter is a common-sense approach to fighting back against meth, said Baucus, who is leading Montanas meth fight in Congress. In all my years, Ive never seen a worse problem facing our close-knit Montana communities. We have to keep working together to crack down on crank. The Combat Meth Act will also provide additional resources to local law enforcement, expand the ability of local prosecutors to bring meth distributors to justice and increase awareness and involvement of businesses that legally sell pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. The bill makes critical funding available to states for additional equipment, training for law enforcement agents and prosecutors to bring legal action against meth offenders and clean-up meth labs, and provides grants to treat those affected by the drug.  
The measure will also help create a Methamphetamine Research, Training and Technical Assistance Center which will research effective treatments for meth abuse and disseminate information and technical assistance to states and private entities on how to improve current treatment methods. Methamphetamine is a powerful and highly addictive central nervous system stimulant that is associated with violence because it can cause paranoia, aggression, and mood swings. The byproducts of making meth are highly toxic and flammable and require specially trained personnel to clean them up.

November 28, 2006
Washington D.C.) â Montana Senator Max Baucus today urged the U.S. Forest Service to hold public meetings on a plan that could lead to campsite closures in Montana.    

The Forest Service is currently working on a facility site master plan, which is a comprehensive look at the nationâs recreation facilities and campsites. Because of budget constraints, Forest Service officials have said the agency is looking at possibly closing campsites as a way to save money. Baucus is concerned because the agency is not required by law to gather public input into these decisions, and he wants to give Montanans a chance to weigh in on the proposal.   

âIâm not going to let the Forest Service make decisions about our campgrounds without full public input and scrutiny,â? Baucus said. âLimiting access to our public lands for hunting, fishing, and camping is something Montanans donât take lightly.â?  

In a letter to Forest Service Region 1 Regional Forester Gail Kimbell, Baucus asked the agency to hold public meetings on each of Montanaâs nine National Forests.  

âMontanans must have opportunities to be involved in decisions that affect developed recreation areas, so that the result takes into account a wide variety of responsible uses,â? Baucus wrote today to Kimbell.  âWorking together with communities that rely on these sites, a long-term plan can be developed that ensures maximum access to well maintained, affordable recreation sites.  It is of the utmost concern to me that local voices be heard throughout this process.  That is why I am requesting that you hold public meetings to discuss these issues on each of Montanaâs nine National Forests.â?  

Baucus noted that public lands play a vital role in Montanaâs economy. Public lands in Montana provide jobs and recreation opportunities such as hiking, hunting, fishing and camping, Baucus said.   

âThe Forest Service needs to reach a solution that maintains maximum access to recreation facilities for Montanaâs outdoor enthusiasts,â? Baucus wrote to Kimbell. âWhile I fully understand current federal budget constraints, the Forest Service ought to strive to enhance access.  Any significant reduction in our developed recreation sites only undermines the Forest Serviceâs mission and our Montana heritage of hunting, fishing, and camping.  Preserving access to serviceable, developed recreation areas is a part of the Montana outdoors experience that we hope to pass on to future generations.â?  

Baucus has a long history of working to protect Montanaâs outdoor heritage for future generations to enjoy. Baucus has worked to expand public land access and has successfully fought proposals to sell off public lands to pay for other programs.  

Baucus said he will continue to work together with the Forest Service to ensure that Montanans get a say on how public lands are managed in the state.  
  Baucusâ letter to Kimbell is attached.  


November 28, 2006  

Ms. Abigail R. Kimbell  
Regional Forester  
USDA Forest Service, Region 1  
PO Box 7669  
Missoula, Montana 59807-7669  

Dear Gail:  

We pride ourselves on our outdoor heritage in Montana.  We are blessed with spectacular mountains, forests, and blue ribbon trout streams.  Public lands in Montana provide jobs and recreation for folks all across the state, and the facilities at the developed recreation sites are important to those users.  I strongly urge the Forest Service to take advantage of community input as they pursue revisions to recreation site master plans.  

As Montanans we value our public lands, and we want a say in how they are managed.  Updating the Forest Serviceâs recreation site facility master plans could result in significant changes to our National Forests.  Region 1 has approximately 1500 developed recreation facilities, and the majority of those are in Montana.  The recreation site facility master plans will determine which facilities to keep, close, or upgrade, as well as look at instituting or increasing user fees at certain sites.  

Montanans must have opportunities to be involved in decisions that affect developed recreation areas, so that the result takes into account a wide variety of responsible uses.  Working together with communities that rely on these sites, a long-term plan can be developed that ensures maximum access to well maintained, affordable recreation sites.  It is of the utmost concern to me that local voices be heard throughout this process.  That is why I am requesting that you hold public meetings to discuss these issues on each of Montanaâs nine National Forests.  

The Forest Service needs to reach a solution that maintains maximum access to recreation facilities for Montanaâs outdoor enthusiasts.  While I fully understand current federal budget constraints, the Forest Service ought to strive to enhance access.  Any significant reduction in our developed recreation sites only undermines the Forest Serviceâs mission and our Montana heritage of hunting, fishing, and camping.  Preserving access to serviceable, developed recreation areas is a part of the Montana outdoors experience that we hope to pass on to future generations.  

I look forward to seeing the results of public comment on this matter, and to working with your office as the process moves forward.  Please contact my office if I can be of assistance.  

With best personal regards, I am  


Sincerely,

  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., today made the following statement regarding the release of the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health Survey:
   ""Surveys of opinions about the new Medicare law, including today's Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health Survey, provide interesting figures that may become part of a political debate. But what is important is policy, not politics. The fact is that seniors enrolled in the new Medicare prescription drug discount card are getting real relief from the high cost of prescription drugs. And more help is on the way. 
   ""The programs enacted by the new law are already helping millions of seniors and Americans with disabilities, and these benefits will dramatically improve when the full benefit is implemented in 2006.
   ""Public officials who mislead seniors about their choices and benefits are part of the problem contributing to the unfortunate reality, confirmed in today's survey, that many seniors are confused about the new Medicare law and the benefits available to them, or that they simply don't know enough about its benefits. Seniors deserve to know the facts. Today's survey shows that we need to work together to provide them the information they need to take advantage of the real savings available under this landmark Medicare prescription drug benefit.""
   Facts about the Prescription Drug Program: 
   * 4 million Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in the new Medicare-endorsed prescription drug card program and 100,000 more are enrolling each week. 
   * Card holders average 17-24 percent savings on their prescription drugs (with some seniors saving as much as 89 percent) according to a July 28 Kaiser Family Foundation report. 
   * 7 million seniors are eligible for $1200 in direct assistance for prescription drug costs. 
   * Beginning in 2006, all seniors will have prescription drug coverage if they choose. 
   * $89 Billion will be provided to help retirees keep the benefits they have and like.

  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today joined Reps. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) and John J. Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.) in applauding the announcement by the Department of Homeland Security that a local site is a finalist for the location of a new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). 
   The site in Pulaski County, Ky., was nominated by the Kentucky/Tennessee NBAF Consortium, which partners the University of Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory with the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, and other university and industry partners.
   The new national lab will research biological threats involving human, zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. DHS estimates the facility will contain approximately 500,000 square feet of lab space, with construction costs running upwards of $450 million. Once operational, the facility is expected to directly support over 400 jobs with an annual payroll of $30.5 million. The effort to bring the facility to the region is supported by the governors and congressional delegations of both Tennessee and Kentucky.
   ""East Tennessee has a long tradition of research that benefits homeland security, and today's announcement brings us one step closer to adding to that impressive legacy,"" Frist said. ""Locating this research facility in the region would create jobs, benefit the local economy and further cement East Tennessee's standing as a one of the nation's premier scientific research communities. I commend the consortium for their efforts and will continue to work with them and the congressional delegation to bring this opportunity to the region.""
   ""This is very good news, and I am proud of the work in Tennessee and Kentucky that has gone into this effort,"" Alexander said. ""Tennessee's capabilities for performing innovative work in this area are unique and growing. I expect the proposal from the Kentucky-Tennessee partnership for siting this new national lab to be very competitive. I applaud Hal Rogers for his leadership at the federal level on this important effort.""
   ""The strong partnership of the University of Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory would give any consortium the strength to compete for a major mission in Homeland Security or research of this nature,"" Wamp said. ""I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Hal Rogers in putting these great institutions together. We are committed to this partnership and hope to stay competitive throughout this process.""
   ""We have many valuable scientific resources in our region and I am pleased that DHS recognizes East Tennessee's potential to further our nation's bio-defense research,"" said Duncan. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues and the consortium to bring this facility to our area.""
   DHS will continue to evaluate and conduct site visits to the 14 proposed sites and could announce a final selection early next year.

FRIST REFLECTS ON PASSING OF MENTOR, RENOWNED HEART SURGEON DR. NORM SHUMWAY
  World-renowned heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway passed away today at his home in California at the age of 83. Shumway was the first surgeon to perform a successful heart transplant in the United States. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. studied with Shumway at Stanford for two years beginning in 1985 before returning to Nashville, TN where he established a multi-organ transplant center at Vanderbilt University. The following are excerpts from Frist's reflections on Shumway's legacy as a world-class surgeon, teacher, mentor and friend: 
   ""Norman Shumway was the inspirational leader and guiding spirit who made heart transplants a reality. When all those around him said it could never happen his vision, his determination, his unrelenting commitment and pioneer spirit saved thousands of lives.  
   ""His gift was the rare blend of long-term thinking, a love of medicine and a true pioneering spirit that inspired and attracted like-minded individuals from across the country and around the world. 
   ""He was fond of remarking that his role as a surgeon was comparable to that of being the world's greatest second assistant, and his humble yet visionary work is now reflected in surgical programs all over the world. He loved his role as an assistant healer and cherished the opportunity to not only operate and innovate, but to share and teach. I've worked with a lot of cardiac surgeons and been in academic programs at Mass General (in Boston) and back at Vanderbilt and I think more than anybody that I interacted with over my 20 years doing it, Dr. Shumway was the one who has had the most, broadest influence on overall academic and clinical surgery because of his unparalleled commitment to teaching. 
   ""He was a pioneer because of the complexities involved in the operations, yet he was able to keep things accessible. One of his most common quotes was to remind us to keep it simple. ""If it looks complex, it's not right,"" he was fond of saying again and again. 
   ""Never be afraid to double dribble..."" What that meant to me as a surgeon, was if it is not perfect, put that second stitch in or remove it and put the first one in. If it takes 2 stitches that's what it takes - don't be afraid to do that instead of hotshotting it through the operation. 
   ""Shumway would look for somebody who had the genius, who had the entrepreneurial spirit, who was a free thinker and he would encourage them. He had this sort of 6th sense of attracting people who shared his pioneering spirit. 
   ""He would take people early on and give them the freedom to think creatively and with innovation. As a product of that, he attracted pioneering people and considered it part of his mission to nurture and cultivate that ambition and drive .... didn't matter what age you were, what your status was, didn't matter if you were a 1st year resident or a 5th year resident or an assistant professor, if you had a good idea, he would nurture it, he would encourage it, he would give you the freedom to explore. It was a very different mentality from Boston or New York where you are used to more traditional thinking..."" 
   ""If you had an idea, he would literally set up a little laboratory around you and encourage it. The inspiration and nurturing even extended beyond the field of medicine. Given the unique type of drive that inspired a person to study with Dr. Shumway, it was not unexpected when individuals found other challenging problems that may have been outside of the field of medicine. And when other challenges came along - and you showed the same spirit that drew you to Dr. Shumway in the first place, he nurtured it too. And you knew it was okay to take on those risks too because he said it was ok. 
   ""He was mentor. A great surgeon. And a true friend. I will miss him dearly.""

   ""Yesterday, China, Cuba and other countries with poor human rights records were elected by the UN General Assembly to the newly created Human Rights Council. This demonstrates the Council's failure to address the significant shortcomings of the widely discredited UN Commission on Human Rights. Freedom House has given these countries and others now on the Council a rating of 'not free,' and I find it troubling that some of the world's worst human rights abusers were able to obtain a seat on this body. 
   ""As I and many of my Senate colleagues have argued, the new Council makes only superficial changes to the former commission structure. The new Council cannot be taken seriously as a protector of human rights around the world when a number of its members have a long track record of egregious human rights abuses. As such, we cannot rely upon it to monitor human rights abuses throughout the world. 
   ""Today, I renew my call for the United States to establish a group of like-minded democracies with a demonstrated commitment to the protection of human rights in order to create an effective and accountable human rights oversight body outside the UN system. Even though the UN refuses to make real and substantive reforms, the United States must continue its principled leadership and its commitment to the protection of human rights. 
   ""In addition, the General Assembly's recent vote against UN reform efforts demonstrates that many member states are not serious about meaningful reform of the UN. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to renew their calls for a wide-scale overhaul of the UN. As it stands, the organization is fraught with corruption, inefficiency and waste. In order to restore its international credibility, the UN needs to change.""

  Today the office of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) released the following statement and fact sheet regarding consensus border security provisions: 
   To tackle immigration reform, Congress must act to secure the border, address workplace enforcement, and create a comprehensive system which respects the rule of law, acknowledges the country's economic needs, and honors our heritage as a nation of immigrants.  
   Every day Senators Reid and Schumer stand in the way of action in the Senate on immigration reform, America is less safe and less secure. Their politically motivated stunt should not prevent a bipartisan agreement to secure our borders. 
   An estimated 1.2 million people enter America illegally each year - for every person who is apprehended, three more enter successfully. In total, our illegal population grows by more than 500,000 annually. 
   Republican-backed legislation includes tough new provisions that will secure our borders and help state and local officials deal with the illegal population already in place.

   4. Authorize construction of additional ports of entry and improvements to existing ports of entry along the land borders. (Sec. 105)

  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today announced his intention to introduce legislation that would add North Korea to the list of countries covered by the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act:  
   ""Last week's missile launches by North Korea reminded us yet again of the threat posed by Kim Jong Il's regime. North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and its possession of long-range missiles that could potentially hit the U.S. is a grave threat to the security of the American people and to peace and stability in East Asia.""

For these reasons, I plan to introduce legislation that would add North Korea to the list of countries currently covered by the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act.""
   ""The U.S. must prevent North Korea from obtaining additional materials for its weapons and missile programs. These items in the hands of Kim Jong Il pose a direct threat to the American people and the people of the region. As part of an approach which includes multilateral diplomacy, this legislation can help stop the North Korean regime from acquiring these materials and provide added protection for the American homeland. The time has come for the United States to treat transfers of these items to North Korea no less seriously than we already treat transfers of these same items to Iran and Syria.""
   The Iran and Syria Non Proliferation Act was enacted in 2000 and originally applied only to Iran. It was amended in 2005 to extend to Syria as well. For countries that are covered by this law, the President is authorized to impose sanctions on any foreign person believed to have transferred to such countries goods, services, or technologies that could contribute to the ability to produce missiles, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Foreign persons who acquire such items from countries covered by the law are also subject to sanctions. In any case in which the President declines to impose sanctions on a foreign person who made a transfer covered by the law, he is required to explain to Congress why sanctions were not imposed. Among the sanctions that can be imposed on foreign persons who make such transfers are prohibitions on U.S. government procurement from such persons, and on the issuance of U.S. government export licenses for exports to such persons.

  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act (HIMMAA), which would allow small businesses to pool together to purchase affordable health insurance for their employees:  
   ""Today, Senate Republicans voted to provide affordable health insurance for millions of uninsured American workers. Senate Democrats should be ashamed of themselves for refusing to allow a vote on this important legislation that would help small businesses offer quality, affordable health coverage to their employees. 
   ""I appreciate the dedicated efforts of HELP Committee Chairman Mike Enzi and Senator Ben Nelson, two members who worked together across the partisan divide to address this vital issue. 
   ""With 46 million uninsured Americans, our nation is confronting a monumental health insurance crisis. Skyrocketing health care costs have meant many small businesses simply can't afford to provide health insurance to their employees. Small business health plans would move a significant segment of the uninsured population to the ranks of the insured, but despite numerous requests to work together, Democrats have once again put partisan politics ahead of doing what is right for working Americans."" 
   Only 53 percent of Tennessee's private sector employers offer health insurance. Nearly 1 million Tennesseans work for small businesses and would benefit if their employers were able to join together to purchase quality, affordable health care. 
   Of the 20 million working Americans without health insurance, 49 percent are self-employed or work in firms with fewer than 25 employees. By contrast, 98 percent of companies with 200 or more employees offer health benefits.
  A recent study estimates HIMMAA would lower insurance premiums by 12 percent, resulting in savings of up to $1,000 per employee and reducing the number of uninsured workers by nearly 8 percent.

  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement after the Senate passed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 conference report:  
   ""I'm particularly pleased that Senator Grassley, Congressman Thomas, Senator Kyl and the conference committee heeded my calls for extending alternative minimum tax relief and for keeping rates low on capital gains and dividends. This legislation prevents a $70 billion tax increase on the American people and ensures continued economic growth and job creation. These provisions have proven to strengthen our economy and help provide an environment conducive to small business investment and growth. 
   ""Republican tax cuts have helped create 5.3 million new jobs since 2003, driven down unemployment rates to record lows and stimulated 18 consecutive quarters of growth. Working Americans deserve the full support of Congress. By keeping taxes low, we're helping Americans everywhere find and keep jobs. We're supporting our families and our communities, and we're ensuring America remains a great place to live and do business."" 
   Tennesseans received a number of benefits as a result of the bill's passage: 143,000 taxpayers in the state will qualify for AMT relief; 323,000 families (13 percent of all Tennessee taxpayers) will qualify for the reduced capital gains tax; and 428,000 families (17 percent of all Tennessee taxpayers) will qualify for the reduced dividend tax. For both capital gains and dividends taxes, about one-third of the beneficiaries are families with an adjusted gross income of less than $30,000. 
   In addition, Frist secured two provisions in the legislation increasing the tax code's fairness for songwriters. The first allows songwriters to claim the capital gains tax rate on music sales and will reduce songwriters' taxes by up to 35 percent. Individual songwriters can pay up to 50 percent in income and self-employment taxes on their music under current law while their corporate partners just pay 15 percent in capital gains taxes. 
   The second songwriter provision simplifies the accounting process for advances paid to songwriters. Songwriting advances can now be calculated according to a straight-line, three-year depreciation schedule.

DASCHLE WINS FIGHT FOR IMPORTANT TAX INCENTIVES FOR ETHANOL
  The U.S. Senate passed a massive tax credit and jobs bill today that includes key incentives for the ethanol industry that will mean thousands of jobs for South Dakota, and millions of dollars in revenue for South Dakota farmers. The legislation, known as the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) bill, includes the extension of the ethanol excise tax incentive, expansion of the small ethanol producer tax credit, and important biodiesel tax incentives. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle co-authored the ethanol and biodiesel incentives included in the bill, cosponsored the legislation, and helped negotiate the final bill with the House of Representatives. The measure now goes to the President to be signed into law. 
   ""Ethanol production is one of the most important engines of economic growth in South Dakota,"" Daschle said. ""The ethanol provisions included in the FSC bill will expand ethanol production for many years to come, boosting farm income and stimulating economic growth in rural communities.""
   The FSC bill includes extended incentives for ethanol producers, as well as new incentives for the expanded production of biodiesel. The bill extends the current ethanol excise tax incentive set to expire in 2008 to December 31, 2010. The extension means economic security for thousands of South Dakota farmers, and helps to attract the capital investment needed to build new plants and expand ethanol production.
   The 5.2-cents-per-gallon tax break on ethanol-blended fuels makes them competitive at the pump, meaning more and more Americans will use ethanol gasoline, further bolstering the South Dakota ethanol market and expanding the industry.
   ""Increased ethanol production is not only good for South Dakota farmers and the rural communities that depend on it,"" Daschle said, ""It will also help us to become more energy independent, by reducing America's reliance on Middle East oil.""
   The FSC bill also includes important biodiesel tax incentives that will promote the construction of many more biodiesel facilities across country.
   ""Furthering ethanol production and expanding our ethanol facilities is something I have been working on for more than 25 years in the Congress,"" Daschle said. ""This latest victory for South Dakota means a boost for our rural economies, a boost for our South Dakota farmers, and an excellent outlook for ethanol in the years to come.""

  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.), made the following statement today regarding border security provisions included in S.2612, a comprehensive immigration reform bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and cosponsored by Sens. Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), that address key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission:
   ""To make America safer and more secure, Senator Reid needs to stop clogging up the Senate with procedural gimmicks and let Members have fair up and down votes on amendments so the Senate can act on a strong and balanced immigration bill that addresses dangerous flaws in our border security system identified by the 9/11 Commission. Every day he stalls, we are less safe and less secure."" 
   S.2612
   Addressing Key Recommendations By The 9/11 Commission
   1. The 9/11 Commission: ""Our investigation showed that two systemic weaknesses came together in our border system's inability to contribute to an effective defense against the 9/11 attacks: a lack of well-developed counter-terrorism measures as a part of border security and an immigration system not able to deliver on its basic commitments, much less support counter-terrorism. These weaknesses have been reduced but are far from being overcome."" (Page 384)
   * S.2612 addresses the second weakness by giving the border security and immigration system the tools it needs to deliver on its basic commitment to secure America's borders against those who would seek to enter illegally.
   2. The 9/11 Commission: ""Better technology and training to detect terrorist travel documents are the most important immediate steps to reduce America's vulnerability to clandestine entry . . . . Information systems able to authenticate travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at consulates, at primary border inspection lines, in immigration services offices, and in intelligence and enforcement units. All frontline personnel should receive some training."" (Page 385)
   * S.2612 requires that all immigration inspectors receive training in identifying and detecting fraudulent travel documents and obtain access to the Forensic Document Laboratory.
   S.2612 requires that immigration-status documents issued by DHS be machine-readable, tamper-resistant, and incorporate biometric identifiers by October 26, 2007.
   3. The 9/11 Commission: ""The current patchwork of border screening systems, including several frequent traveler programs, should be consolidated with the USVISIT system to enable the development of an integrated system, which in turn can become part of the wider screening plan we suggest."" (Page 388)
   S.2612 requires the Secretary of DHS, by October 1, 2007, to enhance the connectivity between the Automated Biometric Fingerprint Identification System and Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System biometric database and collect all fingerprints from individuals through the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program during their initial enrollment.
   S.2612 requires the Secretary of DHS to submit to Congress a timeline for equipping all land border ports of entry with the US-VISIT system, deploying at all land border ports of entry the exit component of the US-VISIT system, and making all immigration screening systems interoperable.
   4. The 9/11 Commission: ""Completion of the entry-exit system is a major and expensive challenge. Biometrics have been introduced into an antiquated computer environment. Replacement of these systems and improved biometric systems will be required. Nonetheless, funding and completing a biometrics-based entry-exit system is an essential investment in our national security."" (Page 389)
   * S.2612 authorizes DHS to collect biometric data from any alien or lawful permanent resident seeking admission to, exit from, transit through, or paroled into the U.S., and provides that failure to comply with the biometric requirements is a ground for inadmissibility.
   5. The 9/11 Commission: ""It is elemental to border security to know who is coming into the country. Today more than 9 million people are in the United States outside the legal immigration system. We must also be able to monitor and respond to entrances between our ports of entry, working with Canada and Mexico as much as possible."" (Page 390).
   S.2612 gives DHS the resources it needs to focus on entrances between ports of entry by adding 250 new Custom and Border Protection officers and 4,400 additional border patrol agents, giving DHS unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, sensors and other technologies to achieve operational control of the border, the authority to construct all-weather roads and add vehicle barriers, the authority to maintain temporary or permanent border patrol checkpoints in close proximity to the southern border and authorizes construction of additional ports of entry.
   S.2612 requires Secretaries of State, DHS and Defense to determine how best to improve the exchange of information among the United States, Mexico, and Canada on matters related to the security of North America, including how to coordinate security clearances, immigration and visa management, visa policy, counter-terrorism and terrorist watch lists, and law enforcement cooperation.
   6. The 9/11 Commission: ""There is a growing role for state and local law enforcement agencies. They need more training and work with federal agencies so that they can cooperate more effectively with those federal authorities in identifying terrorist suspects. (Page 390)""
   S.2612 requires DHS to pay for training for state and local law enforcement on how to identify, process, and when appropriate, detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity.
   S.2612 reaffirms that even State law enforcement personnel without specialized training still retain the inherent authority to assist the federal government in enforcing the immigration laws of the United States during the normal course of carrying out their law enforcement duties.
   S.2612 requires DHS to provide sufficient transportation and officers to take all illegal aliens apprehended by State and local law enforcement officers into custody for processing at a DHS detention facility.

  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) released today the following joint statement regarding the border security bill: 
   ""America is a nation with borders and borders matter. We are a nation of citizens and citizenship matters. We are also a nation of laws and laws matter. We have an important immigrant heritage and honoring that heritage matters.
   ""In December, the House of Representatives passed a strong border security bill aimed at securing our borders and preventing illegal immigration.
   ""However, on December 16, 2005, there were 191 House Democrats who voted to oppose House Republican efforts to reduce the crime of unlawful presence in the United States from a felony to a misdemeanor. Instead, they voted to make felons out of all of those who remain in our country illegally.
   ""While we are disappointed with the House Democrat's lack of compassion and the continued efforts by Senator Reid to block action on immigration legislation so that Congress can proceed to conference, it remains our intent to produce a strong border security bill that will not make unlawful presence in the United States a felony.""

  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for awarding $17.8 million to Tennessee through the Access to Recovery Program.  
 The funding will be distributed to the state over three years to enhance substance abuse clinical treatment and recovery support services. 
   ""Substance abuse can be a long, often uphill battle that requires significant treatment and recovery support,"" said Frist. ""This funding will help Tennessee increase the treatment and recovery options available to Tennesseans, allowing those who need help and their families to choose high quality, effective and appropriate care.""
   ""This is important funding that will provide quality support for countless Tennesseans who are overcoming substance abuse problems. Keeping our state drug-free means healthier children, stronger families and safer communities,"" said Alexander. ""Senator Frist and I appreciate the Department of Health and Human Services' investment in Tennessee."" 
   The Access to Recovery Program is part of HHS' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Tennessee will be awarded $5.9 million per year for three years for a total of approximately $17.8 million. 
   The goal of the Tennessee program is to lower substance abuse cases by supplying vouchers for assessment, substance abuse clinical treatment and/or recovery services. The program will provide client choice among substance abuse clinical treatment and recovery support providers while expanding access to service options, including faith-based options, and increasing the number of state-authorized substance abuse providers.

  The Udall Foundation is an executive branch agency. The President of the United States appoints its board of trustees with the approval of the U.S. Senate. The Foundation's activities are supported by two distinct funds in the U.S. Treasury. Educational activities are supported primarily by interest generated from a trust fund established by Congress, as well as private donations for educational activities. The activities of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, which provides assessment, mediation, facilitation and related services to assist in resolving federal environmental conflicts, are supported by annual appropriations and fees charged for services.

   The Morris K. Udall Foundation was established by Congress in 1992 to support educational activities on the environment, Native American health and tribal policy, and effective public policy conflict resolution. It was named after former Congressman Morris King Udall, who served 30 years in the House of Representatives and was a recognized leader on environmental preservation and Native American policy. 
   The Udall Foundation is an executive branch agency. The President of the United States appoints its board of trustees with the approval of the U.S. Senate. The Foundation's activities are supported by two distinct funds in the U.S. Treasury. Educational activities are supported primarily by interest generated from a trust fund established by Congress, as well as private donations for educational activities. The activities of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, which provides assessment, mediation, facilitation and related services to assist in resolving federal environmental conflicts, are supported by annual appropriations and fees charged for services.

FRIST RALLIES SENIORS' SUPPORT AT MEDICARE DRUG DISCOUNT CARD WORKSHOPS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today joined medical professionals, community leaders, consumer advocates and seniors in Chattanooga and Knoxville to rally support for Medicare-approved prescription drug discount cards that are saving seniors thousands of dollars on prescription drugs. The workshop provided an opportunity for seniors to learn more about the savings and assistance available to them under the new Medicare program and to help seniors enroll in a discount card that best meets their prescription drug needs.  
   ""Until Congress passed and President Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act last year, seniors were denied Medicare coverage for one of the most powerful tools in medicine today- prescription drugs. Now, with Medicare-approved drug discount cards, seniors can begin saving today,"" said Frist. ""Government and independent studies have shown that Medicare drug cards are providing significant savings. One recent study shows that seniors in Chattanooga and Knoxville can receive between 19 and 37 percent off retail prices. Today's workshops are an opportunity for seniors to learn more about the savings available to them and to work hands-on with experts to choose the best card for them."" 
   The sessions hosted by Senator Frist included participants from the local Agencies on Aging, prominent medical and senior citizen organizations, local physicians, nurses, and others. The federal Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was on hand, along with trained experts, to answer seniors' questions about selecting a Medicare-approved prescription drug discount card. 
   In Tennessee, more than 670,000 seniors and people with disabilities are eligible for the new drug discount card program. There are a number of card choices available so that Medicare beneficiaries in the state can choose the one that best fits their needs. Of those who are eligible, more than 200,000 seniors with fixed incomes qualify for additional assistance up to $1,200 to use as cash on top of the discount prices. 
   ""It is important that seniors with lower incomes enroll as soon as possible so they can receive the maximum assistance,"" Frist added. 
   Those unable to attend the events in person, can compare prices and discount drug card options on the CMS website, www.medicare.gov. They can also call an operator at 1-800-MEDICARE to get more information and to sign up for a card. 
   There are more than 40 million Medicare beneficiaries nationally, including 873,000 in Tennessee. Of those, around 238,000 do not have any prescription drug coverage. 
   Senator Frist is also sponsoring similar workshops in Bristol, Nashville, Jackson and Memphis this week. 
   Frist has been a champion of Medicare reform for more than six years. He served on the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and has spearheaded a number of bipartisan legislative initiatives to modernize Medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit.

FRIST TOUTS ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 108TH CONGRESS
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today highlighted some of the achievements of the 108th Congress and the benefits for Tennessee. 
   ""During the 108th Congress, the Senate passed the most far reaching reforms of Medicare since its inception almost 40 years ago, the most comprehensive reforms of the intelligence community in over 50 years, the third largest tax relief package in our nation's history, all while strengthening our security at home and abroad,"" said Frist. ""I look forward to doing even more for Tennessee families in the 109th Congress.""  
   * Medicare: Delivered on its promise to America's seniors, with landmark legislation to guarantee Medicare beneficiaries access to more affordable medicine, better health care choices, and higher quality care. All 870,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Tennessee will have access to a prescription drug benefit beginning in January 2006. Until then, Tennessee beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare-approved prescription drug discount cards, offering savings of 10 to 25 percent off retail drug prices. Low-income Tennesseans will receive a $600 annual subsidy in extra assistance to help pay for prescription drugs. 
   * Intelligence Reform: Most comprehensive national security reforms since 1947. Contains a number of key provisions that are consistent with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and addresses fundamental issues facing America's intelligence agencies. Creates a national counter-proliferation center that makes America much safer against the threat of terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. 
   * War On Terror Supplemental: Approved $87 billion to support America's military and foreign operations programs. Provides funding for equipment and military construction projects that support America's troops in the global War on Terror. 
   * The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003: Resulted in $97 million in 2003 and an additional $97 million this year in funds for the State of Tennessee to use for ""essential government services and to pay for federal mandates."" From that same package, an additional $264 million will be provided for Medicaid for 2003 and $193 million for 2004. More than 1.7 million Tennesseans paid less in taxes due to passage of this act, which cut tax rates and increased the child tax credit. 
   * The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004: Extends the marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit as well as ensures that the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) will not affect more middle-income families. The bill also allows military families to include tax-free combat pay when calculating their refundable child credit and earned income tax credit will, in many instances, increase the credits to which they are entitled. 
   * The ""Jumpstart our Business Strength"" or JOBS Act (FSC-ETI repeal): Includes $76 billion of tax relief for the U.S.-based manufacturing sector to stimulate economic growth and promote new factory jobs. The centerpiece of this legislation is a three-point tax rate cut for manufacturing that occurs in the United States. In addition, the JOBS bill reforms many of the tax code's complicated international provisions to level the playing field for U.S. companies and allow U.S. manufacturers to better compete in the global market. Finally, the JOBS bill is revenue neutral; it will not add a single dollar to the federal deficit but will help reduce the deficit through economic growth. 
   * State Sales Tax Deductibility: Allows the deductibility of state sales tax for states which do not impose a state income tax. Almost of one-quarter of Tennesseans filing their taxes for 2004 could save an average of $470 on their taxes. 
   * Tobacco Buyout: Ends the outdated quota system that was hurting our farmers and provides fair compensation for quota owners and growers. In total, it will bring $767 million to Tennessee's tobacco communities over the next 10 years which will help the entire state's economy. 
   * The Global HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Assistance: Authorizes $15 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The President will establish a comprehensive, integrated, five-year strategy to combat the global spread of HIV and AIDS. 
   * The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003: Bans partial-birth abortions - a procedure in which a living fetus of 20 weeks gestation or more is partially delivered before being deliberately killed. The law bans this atrocious practice and is consistent with the Supreme Court's past rulings on abortion issues. 
   * The Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act: Authorizes $25 million in new resources for efforts to increase donation, including providing help to cover travel and other expenses for people who make living donations of organs; increasing public education about organ donation; and providing peer reviewed grants for studies and demonstration projects to increase organ donation and recovery rates. 
   * Bioterrorism: Project Bioshield authorizes $5.6 billion over 10 years for the development of vaccines and other countermeasures against biological attacks with smallpox, anthrax and botulism toxin, as well as other dangerous pathogens, such as Ebola and plague. 
   * Children's Health: The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 gives the Food and Drug Administration authority to require makers of drugs and biological products to conduct tests specifically to assess such product's safety and effectiveness for children, including proper dosage. 
   * The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2003: Provides an additional $2 billion per year for IDEA, and is designed to protect the educational rights of children with disabilities while also giving school districts more flexibility to address the special needs of these students. 
   * The Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act: Shuts down excess taxpayer subsidies to student loan providers and uses the money to help poor schools address a shortage of qualified teachers in math, science, and special education. The savings from this change to current law will be used to raise, from $5,000 to $17,500, the maximum amount of student loan debt that may be forgiven for certain highly qualified math, science, and special education teachers. 
   * The No Child Left Behind Act: Continues to provide historic new funding for Tennessee schools. For 2003, Tennessee received $3.4 million and for 2004, Tennessee is estimated to receive $3.68 million in federal support. This represents a 64 percent increase in federal K-12 education funds from 2002. 
   * Crime Prevention: The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act will allow thousands of well-equipped and well-trained police officers to continually serve and protect our communities by allowing qualified, off-duty retired police officers to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the United States.
  * Consumer Rights: The Do-Not-Call Registry allows all Americans to block unwanted telemarketing calls by signing up with the national registry. Already over 800,000 Tennessee phone numbers have been registered. 
   * U.S. Australian Free Trade Agreement: Expected to produce an increase in $2 billion annually in trade for both nations by 2010 creating as many as 40,000 jobs. Last year, Tennessee companies exported $225 million to Australia, a 10 percent increase from 1999. This agreement also includes a specific provision that classifies Tennessee whiskey as a product that is exclusively manufactured in Tennessee. 
   * Fort Campbell and Clarksville-Montgomery Schools: Secured almost $120 million to fund the construction of critical facilities and infrastructure at Fort Campbell. Also secured $4 million to help the Clarksville-Montgomery County School System plan for the additional 1,000 students that will result from 850 newly assigned soldiers at Fort Campbell, and $10 million to construct a new 80,000 square-foot Wings of Liberty Museum. 
   * City of Jackson (Disaster Assistance): Secured almost $11 million for Jackson to rebuild public housing due to the tremendous loss suffered by area residents during the May 2003 tornadoes. 
   * Memphis Biotech Foundation: Secured $4 million in 2004 to support the Memphis Biotech Foundation's effort to establish Memphis and the Mid-South region as a world leader in the biomedical industry. 
   * Memphis International Airport & National Guard Land Exchange: Facilitated land exchange agreement with Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority, FedEx, and the National Guard to allow the 164th Airlift Wing to build almost $200 million in new facilities and permit FedEx to expand its operations at the Memphis hub. The land exchange will create jobs and economic growth in the Mid-South. 
   * Tennessee Economic Growth: In the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Conference Report, secured more than $30 million for West Tennessee projects, $13 million for Middle Tennessee and $10 million for East Tennessee projects to create jobs, spur the economy and encourage business growth throughout the state.

   ""I applaud President Bush's pledge to contribute American $1.7 billion in aid-the largest contribution of all donor countries-to the reconstruction process in southern Sudan. However, the Sudanese government in Khartoum must take credible, assertive steps to end the genocide occurring in Darfur, meet its obligations under the peace agreement recently signed with the south, and ensure access for humanitarian aid personnel working in Darfur and trying to save lives. 
   ""These donations to southern Sudan's reconstruction efforts demonstrate the international community's commitment to the people of Sudan and their desire for peace and security following decades of war.

   ""The accidental shipment of the deadly H2N2 flu virus is just another in a string of occurrences which underscores the need to bolster America's domestic and global public health infrastructure. As strains grow resistant and immunities expire, or viruses reassort becoming more lethal and transmissible, we are at greater risk for a potential pandemic outbreak, as these viruses are only a plane ride away. Meanwhile, unnecessary litigation continues to destabilize our vaccine supply by causing fewer vaccines to be developed and produced. Vaccine shortages threaten our children and the health of our nation. 
   ""Last year's shortage of the flu vaccine exposed America's vulnerability to a potential outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. And the extensive and necessary precautionary measures taken to prevent the spread of the H2N2 virus highlight the need to move forward with legislative solutions. We must strengthen our domestic vaccine supply, expand legal protections, encourage collaboration between the public and private sectors, and advance research and development. These initiatives, while long overdue, enhance our public health infrastructure, stabilize the vaccine industry, and protect the public health. 
   ""On Monday, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the polio vaccine. We must build off of that historic success to strengthen America's preparedness against diseases of the future - our lives and the lives of future generations depend upon it.""

   ""Just two weeks ago, millions of Iraqis defied the threats of terrorists and went to the polls to determine their own future. I congratulate the Iraqi people for the courage they've shown in making these elections so successful. While the outcome must still be reviewed and certified, this was an historic step on the path to democracy for all Iraqis. After decades of oppression, this election establishes a credible process for governing Iraq in which all communities are represented, minority rights are respected, and violence is not tolerated. 
   ""I'm encouraged by Sunni leaders that are seeking a role in the drafting of Iraq's constitution, and by Shiite leaders who're also talking about the need for an open process that engages all parties. This inclusiveness is the essence of democracy. We're witnessing the transformational power of liberty. And I look forward to working with the newly elected Iraqi leaders as they continue on their journey towards freedom.""

   ""The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has brought hope, jobs and a future to hundreds of thousands of Africans, and I commend the President for signing this important extension of that legislation into law. The AGOA Acceleration Act (AGOA III) builds upon and furthers that much-needed and valued policy.
   ""This is a win-win situation for the United States, Africa and the world. Not only has AGOA created new investment and opportunity for U.S. businesses, it has helped create an estimated 150,000 African jobs, pump more than $340 million into African economies, and forge a place for Africa in the global trade market. I hope other countries will look to the success of this program and reexamine their trade preferences toward Africa and the benefits of trade relations in the region.""

Funding for a number of critical water infrastructure projects was also included in the bill.  
   ""This bill helps preserve and protect many of the cherished natural resources that shape Tennessee's distinctive character,"" said Frist. ""And I'm proud that at a time when funding is limited, the committee regarded these projects as worthy of inclusion in this bill. This bill increases funding for the operation of the National Park System and provides specific monies for several projects in Tennessee's national parks, wildlife refuges, and forests. Support is also provided for several water infrastructure projects that will have a major impact on local communities and their efforts to improve clean drinking water and wastewater services."" 
   ""I believe that there is nothing more central to the American character than the Great American Outdoors,"" said Alexander. ""We must do all we can to preserve our national parks and wildlife refuges for future generations to enjoy. This bill makes those investments while also investing in valuable water treatment centers and water conservation projects that will ensure cleaner drinking water for thousands of Tennesseans. Senator Frist and I will continue working to conserve Tennessee's natural resources."" 
   Funding for specific Tennessee initiatives include: 
   EAST TENNESSEE 
   * $1.8 million to acquire the Wauhatchie tract at the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Acquisition of this property will consolidate land in a historically important and popular visitor spot, and ensure the continued integrity of the Civil War battlefield experience. 
   * $500,000 for the University of Tennessee at Knoxville Natural Resources Policy Center to address natural and water resource management issues in the Southeast. 
   * $1 million for the Watauga River Regional Water Authority in Carter County to provide new clean drinking water services. 
   * $1 million for the City of Oak Ridge to support the West End Water and Wastewater Infrastructure project which will enhance wastewater treatment and drinking water facilities. 
   MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
   * $1.4 million for acquisition of the Walls of Jericho, which is located on the south Cumberland Plateau along the Tennessee and Alabama border. It is considered one of the most unique and biologically diverse areas in the Southeast United States. Preservation of the Walls of Jericho will ensure that the public can enjoy this remarkably scenic and fragile area for generations to come. 
   * $1 million for the Lake Tansi Sewer project in Cumberland County, which will support new wastewater infrastructure for approximately 1,600 homes. 
   * $400,000 for the Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area. The Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area is a statewide partnership between the National Park Service and Middle Tennessee State University. It is the only statewide National Heritage Area, as well as the only National Heritage Area administered by a public university in the nation. 
   WEST TENNESSEE 
   * $500,000 to support the Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee Regional Aquifer Study (MATRAS) through the U.S. Geological Survey and $500,000 to support the Groundwater Institute at the University of Memphis through the Environmental Protection Agency. Funding will support ongoing efforts to help determine how to manage the region's unique groundwater aquifer as a sustainable resource. 
   * $500,000 for the Chickasaw National Wildlife Refuge to acquire land within the existing boundary of the refuge that contain significant amounts of mature bald cypress. Preservation of these lands is essential to protecting naturally occurring habitats of the Lower Mississippi River Valley ecosystem. 
   * $7 million for the U.S. Forest Service International Program, an increase of $500,000 over last year's funding level, which supports a number of conservation programs at the Memphis Zoo. 
   The bill recommends a $64.9 million increase over last year's enacted level to continue to meet the Administration's commitment to maintaining our National Park System. 
   The legislation must now be considered and approved by the full United States Senate.

  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today met with President Bush and the leaders of five African countries-Botswana, Ghana, Niger, Mozambique, and Namibia-to discuss America's continuing efforts to help African nations improve their economies, implement political reforms, invest in social services and confront humanitarian emergencies on the continent. This meeting followed President Bush's announcement that the African Growth and Opportunity Act forum will be held this July in Senegal. Frist made the following statement after the meeting:  
   ""Today's announcement of next month's African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Conference in Senegal reflects President Bush's ongoing commitment to helping the nations of Africa improve their economies, implement needed reforms, and combat disease and hunger. Combined with this weekend's G-8 announcement of $40 billion in debt relief, and America's commitment last week of an additional $674 million in emergency aid, these initiatives provide hope and momentum to help the world's poorest countries, many of which are in Africa. 
   ""The announcements last week and this weekend demonstrate America's commitment to providing aid to the developing world. However, these dollars are tied to the promise of genuine economic and political reforms. Pledges of financial support are only a first step in the process of revitalizing this war-ravaged and poverty-stricken continent; they must be matched by authentic and visible efforts to root out corruption, protect human rights, promote the rule of law and build a stable and civil society. 
   ""I applaud President Bush for his vision and leadership in directly confronting challenging issues that will improve the lives of millions of men, women and children. And I look forward to seeing these dollars spur a movement towards economic and political change on the continent that will bring real and tangible benefits to all African citizens."" 
   Senator Frist travels regularly throughout Africa to get a first-hand look at the crises confronting many countries, including genocide in Sudan and the spread of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to practice medicine. 
   The United States is committed to eliminating poverty, expanding the circle of development and prosperity, and strengthening domestic institutions to sustain development in Africa. The U.S. is the world's single largest source of development assistance, providing 20 percent of all assistance from the developed nations. The United States provided $2.4 billion - 40 percent of the world total - for global disaster relief assistance in 2004. The U.S. is the largest single contributor to most international organizations, such as the World Bank. And the U.S. provides 60 percent of the funding for the World Food Program, the world's largest distributor of food globally.

  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) made the following announcement today regarding the administration's request for $75 million in the Supplemental spending bill to fund democracy, broadcasting, and education and outreach programs targeted at Iran:  
   ""The world's preeminent state-sponsor of terrorism cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. This would present a grave threat to the United States, the region, and to our ally Israel. I commend the administration and our European allies for moving the case of Iran's illicit nuclear activities firmly out of the IAEA Board of Governors to the United Nation's Security Council. It is now time for the Security Council to act and to do so swiftly and decisively. 
   ""But while that process moves forward at the U.N., the United States must reach out to the Iranian people and make clear that we support them, that we believe democracy is the way out of oppression, and that we are eager for a better relationship with them. That is why I fully support the administration's supplemental request for $75 million for democracy, broadcasting, and education and outreach programs. 
   ""These programs aim to promote democratic participation and foster political organization inside Iran, increase our radio and television broadcasting capabilities into Iran, support the development of independent television and radio programming in Iran, and expand our outreach to Iranian students and visitors through educational and cultural ties. It is my understanding that the House Appropriations Committee has acted to reduce this funding. I will fight to ensure the entire amount requested is provided. 
   ""The Iranian people are a great people with a remarkable heritage and culture. It is a shame that the inept and ruthless theocracy that governs them has isolated the country and exacerbated their economic woes. It is critical that we stop Iran's nuclear activities, and the UN is the proper forum to do this right now. But we must work at the same time to help the Iranian people and to talk with them about what democracy and freedom can bring them."" 
   The administration's $75 million Supplemental request for Iran includes $50 million to increase and improve America's television and radio broadcasting capabilities in Iran; $15 million to support Iranian civic education and foster political organization and participation through U.S. organizations such as the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, and the National Endowment for Democracy; $5 million for educational and cultural exchange programs for Iranian students; and $5 million for internet and other media efforts to reach the Iranian public.

  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement after the Secretary of Defense released his recommendations for closure and realignment of military installations:

By law, the decisions and recommendations must be made based strictly on the merits of each facility's military value. And though the final outcome of this process may be difficult, I expect that affected military personnel, their families, and nearby communities will receive needed support and transition assistance resulting from any base realignments or closures. 
   ""I'm confident the commission will make an honest and comprehensive assessment that will promote military readiness and deliver cost-savings to American taxpayers. And I intend to follow the commission's progress closely over the coming months. 
   ""While Tennessee stands to gain considerably from the Pentagon's recommendations, I'm particularly concerned about the impact of the Pentagon's recommendations regarding the outstanding facilities and superb personnel serving at Nashville's Air National Guard Base and Kingsport's Army Reserve facility. We must also be mindful of the communities that may be impacted by any changes at those bases and help those whose jobs may be affected. I'm hopeful that as the BRAC commission considers these recommendations, they consider the option of realigning the units and aircraft at Nashville's Air National Guard Base to Ft. Campbell, rather than out of state. I'll work hard to ensure the full value and merits of these facilities, and the unyielding support they receive from the surrounding community, are taken into consideration before any final decisions are made, and that the personnel and units are treated fairly in any final outcome."" 
   The Base Realignment and Closure Commission is an independent body charged with reviewing the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense regarding closure or realignment of military installations to suit the needs of America's armed forces. Over the coming months, the commission will review today's recommendations by visiting sites and evaluating the Secretary's recommendations. If necessary, the commission will modify the list and put forward its recommendations to the President no later than September 8, 2005. 
   The Department of Defense estimates that this BRAC round could yield approximately $7 billion in annual savings. Resources can be reallocated to high priority demands including modernizing weapons, improving readiness and enhancing quality of life resources for troops. Previous BRAC rounds have saved over $17.7 billion in net revenue.

FRIST TO TAKE UP JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS ISSUE
  Statement from the office of the Senate Majority Leader:
   Upon completion of action on the pending highway bill, the Senate will begin debate on fair up or down votes on judicial nominations. As is the regular order, the Leader will move to act on judge nominations sent to the full Senate by the Judiciary Committee in the past several weeks. Priscilla Owen, to serve as a judge for the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, and Janice Rogers Brown, to serve as a judge for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, will be the nominees of focus.  
   The Majority Leader will continue to discuss an appropriate resolution of the need for fair up or down votes with the Minority Leader. If they can not find a way for the Senate to decide on fair up or down votes on judicial nominations, the Majority Leader will seek a ruling from the Presiding Officer regarding the appropriate length of time for debate on such nominees. After the ruling, he will ensure that every Senator has the opportunity to decide whether to restore the 214-year practice of fair up or down votes on judicial nominees; or, to enshrine a new veto by filibuster that both denies all Senators the opportunity to advise and consent and fundamentally disturbs the separation of powers between the branches. 
   There will be a full and vigorous Senate floor debate that is too important for parliamentary tactics to speed it up or slow it down until all members who wish have had their say. All members are encouraged to ensure that rhetoric in this debate follows the rules, and best traditions, of the Senate. 
   It is time for 100 Senators to decide the issue of fair up or down votes for judicial nominees after over two years of unprecedented obstructionism. The Minority has made public threats that much of the Senate's work will be shut down. Such threats are unfortunate. 
   The Majority Leader has proposed his Fairness Rule: up to 100 hours of debate, and then an up or down vote on circuit and Supreme Court nominations. Further, the Fairness Rule would eliminate the opportunity for blockade of such nominees at the Judiciary Committee. And finally, it will make no changes to the legislative filibuster. 
   If Senators believe a nominee is qualified, they should have the opportunity to vote for her. If they believe she is unqualified, they should have the opportunity to vote against her. 
   Members must decide if their legacy to the Senate is to eliminate the filibuster's barrier to the Constitutional responsibility of all Senators to advise and consent with fair, up or down votes.

The conference report passed the Senate on Monday. 
   ""Providing the tools and resources our Tennessee soldiers need to protect freedom at home and abroad is the most important thing we can do,"" said Frist. ""This funding is an investment in our soldiers, and will help ensure that our military and reserve forces remain fully equipped and prepared. Projects for Fort Campbell, Arnold Air Force Base and the Tennessee National Guard will promote combat readiness while improving training and soldier morale.""
   ""This funding helps guarantee that our service men and women have the best possible housing, training, and conditions,"" said Alexander. ""I'll continue to work with Senator Frist to ensure that our Tennessee troops have the tools they need as they fight to keep us safe."" 
   Overall, funding for Tennessee's military construction priorities was more than $22 million above the Administration's budget request. Tennessee projects included in FY05 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report include:
   * $70.6 million for Fort Campbell to fund the construction of an airfield vehicle support facility, a standard design barracks and operations complex (phase I), a command and control facility, a shoot house, and aquatic training facility. The barracks will hold all of the soldiers in the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, while the command and control facility will house the Division staff and include administrative space, a conference room, intelligence centers, and an emergency operations center. 
   * $22 million for the Tennessee National Guard and the US Army Reserve, including $9.1 million for the Nashville Army National Guard Readiness Center (phase I), and $13.5 million for the Smyrna Joint Armed Forces Reserve Center. The renovation of the Readiness Center will provide over 75,000 square feet for administrative offices and logistical and training space. The Smyrna Reserve Center will serve the peacetime missions of the assigned unit. 
   * $41.5 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard at the Memphis International Airport to finance a C-5 Aircraft Parking Apron and Hydrant Refueling System as well as a Corrosion Control Hangar. Both projects are vital to accommodate the first of the C-5 aircraft arriving in 2004. 
   * $22 million for an Upgrade Jet Engine Air Induction System (Phase V) at the Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma, Tennessee. The completion of this project will enable infrastructure reductions and increase facility test capabilities. These facilities are used to simulate high altitude flight conditions for testing, evaluation, and development of advanced turbine engines for JSF, F-22, F-16, F-15, and F-18 fighter aircraft. Accurate test data on jet engine turbines could potentially increase the reliability of aircraft engines.

FRIST COMMENDS 108TH CONGRESS' ACHIEVEMENTS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist released the following statement commending the achievements of the 108th Congress for rural America:
   ""The 108th Congress passed sweeping reforms that strengthened our country and brought opportunities to more of America's citizens. Nowhere are these extensive contributions more apparent, than in the Congress' focus on supporting rural Americans. Indeed, working with the President's leadership, the 108th Congress was one of the greatest in history for helping America's rural communities. 
   ""We've brought tax relief to citizens throughout rural America by passing the economic stimulus package proposed by President Bush. Easing the burden on rural communities has enabled farmers, families and small rural businesses to hold on to their small businesses. In particular, the estate tax relief provision finally allows families to hold on to their land, which for many is the source of their livelihood, in the event that a loved one passes away. 
   ""Over the past two years, Congress has passed unprecedented agricultural tax relief measures, including: biodiesel tax credits that encourage production of clean-burning and domestic renewable energy sources like soybeans; small producer tax credits for ethanol; special tax rules for livestock sold on account of weather-related conditions; and the extension of income averaging for farmers so they will not be unfairly hurt by the alternative minimum tax.
   ""This weekend, Congress passed a landmark tobacco buyout that eases the growing burden on tobacco farmers throughout America. Increasingly these farmers were facing dire financial problems due to decreasing demand, shrinking quota allotments and increasing foreign competition. The buyout finally ends the outdated quota system, while providing fair compensation to quota holders and growers.
   ""The Senate also supported a provision providing nearly $3 billion in direct payments to farmers and livestock producers who have suffered losses on their 2003 and 2004 crops due to natural disasters.
   ""However, the contributions of this Congress go far beyond tax relief and agriculture policies. Over the past two years, Congress has concentrated its efforts on supporting a diverse range of rural social programs. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), signed into law last December, represents the most significant improvement to the Medicare program in two generations. In addition to providing seniors with over $400 billion in drug coverage over the next decade, the bill makes an historic $25 billion investment in rural health care services. This commitment to America's rural communities will ensure that all seniors have easier access to comprehensive and affordable quality health care. 
   ""In addition the Senate has proposed $175 million for rural education programs. These funds can be used by school districts in these regions in a variety of ways, including supporting instruction, enhancing curriculum and improving infrastructure in rural schools. 
   ""The 108th Congress has made unprecedented contributions to America's rural communities. I'm proud of our accomplishments and look forward to continuing our work on rural issues in the 109th Congress.""

FRIST, ALEXANDER ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR TENNESSEE NATIONAL GUARD, FORT CAMPBELL
  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today announced that the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, now awaiting President Bush's signature, includes more than $150 million for Tennessee military construction projects. The conference report passed the Senate on Monday.  
   ""Providing the tools and resources our Tennessee soldiers need to protect freedom at home and abroad is the most important thing we can do,"" said Frist. ""This funding is an investment in our soldiers, and will help ensure that our military and reserve forces remain fully equipped and prepared. Projects for Fort Campbell, Arnold Air Force Base and the Tennessee National Guard will promote combat readiness while improving training and soldier morale."" 
   ""This funding helps guarantee that our service men and women have the best possible housing, training, and conditions,"" said Alexander. ""I'll continue to work with Senator Frist to ensure that our Tennessee troops have the tools they need as they fight to keep us safe."" 
   Overall, funding for Tennessee's military construction priorities was more than $22 million above the Administration's budget request. Tennessee projects included in FY05 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report include: 
   * $70.6 million for Fort Campbell to fund the construction of an airfield vehicle support facility, a standard design barracks and operations complex (phase I), a command and control facility, a shoot house, and aquatic training facility. The barracks will hold all of the soldiers in the 5th Special Forces Group at Fort Campbell, while the command and control facility will house the Division staff and include administrative space, a conference room, intelligence centers, and an emergency operations center. 
   * $22 million for the Tennessee National Guard and the US Army Reserve, including $9.1 million for the Nashville Army National Guard Readiness Center (phase I), and $13.5 million for the Smyrna Joint Armed Forces Reserve Center. The renovation of the Readiness Center will provide over 75,000 square feet for administrative offices and logistical and training space. The Smyrna Reserve Center will serve the peacetime missions of the assigned unit. 
   * $41.5 million for the Tennessee Air National Guard at the Memphis International Airport to finance a C-5 Aircraft Parking Apron and Hydrant Refueling System as well as a Corrosion Control Hangar. Both projects are vital to accommodate the first of the C-5 aircraft arriving in 2004. 
   * $22 million for an Upgrade Jet Engine Air Induction System (Phase V) at the Arnold Air Force Base in Tullahoma, Tennessee. The completion of this project will enable infrastructure reductions and increase facility test capabilities. These facilities are used to simulate high altitude flight conditions for testing, evaluation, and development of advanced turbine engines for JSF, F-22, F-16, F-15, and F-18 fighter aircraft. Accurate test data on jet engine turbines could potentially increase the reliability of aircraft engines.

FRIST CALLS FOR FIRM RESPONSE TO NORTH KOREA'S CLAIMED NUCLEAR TEST
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-Tenn.) made the following statement after President Bush signed the North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006, which Sen. Frist authored earlier this summer:  
   ""I applaud President Bush for signing this important piece of legislation into law. North Korea's nuclear test and missile launches are a grave threat to international peace and security, and demonstrate the regime's absolute contempt for its neighbors and the international community. 
   ""We need a firm, multifaceted approach to North Korea's claimed nuclear test, which threatens peace and stability in the Pacific. As a part of this effort the President signed the North Korea Sanctions Act today. I urge the President to vigorously implement the sanctions provided for under this legislation, and I call on other concerned governments to apply similar measures to weapons-related trade with North Korea. 
   ""There is much more that can, and should, be done to build on the President's diplomatic efforts, so that North Korea will be left with no choice but to give up its nuclear ambitions."" 
   The legislation passed both the House and Senate earlier this summer and has been awaiting the president's signature. The act ensures that the United States will carefully review and impose appropriate sanctions on all foreign entities involved in transfers to or from North Korea of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, missiles, other advanced conventional weapons, and related items. U.S. law already provides for such treatment of these types of transfers to and from Iran and Syria, and this legislation ensures that the United States will extend the same treatment to North Korea.

FRIST SAYS NEW INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS SHOWS SEN. KERRY'S HEALTH CARE RHETORIC DOESN'T MATCH REALITY
  Majority Leader Bill Frist today released the following statement in response to AEI's study of the Kerry health care plan: 
   ""Today's independent study by the American Enterprise Institute shows that John Kerry's health care proposal - the most expensive of Senator Kerry's new spending initiatives even by his own estimates - will in reality cost substantially more than promised.  
   ""There already was a wide gap between John Kerry's spending proposals and the money he claims he would raise by increasing taxes to pay for his spending proposals. Today, that gap has become an enormous canyon. Either Senator Kerry won't be able to pay for all the new health care benefits he's promised the American people, or he will have to raise taxes substantially on all middle class Americans or increase the deficit. 
   ""Both Senator Kerry and his running mate John Edwards - a career personal injury trial lawyer before his election to the Senate six years ago - have loudly and consistently opposed common sense medical liability reforms with a proven track record of holding down costs. They opposed giving affordable prescription drugs to seniors under the new Medicare prescription drug law. They opposed giving Americans more affordable health insurance coverage through tax-free Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Instead, they have proposed to shift billions of dollars in skyrocketing health costs to America's taxpayers and to give bureaucrats in Washington more control over health care decisions that should be made by patients and their doctors. 
   ""In contrast to Senator Kerry's empty rhetoric and shallow record of health care accomplishments after nearly 20 years in the United States Senate, President Bush and Congressional Republicans have won major victories on behalf of patients and consumers during the past four years. The landmark Medicare prescription drug law is already providing lower cost prescription drugs to millions of seniors. Three million more low-income Americans are getting health care because of President Bush's historic expansion of neighborhood community health centers. All Americans have the opportunity to have more control over their health care choices and hard-earned dollars through tax-free HSAs.
   ""Moreover, the President has proposed to expand association health plans to give small companies the same ability as larger firms to negotiate lower health premiums; to enroll millions of eligible children in the S-CHIP and Medicaid programs; to give lower income Americans and small business owners the ability to purchase affordable health coverage through refundable tax credits; to make health insurance more affordable and to expand HSAs; and to finally pass needed medical liability reforms.""

  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) today applauded the announcement from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Mike Leavitt that the Memphis region will attain clean air standards three years sooner than required.  
   ""Today's announcement reflects Memphis' continuing commitment to improving its air quality,"" Frist said. ""Responsible environmental stewardship today will ensure that Memphis remains a clean, growing and vibrant city in the years to come."" 
   ""This is real progress and a good example of teamwork between local, state and federal officials to address our clean air challenges,"" said Alexander. ""Ultimately, we will need strong federal legislation to clean the air in Memphis and across Tennessee, but today's announcement is an important step in the right direction."" 
   Earlier this summer, Tennessee petitioned the EPA to designate the Memphis area as ""Marginal"" under the Clean Air Act. Marginal nonattainment areas must implement pollution control measures to achieve clean air sooner than Moderate areas. 
   Working with local, state, and private industry leaders, Memphis earned new classification by demonstrating its ability to implement stringent pollution control measures that will bring air quality levels into the approved range over the next three years. Moderate areas must attain national 8-hour ozone air quality standards no later than June 2010. Marginal areas must attain by June 2007. 
   Shelby County has implemented several measures to improve air quality. Some of these include: returning to a 55 mph speed limit in all developed areas of the county; cooperating with Crittenden County (Arkansas) on a study of the air quality monitor in Marion, AR; and launching a county-wide public outreach and education program through the recently formed Mid-South Clean Air Coalition.

  Sens. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) today heralded the return of state sales tax deductibility for Tennesseans on their 2004 and 2005 tax returns. This is the first time since 1986 that Tennesseans have been able to deduct their state sales taxes on their federal income tax returns.  
   This new provision provides significant savings to many Tennessee families. The Scoby family of Nashville plans on using the refund gained from the sales tax deduction to pay down their home mortgage. In Chattanooga, Bubba and Tara Williams and their three children plan on putting the refund into their savings account. Tad and Robin Dance and their three kids recently moved to Ooltewah from South Carolina where they paid state income tax. This will be the first year that they receive a federal tax refund. Contact information for these families is available at the end of this release. 
   ""Along with tax season, this spring also brings a return of fairness to our tax code,"" said Frist. ""For the first time in nearly two decades, Tennesseans will no longer be unfairly penalized by our tax system. Allowing Tennesseans to deduct their state sales taxes from their federal returns empowers families, grows our economy, and is plainly the right thing to do. This is an issue I've been passionate about since arriving in the Senate, and I'm glad this sensible and equitable reform will mean nearly $500 in savings for almost one-quarter of Tennesseans filing their taxes for 2004. Government must stand for fairness, and the return of sales tax deductibility reflects our commitment to giving Tennessee's families a fair shake. I'm proud of what we've accomplished and look forward to ensuring this provision is made permanent, so Tennesseans are guaranteed equal and fair treatment in years to come."" 
   ""Allowing state sales taxes to be deductible makes good economic sense; it's just good common sense and it's the fair thing to do,"" said Alexander. ""This year it puts an average of $470 in the pockets of nearly 600,000 Tennesseans who itemize their taxes. Nationwide, state and local sales tax collections account for about a quarter of total state tax revenue, which is about the same as property taxes and income taxes. The major difference is that people who pay state and local sales taxes haven't been able to deduct them from their federal income tax like those who pay property and income taxes since 1986. I'm proud to join Senator Frist and Representative Blackburn in this fight for tax fairness and will continue to work to make this provision permanent."" 
   ""Tax fairness is an issue Tennesseans feel passionate about,"" said Blackburn. ""And the sales tax deduction is clearly a matter of fairness. We worked hard to restore the deduction, and today Tennesseans are benefiting. Tennessee sales tax collections were up by $14.8 million in March, business activity on our main streets is growing, and all because taxpayers are getting to keep more of what they earn. For nearly two decades restoration of the deduction failed to pass Congress, but, by working together, we were able to make this goal a reality. Majority Leader Frist, Senator Alexander, and I have already begun the effort to make this deduction a permanent part of the tax code, and I look forward to the work ahead."" 
   The state sales tax deductibility provision was signed into law by President Bush on October 22, 2004 as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Before passage of this legislation, individuals were only permitted to deduct state income and property taxes on their federal tax returns. Seven states - Alaska, Texas, Florida, Wyoming, Washington, South Dakota and Nevada - do not have a state income tax. Two states - Tennessee and New Hampshire - only impose an income tax on interest and dividends, but not wages. Therefore, residents of these states who itemize were placed at a disadvantage simply because these states choose to raise revenue through primarily a sales tax instead of an income tax. Approximately 25 percent of Tennessee taxpayers itemize and stand to receive an average $470 in tax savings. 
   The American Jobs Creation Act makes state sales taxes deductible for 2004 and 2005. Senator Frist and Senator Alexander are currently cosponsoring a piece of legislation which will make state sales tax deductible permanent.

  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) today made the following statement regarding the border security and immigration reform bill:  
   ""More people will risk their lives trying to cross the US-Mexico border this week because of Minority Leader Harry Reid's refusal to act to strengthen our borders. Senator Reid's politics of delay and distraction are the reason we can't move forward on immigration reform. His refusal to even allow debate on amendments hurts our ability to stop illegal immigration before it starts and underscores his commitment to playing politics with a security, economic and humanitarian issue that affects all Americans. 
   ""For example, we have reliable estimates that about 80 percent of all illegal immigrants in the U.S. come from Mexico, but we do not know the particular parts of Mexico they come from. I have an amendment that would direct the Department of Homeland Security and State Department to determine which regions of Mexico produce the most illegal immigrants. Upon completion of this survey, the amendment would require the State Department and USAID to focus their economic development efforts on these regions. This will give us the ability to use our economic development resources where they are most needed and will address the lack of economic opportunity in our neighboring countries that is the root cause of almost all illegal immigration. 
   ""Another provision I authored focused on providing an expedited path to citizenship for legal immigrants bravely fighting for our country in the armed forces. These brave men and women deserve a fast track to citizenship, but because Senator Reid has put politics above policy, thousands of our servicemen and women will need to wait before we can call them our fellow Americans. 
   ""Instead of voting on amendments like these, Senator Reid has opted for the obstructionist path and has derailed a solution that had broad bipartisan Senate support. I call on him to halt his political posturing and to join us at the table with a genuine commitment to addressing this real and growing challenge.""

  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., (R-Tenn.) today joined Senate colleagues and members of the law enforcement community at a press conference highlighting the inclusion of anti-methamphetamine provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization conference report.  
   The majority leader has made reducing methamphetamine abuse one of his top law enforcement priorities. Last year law enforcement officials seized 1,534 methamphetamine labs in Tennessee, the second highest number of any state in the nation. 
   The legislation will require a minimum standard for restricting access to pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA) - the key ingredients used to make meth in all 50 states. Once implemented, the law will help prevent methamphetamine ingredients from flooding across Tennessee's borders. The legislation does not preempt current state laws restricting access to methamphetamine ingredients but instead simply requires states that have not acted to do so. 
   ""Meth is destroying individuals, families, and whole communities,"" Frist said. ""I want to thank my Senate colleagues and officials from the Tennessee law enforcement community for supporting this critical public health and safety measure. Restricting access to precursor chemicals is the best way to prevent meth dealers from obtaining the ingredients they need to manufacture the drug. I urge my colleagues to support this important victory for law enforcement officials and communities across America."" 
   ""The men and women of law enforcement here in Tennessee are particularly appreciative of Senator Frist's efforts and attention to our fight against methamphetamines,"" Tennessee Fraternal Order of Police President Carl Jenkins said. ""This legislation addresses the growing methamphetamine problem by providing new resources and tools to aid law enforcement in its fight against this drug epidemic. The law enforcement officers in the State of Tennessee are proud that Senator Frist - one of their own - led the fight to have this language included in the bill."" 
   ""I'm excited that this issue is being addressed at the federal level by legislation that sets minimum standards without preempting the work of states that have already taken bold steps to enact sales restrictions,"" South/East Tennessee Methamphetamine Task Force Director Tommy Farmer said. ""These restrictions are critical to fighting meth, and we've seen the positive results in every state that has passed them. Senator Frist has acted honorably by leading the effort in Congress to restrict access to meth ingredients across the entire country."" 
   ""National legislation should have a tremendous effect on clandestine labs,"" Judge Seth Norman of the Davidson County Drug Court said. ""Senator Frist has recognized the meth problem in Tennessee and has lent invaluable time and effort to working against the problem. With the leadership of Senator Frist I believe that national legislation controlling the sale of the precursors for the manufacturing of methamphetamine will prevent the spread of this epidemic. This would save the taxpayers of this country billions of dollars."" 
   Frist, Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), and Congressman Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) also worked together recently to secure $4 million in federal funding to develop a statewide methamphetamine task force and help ensure that law enforcement officials throughout Tennessee have the training and equipment they need to address the state's methamphetamine crisis.

   ""I was shocked to hear of this brutal attack on Prime Minister Hariri and mourn his loss. Rafik Hariri fought long and hard for Lebanon's sovereignty and independenceHe worked tirelessly to achieve freedom and prosperity for the Lebanese people and served his country with distinction. 
   ""This tragedy is a consequence of the instability in Lebanon caused by the presence of Syrian troops. I call on the Syrian government to comply with its obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its forces from Lebanese territory, free the Lebanese people of foreign occupation, and allow forthcoming elections to take place without undue outside influence or interference. 
   ""The Lebanese people deserve the freedom to determine their own future free of violence, intimidation and foreign occupation. I stand by them in their continued efforts to realize Prime Minister Hariri's dream of a free and prosperous Lebanon."" 
   In September 2004 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1559 calling for a withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. This resolution reaffirmed the international community's call for the respect of Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.
