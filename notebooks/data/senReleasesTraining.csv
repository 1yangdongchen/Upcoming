VOINOVICH SECURES ASSISTANCE FOR STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS, EMPLOYERS IN SENATE-PASSED FORECLOSURE BILL
  The U.S. Senate today passed the bipartisan legislative plan to help ease the housing crisis by a vote of 84 to 12. U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) secured immediate relief and assistance for struggling Ohio homeowners and employers in the bill. 
   The Sen. Voinovich-authored provisions include: 
   * Simplifying mortgage documents to ensure Ohioans understand clearly the terms of their mortgage before signing them;
   * Tackling reform of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which could allow Americans facing foreclosure or resetting interest rates to refinance without the usual burdens associated with a FHA loan by increasing and simplifying FHA's loan limits; 
   * Providing funding for financial counseling programs; 
   * Increasing Community Development Block Grant funding targeted towards revitalizing residential areas; and 
   * Allowing companies in a loss position to use accumulated AMT and R&D credits early to make new investments that will create jobs in lieu of the bonus depreciation provision included in the recently-enacted stimulus bill. 
   Sen. Voinovich originally introduced the first four provisions in previous legislation and fought for them with committee leadership. The employer tax credits provision was introduced as an amendment to the compromise bill by Sen. Voinovich and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and successfully amended to the overall bill by a vote of 76-2 last week.
   ""Americans have looked to Congress to take real action to help protect homeowners,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This bipartisan compromise is a solid step in the right direction and includes the types of immediate relief and assistance struggling homeowners have been waiting for.""
    Sen. Voinovich is particularly pleased about the inclusion of his employer tax credits provision. Companies in a loss position cannot take advantage of the bonus depreciation provision included in the recently-enacted stimulus bill because they do not have any taxable income against which to take the deductions. Ironically, these are the companies who are struggling the most and who are in greatest need of relief. This will create jobs and, in turn, help people pay their mortgages. 
   ""A good-paying job is the first step to ensure Americans can achieve the dream of homeownership and sustain that dream throughout their lives,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This amendment is crucial because Ohio is experiencing a foreclosure crisis that has nothing to do with speculators. Ohio has a foreclosure crisis despite the fact that house prices never increased in the state. Ohio families have been losing their homes because Ohio manufacturing workers have been losing their jobs.""
   Sen. Voinovich has authored three pieces of legislation focused on helping to ease the current crisis and providing additional tools for neighborhoods to revitalize and restore abandoned properties. 
   Sen. Voinovich originally proposed improved disclosure for mortgage documents and additional resources for rehabilitating foreclosed properties and for housing counseling in his Protecting American Homeowners Act of 2008, which was introduced last week. The reform of FHA was originally proposed by Sen. Voinovich in his FHA Modernization Act, which has been passed by both chambers. The differences between the House and Senate FHA reform bills are currently being worked out in conference. 
   Additionally, Sen. Voinovich's Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act was passed by the Senate and the House and has been signed into law by the president. Sen. Voinovich was moved to draft this bill after hearing stories about how homeowners were working out deals with their lenders, and the lenders were forgiving part of the mortgages to make payments more affordable. He was then shocked to learn the IRS was taxing that loan forgiveness as income. 
   This additional tax liability actually penalizes those who are trying to work out their financial problems in a responsible manner. Altering this tax penalty encourages homeowners and lenders to work together voluntarily so that payments are manageable and foreclosure can be avoided. So far, this is the only bill to become law that directly attempts to ease the foreclosure crisis. Sen. Voinovich is working on extending it for two additional years.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES STRENGTHENED BEACH PROTECTION ACT
  Today, U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) - Co-Chairman of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force - along with U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), introduced a bill reauthorizing the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act, the Beach Protection Act of 2008. 
   This legislation increases grants to states, including Great Lakes states like Ohio, for the development and implementation of programs focused on remediating contamination sources - something that is currently not covered under the BEACH Act. This bill also requires stronger beach water quality testing and public notification standards so beachgoers are better informed about the safety of their beaches.
   ""The Great Lakes are our nation's north coast and millions of Americans enjoy their beaches every year,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""This bill is a vital piece of a comprehensive strategy that is absolutely necessary to save one of our nation's greatest natural resources. It will help our beaches remain healthy and safe and will protect them from the detrimental effects of pollution and sewage contamination after flooding or heavy rainfall. This is good not only for our environment but for our economy.""
   The reintroduction is a result of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study requested by Sen. Voinovich on the effect of the BEACH Act on the Great Lakes states. The GAO report found that:
   * The Great Lakes states are receiving an inequitable amount of grant funding due to length of beach season;
   * The law should provide more flexibility to states to use BEACH Act grants to investigate and remediate contamination sources; and
   * That Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should distribute grant funds to reflect state's monitoring needs.
   Traditionally, the BEACH Act has only allowed grants for beach monitoring and public notification programs. The frequency of water quality monitoring has increased at Great Lakes beaches since the passage of the BEACH Act, helping states and localities identify the scope of contamination. However, in most cases, the underlying causes of contamination remain unknown and unaddressed because state and local officials state that they do not have the funds to investigate the source of the contamination or take actions to mitigate the problem. EPA has not allowed BEACH Act grants to be used for these purposes.
   Under the reintroduced BEACH Act, the EPA is required to work with states to ensure they used the latest science to sample and test beach waters to protect the public's health. The law also helps states set up comprehensive monitoring and notification programs in order to provide up-to-date information on the condition of all public beaches.
   Additionally, the legislation doubles the authorized grant funding to states from $30 million to $60 million annually through 2012. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee - of which Sen. Voinovich is a member - will have oversight over the bill.

VOINOVICH SECURES $1.8 MILLION FOR HEALTH CARE FOR CLEVELAND'S HOMELESS
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) has secured a $1,808,408 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Care Alliance, a Cleveland non-profit health care organization. The grant will provide health and dental services to those in the Cleveland area who are homeless or living in public housing.  
   ""I'm pleased that we were able to secure funding for the work that Care Alliance does. With these funds, Care Alliance will be able to continue their efforts to improve the lives of Cleveland's less fortunate,"" said Voinovich. ""Care Alliance is a vital resource to the city of Cleveland and has a major impact on the health and welfare of thousands of people each year. Continued funding will improve the health status of underserved and vulnerable citizens who depend greatly on the services it provides."" 
   The grant will be used to provide support for Care Alliance programs, including providing primary health care, regardless of age; health screenings and short-term counseling; HIV and AIDS counseling and treatment; immunizations; comprehensive dental care; and a special program for those affected by diabetes, which currently has more than 195 enrollees. 
   Established in 1993, Care Alliance (formerly Cleveland Health Care for the Homeless) was founded as one of the nation's original Health Care for the Homeless projects. It has grown into a non-profit community health center whose mission is to provide high-quality health care and related services to people who need it most--regardless of their ability to pay--in a manner that is cost-effective and that empowers people to improve their quality of life. There is no other organization in the Cleveland area specifically dedicated to providing health care to this population.

VOINOVICH ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Wednesday, January 10, released the following statement regarding the new direction in Iraq and the call for a surge in troops. Sen. George Voinovich met with President Bush in the White House on Friday to discuss the current situation. Also in attendance were Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rice, National Security Advisor Hadley, Gen. Peter Pace and top White House officials. He also attended a three-hour classified intelligence briefing yesterday. Sen. George Voinovich's statement follows: 
  ""At this point I am skeptical that a surge in troops alone will bring an end to sectarian violence and the insurgency that is fomenting instability in Iraq. The generals who have served there do not believe additional troops alone will help. And my faith in Prime Minister al-Maliki's political will to make the hard choices necessary to bring about a political solution is fragile at best. What we need first is a political solution between Sunni Arabs and Shia militias that are adding to the violence.
  ""Over the next month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, will hold three hearings a week on Iraq. During that time I hope to receive from the administration the level of detail necessary to make a decision of this magnitude. And I want real evidence that a potential surge in troops will do more good than harm and will not exacerbate the existing violence in Iraq. This move may have enormous national security implications for our nation. I want answers to many critical questions and to hear straight from the generals about why this would be in the best interest of the United States."".

   ""This is great economic news for the Cincinnati area and the entire state. The 1,000 new jobs will have a significant economic impact and the quality of the IT workforce in Cincinnati will help keep the United States competitive in the global marketplace.

That is why I have co-sponsored the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act of 2006 - legislation aimed at improving our nation's competitiveness through advancements in science and math education. Reinvestment in science and math is a key element to building a highly knowledgeable workforce of young Americans. We must commit ourselves to improving our human capital so that our nation may continue to compete with the world's best and brightest.""

VOINOVICH CO-SPONSORS BILL TO ELIMINATE TAX CODE BY 2010
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), the Senate's top ""deficit hawk,"" today co-sponsored the Tax Code Termination Act - legislation that would repeal the U.S. Tax Code by 2010 and force Congress to reauthorize it or replace it with a new system that's fair and easy to understand.  
  ""Washington has become too accustomed to its current culture - a culture that's destroying our competitiveness in the global marketplace,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Drastic measures are needed if we want to create better jobs and a higher quality of life for our kids and grandkids.""
  The Tax Code Termination Act, written by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), also creates a bipartisan commission that would be required to examine and to recommend to Congress plausible replacements for the tax code. 
   The commission would also be required to report on the potential impact of any new tax system on the U.S. economy and on the government's ability to collect revenue. And the bill will create a National Commission on Tax Reform within the legislative branch, consisting of 19 members. Four of the members will be required to come from businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The commission will be appointed by the president, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the House and the House Minority Leader.
  ""Congress needs a serious overhaul of its tax code if we're going to get this country back on the right track,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""While it won't be easy to pass this legislation, it will at least help us bring attention to this problem, and force this Congress and administration to deal with these looming issues instead of passing the buck to future generations.""
  Also, in January, Sen. Voinovich re-introduced legislation aimed at a comprehensive reform of our nation's tax and entitlement systems. The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act also establishes a national commission to examine these systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. The Commission will bring together the best minds associated with budget and economic policies to examine the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States and recommend reforms. The Commission may consider all policy options, including:
  * Limiting the growth of entitlement spending to ensure that the programs are fiscally sustainable;
   * Strengthening the safety net functions of entitlement programs to provide assistance to the neediest;
   * Making the tax code more efficient and more conducive to economic growth; and
   * Providing incentives to increase private savings.

     Statement of Senator Barack Obama on International Human Rights Day Monday  December 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC    The following statement was submitted by U  S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  in the Congressional Record today on International Human Rights Day      Mr  President  today is Human Rights Day  Fifty nine years ago today  thanks in large measure to the tireless leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt  the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      The principles encompassed in the Declaration are uniquely rooted in the American tradition  beginning with our founding documents  Yet the Declaration also wove together a remarkable variety of political  religious  and cultural perspectives and traditions  The United States and the United Kingdom championed civil liberties  The French representative on the committee helped devise the structure of the Declaration  India added the prohibition on discrimination  China stressed the importance of family and reminded UN delegates that every right carried with it companion duties  Today should be a day of celebration  a day when we hail the universality of these core principles  which are both beacons to guide us and the foundations for building a more just and stable world        The Universal Declaration was a radical document in its time  and its passage required courageous leadership from political leaders  Even though no country could have been said to be in full compliance with its provisions  including the United States where Jim Crow still prevailed  all UN member states committed themselves to promoting  protecting  and respecting fundamental human rights  Although Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not live to see the enactment of the historic Declaration  it enshrined his    four freedoms       freedom from want  freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and freedom from fear  Individuals in the United States and everywhere else were entitled  simply by virtue of being human  to physical and economic security  The Declaration was born of the recognition  in the words of one human rights scholar  that    what is pain and humiliation for you is pain and humiliation for me           Anniversaries are a good time to examine how faithful we have been to our own aspirations     to ask ourselves how well we are measuring up  to assess whether our practice lives up to our promise  We in the United States enjoy tremendous freedoms  but we also carry a special responsibility     the responsibility of being the country so many people in the world look to  just as they did in Mrs  Roosevelt   s day  for human rights leadership        Today  on this anniversary  we must acknowledge both bad news and good news  The bad news is that for nearly seven years  President Bush has ignored Franklin Roosevelt s wise counsel about the corrosive effects of fear  Indeed  instead of urging us to reject fear  he has stoked false fear and undermined our values        Wounded by a horrific terrorist attack  we were warned that Saddam Hussein     a man who had nothing to do with that attack     could unleash mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs  We were told that waterboarding was effective  We were assured that shipping men off to countries that tortured was good for national security  We were led to believe that our military and civilian courts were inadequate  and so we established a network of unaccountable prisons  And the Administration launched secret wiretapping initiatives  scoffed at the rule of law  and flaunted the will of the Congress          Nonetheless  in his second inaugural  President Bush rightly proclaimed     America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one     But  tragically  he has failed to heed his own words   We have not only vacated the perch of moral leader  we have also compounded the threat we face  spurring more people to take up arms against us       The further bad news is that other countries have not stepped up to fill the void left by our lack of moral leadership  The hundreds of thousands killed and two million displaced by the genocide in Darfur  the shell shocked Buddhist monks in Burma  the political opposition in Zimbabwe  the imprisoned independent journalists in Russia  the brave human rights lawyers and judges in Pakistan     they do not know where to turn internationally  Human rights abusers win seats on the UN Human Rights Council  the International Criminal Court issues war crimes indictments  but no country steps up to enforce them  the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations begs in vain for troops  helicopters and police to help stave off humanitarian catastrophes  For all these reasons  the world needs renewed  principled U S  leadership       There is another critical reason why America must again provide moral leadership on human rights  the fate of women around the world  Whether it is in creating wealth  access to capital  and property rights  or receiving quality education  health care  and social services  women still lag far behind men   And of course the lack of full reproductive rights can be a matter of life and death for too many women  Inequality means insecurity for women  especially those who comprise 70 percent of the world   s poorest  There is a clear link between discrimination and violence against women  equality and empowerment of women is the most effective approach to ending violence against women  Today  violent acts against women  in the words of UNICEF     are the most pervasive violation of human rights in the world today           Women   s inequality and the persistent prevalence of honor killings  trafficking  repression  and sexual assault nearly six decades after the Universal Declaration shame us all  One need only look to Saudi Arabia  where a 19 year old woman  who was raped  instead of receiving treatment and support  was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for riding in a car with a non related male   In the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Darfur  rape is routinely used as a weapon of war by militia and government forces   In northern Uganda  young girls are given as    prizes    to older male soldiers to reward performance        In Pakistan  international observers report that one of the largest challenges facing its next election is guaranteeing women enough security so they can leave their homes to vote  In Iraq the militarization and rise of radical Islam has eroded women   s rights  In Afghanistan  while nothing can compare to the day when the Taliban ruled the entire country  women throughout that country complain that their freedoms have been woefully curtailed  The United States alone cannot solve the problem of women s suffering and gender inequality around the world  but with new  principled leadership  the United States can elevate women s economic  political and social development to the top of our international agenda and ensure that women around the world know that they have a reliable friend and partner in America      Let me close by saying that the very depth of the anti Americanism felt around the world today is a testament not to hatred but to disappointment  acute disappointment  The global public expects more from America  They expect our government to embody what they have seen in our people  industriousness  humanity  generosity  and a commitment to equality  We can become that country again                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be

homeless veterans and their families and help prevent very low income veteran families from falling into homelessness   Rep  Al Green  TX 09  worked with Veterans  Affairs Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Michaud  ME 02  to introduce the Homes for Heroes Act in the House in August 2007   This afternoon  the White House issued a  Statement of Administration Policy  stating that the Davis Bacon Act s prevailing wage requirements included in the bill will make H R  3329 subject to a veto by the President    The bill was introduced in the U S  Senate by Sen  Barack Obama  D IL  in April 2007   Today  the House took an important step in honoring our military men and women by passing this critical legislation that will help eliminate homelessness and provide affordable housing opportunities for our nation s heroes   This is the least a grateful nation can do   Rep  Green said    As the House sponsor of the Homes for Heroes Act  I especially thank Senator Barack Obama for championing this bill in the Senate and commend my colleagues in the House for voting to provide those who have sacrificed for our country with the assistance they deserve  I urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto a bill that will ensure a brighter future for all of our veterans    Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country  and we must do everything we can to provide these heroes with housing and job opportunities when they return home   said Senator Obama    Unfortunately  far too many of these brave men and women are living on the streets  and that is unacceptable   I am proud to support this legislation  which will go a long way in meeting our commitment to our veterans   I commend Congressman Al Green for his leadership in moving this widely supported legislation through the House   I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this bill as soon as possible  and I call on the President to sign it into law   On any given night in this country  800 000 persons experience homelessness and  according to the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   nearly 200 000 of these homeless Americans are adult veterans who live on the streets  in shelters or in community based organizations   Nearly 400 000 veterans may experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year   Of these    47 percent of homeless veterans are Vietnam veterans Half have mental illness Two thirds suffer from alcohol or other substance abuse problems 56 percent of all homeless veterans are African American or Latino   This bill not only brings to light the plight of up to 400 000 homeless veterans  it brings them one step closer to being able to say they have achieved the American dream of a home to call their own   Providing our veterans with affordable housing and supportive services is the least we can do for those who fight for us   Rep  Michaud said  The Homes for Heroes Act will   Establish a  200 million assistance program for supportive housing and services for low income veterans  Expand the highly successful Department of Housing and Urban Development   Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  HUD VASH  Program  authorizing 20 000 vouchers annually and making the program permanent  Authorize  1 million in HUD grants to assist housing and service providers with the execution of their housing projects for veterans assisted by HUD

Senators Have Also Proposed Bill To Close Loophole Exempting Lobbyists For Foreign Corporations From Reporting Requirements WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Barack Obama  D IL   today called on the internal watchdog at the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to investigate the agency s spotty enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   a federal law requiring disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign entities such as governments and political parties  The senators believe that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of FARA  allowing certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad  the senators said   Too many lobbyists are skirting the law and operating in the shadows  and in too many cases  the Justice Department is standing at the light switch  refusing to turn it on  We want answers   Schumer said   The public has a right to know when our government is being lobbied by foreign interests and the Department of Justice has a responsibility to uphold and enforce the law in all circumstances    In a place where we need more transparency  not less  lapses in enforcement of lobbying disclosure laws should not be taken lightly   McCaskill said   This is serious matter  and I expect the Inspector General to address it head on to assure the enforcers are truly enforcing the law    It is unacceptable that lobbyists can exploit loopholes to hide their lobbying contacts on behalf of foreign businesses and governments   said Senator Obama    The American people have a right to know who these individuals are representing and which American officials they re lobbying   Abusing the law to hide access and special treatment is exactly the kind of Washington culture that I ve been fighting against   I am proud to stand with Senators Schumer and McCaskill to close these loopholes  and I call on the Justice Department to immediately investigate this abuse of the law   The intent of FARA  passed by Congress in 1938  was to bring transparency to the work of lobbyists representing foreign clients by requiring the lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice  But in recent months  multiple cases have surfaced where lobbyists acting as foreign agents have either registered with the DOJ late or not at all  Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless   Senators Schumer  McCaskill and Obama today asked the DOJ Inspector General for a report on the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law  The Senators have also called on the Inspector General to take appropriate steps within the Department to look at the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General with suggestions as to how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  In June  Senators Schumer  McCaskill  and Obama unveiled legislation that would close two loopholes allowing U S  lobbyists to influence government officials on behalf of foreign clients without having to disclose their activities  The Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  would require all lobbyists representing foreign clients to register under FARA  even if they have already registered under Lobbying Disclosure Act  LDA   Under current law  lobbyists registered under LDA are exempt from also registering under the more rigorous FARA  The bill would also require that any lobbying contacts with U S  officials on behalf of foreign clients be disclosed even when they occur outside of the United States  Currently  the law only covers contacts that occur  within the United States    A copy of the Senators  letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine is below     July 9  2008 Mr  Glenn A  Fine  United States Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Mr  Fine  It has come to our attention that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA    We would like to know more about the decision making process behind FARA enforcement and whether or not enforcement has been uneven or lax over time   As you are well aware  FARA was passed in 1938 and requires disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign governments  individuals  political parties  and corporations   Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad   Recently  we introduced the Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  in order to close two loopholes in the law that allow certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  We believe that the requirements under FARA are clear and should be enforced in all circumstances   Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless  We know that you share our commitment to maintaining the public s trust in government   We believe that allowing individuals to break the law and operate in the dark on behalf of foreign entities will erode this trust we hold so dear   Therefore  we request an examination of the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law    We hope that you take appropriate steps within your Department to look into the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General or his appropriate subordinate with suggestions on how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  We also request that you transmit to us  and the appropriate congressional committees of jurisdiction  a report on your findings  We look forward to hearing from you on this matter     Charles E  Schumer    United States Senator                                                      Claire

WHITEHOUSE SHARES WESTERLY GIRL'S STORY IN PUSH FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH
  Sharing the story of Lila Barber, a 12 year old girl from Westerly, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Tuesday, April 10, 2007, illustrated the hope stem cell research can offer in a speech on the Senate floor in favor of legislation to expand federal funding for stem cell research.  
   Whitehouse met Lila two weeks ago. She was diagnosed two years ago with osteosarcoma, a cancerous bone condition, and last year underwent cadaver bone transplant surgery. The procedure saved her leg and is helping her remain cancer-free, but the transplanted tissue will not grow with her and likely will break down over time. Stem cell research, Whitehouse explained, could vastly improve the care of patients like Lila by allowing surgeons to enhance transplants with a patient's own stem cells, which could replace the lost bone and cartilage, or grow entirely new replacement bones and joints. 
   ""Stem cell research gives hope to Lila and millions of Americans challenged by osteosarcoma, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, stroke, and a myriad of diseases and conditions this research might help or even cure,"" Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse also praised the efforts of Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin (D), a champion of stem cell legislation nationally and in Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts. Roberts today released a statewide report on stem cells, a first step toward developing a comprehensive plan for research initiatives in Rhode Island. 
   The Stem Cell Enhancement Act (S. 5) expands the number of human embryonic stem cells eligible for federally-funded research beyond the arbitrary limits imposed by President Bush in August 2001. The bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research on stem cells derived from embryos currently stored in fertility clinics that would otherwise be destroyed. 
   Last year, 63 senators voted to pass the Stem Cell Enhancement Act (H.R. 810), legislation similar to S. 5. President Bush issued the first veto of his presidency to block the bipartisan measure.

WHITEHOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BEGIN BRINGING TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ
  President Bush's refusal to say when American troops will come home from Iraq leaves America less safe and adds to the already-immense burdens facing service members and their families, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who traveled to Iraq a year ago, reiterated his belief that an announcement that the United States plans to redeploy its forces is the strongest weapon at our disposal to bring about political progress in Iraq:
   ""It's time for President Bush to listen to the American people and take action to bring our troops home from Iraq. Today, again, the President made clear that he has no intention of doing that.
   ""Iraq is embroiled in a sectarian civil war. It's clear the violence will not stop until the Iraqis take responsibility for the security and governance of their nation. To hasten that day of reconciliation, America can do one thing and one thing only: we must announce that we will redeploy our troops.
   ""Instead, President Bush has chosen to leave our servicemen and women in harm's way indefinitely, with no assurance of when, or under what conditions, they will come home. America's military has been strained almost to the breaking point, taking a serious toll on the health and welfare of our service members and their families, and leaving us ill-prepared to face gathering threats around the world.
   ""With more than 4,000 American lives lost and hundreds of billions of American tax dollars spent, the most important question for our nation is this: when can our troops return? President Bush's refusal to answer that question fails our troops, repudiates the will of the American people, and mortgages our country's security and our future.""

WHITEHOUSE TELLS NOMINEE
  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must undertake a thorough, comprehensive review of the process by which the agency makes decisions to determine whether Bush administration officials have put political considerations above science and the law, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said today at a confirmation hearing for the nominee to be EPA's general counsel. 
   ""The fact that the courts of the United States have felt compelled to characterize the positions EPA has taken in recent litigation by referring to Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland is embarrassing both to the agency and to the American people,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the EPW Committee. ""I'm deeply concerned that this Administration appears to be making legal decisions that impact our environment and public health not on their merits or their likelihood of success, but to advance a political agenda that risks lasting harm to our country.""
   At today's confirmation hearing, the EPW Committee heard testimony from David Hill, President Bush's nominee to be General Counsel of the EPA. Whitehouse closely questioned Hill on his commitment to helping EPA regain the stature and independence it has lost during the Bush Administration.
   There have been numerous signs that the decision-making process at EPA in recent years, and particularly under current Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, has been compromised by political considerations that disregard the demands of federal law and scientific evidence. Since 2001, federal courts have reversed a significant number of EPA's rules, including decisions relating to mercury emissions, water pollution discharges, new source review, and restrictions on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks.
   In New York v. EPA, decided in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said EPA's legal argument supporting its decision to weaken new source review requirements belonged ""in a Humpty Dumpty world."" In New Jersey v. EPA, decided two years later, the same court said EPA's position employs ""the logic of the Queen of Hearts."" Hill acknowledged during today's hearing that he had reviewed those cases.
   Yesterday, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA) subpoenaed Administrator Johnson for the third time this year to compel the release of documents related to the EPA's denial of a request by California, Rhode Island, and other states to set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Documents reviewed by staff members of the EPW Committee showed that EPA's professional staff pushed Johnson to approve the California waiver, and demonstrated concerns among EPA staff that a denial of the waiver request would not survive a challenge in court. The documents also showed that Johnson consulted with White House officials on the waiver issue.
   On January 2, 2008, California, Rhode Island, and several other states and environmental organizations sued EPA to overturn Johnson's decision. The suit is now pending in the D.C. Circuit Court.

  U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) praised today's decision by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) to deny a dredging permit to Weaver's Cove Energy, LLC. The agency said the company's application to dredge 230,000 cubic yards of sediment from the federal navigational channel in Mount Hope Bay was ""incomplete and insufficient."" 
   ""This news is a positive development for opponents of this proposal, and I hope the Army Corps of Engineers draws on DEM's work as the Corps makes its own permitting decisions,"" said Reed.
   ""DEM's decision recognizes the significant risks LNG tanker traffic would pose to the ecological health of Narragansett Bay and the safety of surrounding communities,"" Whitehouse said. ""I'm committed to doing all I can to help stop this facility.""
   According to a DEM news release, Weaver's Cove did not provide essential information on the projected impact of dredging on water quality and marine life, and significantly expanded the proposed number of tankers that would transit the Bay after a deadline had passed.

WHITEHOUSE COMMENTS ON ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S IRAQ SURGE
  A year after President Bush's speech to the nation announcing that he would significantly increase U.S. troop levels in Iraq, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) criticized the administration's continued failure to change course and begin bringing our troops home: 
  ""In 2006, the American people sent a clear message to Washington that it was time to seek a new direction in Iraq. Instead, a year ago today President Bush escalated the war, sending tens of thousands more troops into harm's way with assurances that the leaders of Iraq would step forward and work towards political reconciliation. Today, one year later, our troops have performed their duties as directed with skill and bravery - but the Iraqis have not done their part, and the Bush administration has not in its own conduct measured up to their sacrifice. 
  ""Iraq will never stand up until we prepare to stand down. I have told President Bush personally that the prospect of an American redeployment is our best pressure on Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for the security and governance of their country. America cannot continue pouring billions of dollars and thousands of lives and limbs into the sands and marshes of Iraq. The Bush Administration cannot shirk the tough choices it must make. We must announce the process of bringing our troops home.""

   ""Selection for the Senate Youth Program is an important achievement, and I'm proud that David and Miranda have taken advantage of this opportunity to learn more about their government,"" Whitehouse said.
   Ms. Cummings, a member of the National Honor Society, is a Student Council member at East Providence High School. She is also the editor of the school newspaper and participates in the French Club and the Drug Intervention Community Educators. Miranda plans to attend Providence College and major in social work.
   Mr. Thibodeau is the class president at LaSalle Academy. He is also an academic tutor, student council representative, and newspaper reporter, and he works as a page in the Rhode Island State Senate. At LaSalle, he is a member of the Academic Decathlon Team, New England Math and Calculus League, National Italian Honor Society, and Academic Honor Society. He plans to major in chemistry.
   The Senate Youth Program was created in 1962. The program is sponsored by the Senate and has been fully funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation since its inception. Each year, 104 students are selected on the basis of merit (two from each state, the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity) to participate in USSYP's week-long, intensive study of the federal government, aimed at fostering a greater understanding of the political process and a strong commitment to public service. To date, more than 4,500 students have participated.

  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) commented today on the long-awaited report by General David Petraeus on the Bush administration's ""surge"" strategy in Iraq:  
  ""It's time to send a clear signal to Iraq and the rest of the world that we are bringing our troops home. We're facing a simple question: is it in our country's best interests for our troops to remain in Iraq? From everything I've seen and heard, the answer is no - and for that reason, it's time to begin a rapid, responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.
  ""In today's report by General Petraeus, the Bush administration argues that security in Iraq is improving - but with 160,000 American troops on the ground and more than $700 billion spent, we should expect some progress of some kind. What has not improved is the political environment necessary for Iraq to begin to stabilize and move forward. Nothing fundamental will change in Iraq unless its leaders have the will to work together.
  ""Our troops need to come home. Then, we can return our focus to issues here at home - from better health care to more affordable education to renewable sources of energy - that will challenge our nation's strength and security for years to come, and where we are losing ground because of this war.""

WHITEHOUSE URGES BUSH FOR NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with President Bush on Wednesday, April 11, to share firsthand the concerns of thousands of Rhode Islanders who believe we need a change of course in Iraq. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently traveled to Iraq as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  
   ""Rhode Islanders, and people throughout the country, have sent a clear message to this administration: it's time for a new direction in Iraq,"" Whitehouse said. ""Today, I had the chance to deliver that message to the President in person. I told him that we want to bring our troops home, and urged him to consider that the strongest force he has at his disposal for a resolution in Iraq is to announce a redeployment and a change of course."" 
   Whitehouse also gave President Bush several letters sent to him by Rhode Islanders concerned about the Bush administration's misguided policy in Iraq. 
   A Cumberland woman whose nephew is serving in Iraq wrote to the President: ""I am proud to be an American! Please, please on behalf of my family and the families of all US troops - bring them home now!"" 
   A woman from Harrisville wrote as her family member was waiting to be deployed: ""Our enemies want us to be mired in a pointless war, wasting our resources and our young people. They want us hurting. Withdrawing from Iraq is the smart thing to do, and that is what our enemies fear most."" 
   A Johnston man whose son is serving in Iraq wrote: ""We the majority of the American people oppose this war and the escalation of troops, even our Generals both active and retired say the escalation of our troops will not help. It is time to bring our men home!"" 
   Several members of Congress were invited to meet with the President following recent official visits to Iraq. Whitehouse traveled there in mid-March on an official congressional delegation visit to meet with American troops and assess the situation on the ground. While in country, he talked with American military commanders, including General David Petraeus, as well as several high-ranking Iraqi officials and members of the U.S. embassy and intelligence staffs. Whitehouse also spoke with Marines from Rhode Island now serving in Fallujah. 
   Whitehouse joined a majority of the Senate to pass war funding legislation that would compel President Bush to begin redeploying American troops from Iraq within four months, with a goal of having all combat troops out of the country by March 31, 2008. Whitehouse also is a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that will limit funding for the war after April 2008 to counter-terrorism, training, and force protection.

   We write regarding the potential closing of the Portuguese consulate in Rhode Island. 
   As United States Senators, we fully understand the financial pressures which require your decision to cut back on some foreign consulates. However, we would like to highlight the invaluable services the Providence consulate provides to the thousands of citizens of Portuguese descent in New England and how the consulate strengthens the bond between our two nations. 
   The Portuguese consulate in Providence has proved critical in informing residents of the state and the nation about Portugal's policies and concerns and its view of U.S. policy. The consulate offers regular communication with official representatives of the Portuguese government and enhances the ability of the Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island to act together on behalf of these concerns. We and our staffs, as well as our constituents, have also found it useful to work with consular officials on a whole range of subjects. 
   The Portuguese American citizens of Rhode Island are dedicated, loyal Americans who contribute to our economy, while they continue to be proud of their Portuguese heritage, which is celebrated so vibrantly in Rhode Island. They rely on the Consulate for innumerable services. Many have contacted me to express their great concern about the potential loss of this valuable resource. While there is consular service in Boston, it is not necessarily easy for those in my state who are in need of consular services to travel there. In addition, the Providence Consulate has proved extremely valuable to my office, including on immigration issues. With Congress poised to consider potential changes in the U.S. immigration system, we foresee even more utilization of the consulate in the future. There is no substitute, even in the day of modern communications, for easy direct personal access among people who share important official concerns. 
   We understand this is a difficult decision that you must make together with your colleagues. However, we hope you will consider all that the Providence consulate provides to the state of Rhode Island and a significant Portuguese-American population. 
   Please feel free to contact us with any questions you may have, and thank you for your consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   Jack Reed 
  United States Senator
   Sheldon Whitehouse 
  United States Senator.

  President Bush's irresponsible fiscal policies have cost America a staggering $7.7 trillion, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today in remarks delivered on the Senate floor during debate on the Senate's budget resolution. Whitehouse said that the ""Bush Debt,"" a comprehensive account of the impact of surpluses squandered and new debt accumulated over the seven years under President Bush, demonstrates the need for new priorities and fiscal discipline as Congress considers the last budget resolution it will pass under the Bush presidency. 
   ""Instead of keeping our nation on the path to economic security and prosperity, to new investments in our health care system, our students, our seniors, and our veterans, the President who called for 'responsibility' squandered away the surpluses he inherited, mortgaged our children and grandchildren's futures, and compromised the quality of working Americans' lives,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. ""This President will leave behind millions of Americans who, had this Administration merely stayed the course of fiscal responsibility charted by President Clinton, would be far better off than they are today.""
   The ""Bush Debt"" was derived from a calculation of the difference between projections of the nation's fiscal outlook had policies in place under President Clinton been allowed to continue, and the reality under President Bush today. Whitehouse found that Bush's misguided policies, from the war in Iraq to tax breaks for the wealthy, have cost America $7.7 trillion in foregone surpluses and new debt.
   The President's budget for fiscal year 2009 also includes $260 billion in interest payments on the debt next year alone, or $857 for every woman, man, and child in the United States. These massive interest payments take away federal funds that could otherwise be used to benefit the American people. If that $260 billion were available to be spent for other purposes, Whitehouse said, we could provide health insurance to every uninsured American, double the maximum Pell Grant award, cover all remaining children eligible for Head Start, and fix virtually all the nation's bridges in need of repair.
   This week, the Senate is debating a budget resolution that would chart a very different course. This proposal, passed Thursday by the Senate Budget Committee, increases funding for veterans, schools, and transportation infrastructure and provides for a second economic stimulus package to help working families facing continued financial hardship. It would also lower taxes for the middle class and create jobs.

SNOWE, SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS URGE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO CORRECT UNFAIR TRADE, ECONOMIC IMBALANCES
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) joined a bipartisan group of 16 of her Senate Finance Committee colleagues in urging the Chinese Government to take action to help redress key economic imbalances between the United States and China. The Senators sent a letter to Vice Premier Wu Yi on the eve of the upcoming meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) that is set to take place in Washington on April 11th. 
   ""Now is the time for the imbalances in our nation's economic relationship with China to be addressed. The fact that we have a record $200 billion trade deficit is a clear indication that steps must be taken by the Government of China to level the playing field, so American industry is not put at an unfair disadvantage,"" said Snowe. ""I'm pleased to join with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to press for real results before the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade takes place in Washington next week.""  
   The Senators specifically note that a failure by China to address key outstanding concerns creates ""the risk of serious damage,"" and ask Vice Premier Wu Yi to make meaningful commitments to: 
   achieve significant, verifiable, and sustained reductions in piracy, counterfeiting, and other infringements of intellectual property rights (""IPR""), specifically ending the production of pirated optical discs and stepping up dramatically IPR enforcement at trade fairs; increase the flexibility of the RMB and allow it to demonstrate greater responsiveness to market forces; increase transparency in government subsidies and reduce government intervention in the marketplace; lift China's WTO-inconsistent ban on U.S. beef; and join, by a date certain, the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. 
   The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdictional control over the nation's tax and trade policies. Last week, the Committee held a hearing reviewing the U.S.-China economic relationship. 
   The members of the Committee that signed the letter are: Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Craig Thomas (R-WY), Blanche Lincoln (D-AK), Rick Santorum (R-PA), Kent Conrad (D-ND), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), John Kerry (D-MA), Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Jim Jeffords (I-VT), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Trent Lott (R-MS) and Bill Frist (R-TN). 
   The US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade was established in 1983 as a forum for high-level dialogue on bilateral trade issues and a vehicle for promoting commercial relations. The JCCT works to resolve problems affecting US companies and serves as an umbrella for trade events and World Trade Organization (WTO) technical assistance programs. The JCCT is co-chaired by US Secretary of Commerce and China's Minister of Commerce. 
   Below is the full text of the letter to Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi: 
   Her Excellency Wu Yi 
   Vice Premier 
   State Council, Central Government 
   Beijing, P.R. China 
   Dear Madam Vice Minister: 
   As members of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees U.S. trade policy in the United States Senate, we write on the eve of the upcoming meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (""JCCT"") to urge your government to take actions that would help redress key economic imbalances between the United States and China. Over the years, you have demonstrated strong leadership to strengthen trans-Pacific economic ties, and we appreciate the commitments you have undertaken at past JCCT meetings to address important obstacles to U.S.-China trade. 
   Today, we look to your leadership to help resolve serious problems that face our trade and economic relationship - symbolized by the record $200 billion trade deficit that the United States posted last year with China, the largest deficit between any two countries in history. It was obvious at last week's Senate Finance Committee hearing that serious questions exist regarding the value of China's currency and China's compliance with its commitments in the World Trade Organization (""WTO""). Ambassador Portman also noted in his recent review of China trade policy that our relationship lacks ""equity, durability and balance."" 
   Our economic relationship is now at a critical point, and failure by China to address key outstanding trade concerns and fulfill longstanding commitments creates the risk of serious damage. As you prepare for the JCCT meeting, we encourage you to bear this risk in mind and come to Washington prepared to make meaningful commitments to: 
   achieve significant, verifiable, and sustained reductions in piracy, counterfeiting, and other infringements of intellectual property rights (""IPR""), specifically ending the production of pirated optical discs and stepping up dramatically IPR enforcement at trade fairs; increase the flexibility of the RMB and allow it to demonstrate greater responsiveness to market forces; increase transparency in government subsidies and reduce government intervention in the marketplace; lift China's WTO-inconsistent ban on U.S. beef; and join, by a date certain, the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. We look to China to take expeditious action on these issues as a way to put our countries on a path to a healthier and more stable trade, economic, and political relationship.

SNOWE-BENNETT BILL HELPS SMALL BUSINESSES OBTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-UT), today introduced the Small Business Health Education and Awareness Act of 2006, legislation that provides matching grants between $150,000 and $300,000 to Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) nationwide in order to increase awareness regarding health insurance options for small businesses.  
   ""The explosive growth in health insurance premiums continues to suffocate small businesses throughout America,"" said Senator Snowe. ""We've now experienced double-digit percentage increases in health insurance premiums in four of the past five years. Limited competition and few choices today prevent millions of small businesses from purchasing quality, affordable health insurance. It is time for Congress to act."" 
   ""This legislation is an important step towards assisting small businesses as they strive to remain competitive with larger businesses that already have the freedom to offer affordable health insurance to their employees,"" stated Senator Snowe. 
   Senator Snowe noted that study after study has found that the smallest businesses are least likely to offer insurance and most in need of assistance. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 60.6 percent of the nearly 38 million working uninsured either work for a small business with fewer than 100 employees or are self-employed. 
   Senator Snowe's bill establishes a pilot, competitive matching-grant program for SBDCs to increase small business awareness regarding health insurance options available in their areas. Recent research conducted by the Healthcare Leadership Council has found that a short educational briefing can increase the likelihood that small businesses will offer health insurance, by approximately 33 percent. The grants under Senator Snowe's bill would be for SBDCs to develop short presentations to help encourage small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees 
   The legislation requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make up to 20 matching grants to SBDCs across the country. No more than two SBDCs (one per state) would be chosen from each of the SBA's 10 regions. The grants must be more than $150,000, but less than $300,000 and be consistent with the matching requirement under current law. In creating the materials for their grant programs, participating SBDCs will evaluate and incorporate relevant resources detailing existing health insurance options. In addition, SBDCs participating in the pilot program would be required to submit a quarterly report to the SBA. 
   SBDCs are valuable business assistance partners provide entrepreneurs with resources so they can start and grow a small business. Currently, there are over 1,100 service locations in every state and territory delivering management and technical counseling to prospective and existing small business owners.

SNOWE DISPLEASED PROVISION INCLUDED FOR OFF-SHORE WIND FARMS
  Late last night the House-Senate Coast Guard Authorization Conference Committee, of which Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) is a member, approved the Coast Guard Conference Report - clearing the way for final passage of this legislation by both Congressional chambers. 
   The Conference Report authorizes $8.7 billion for Fiscal Year 2006. The authorization bill allow the Coast Guard to perform non-homeland security missions such as search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and marine environmental protection, as well as fund the necessary missions related to ports, waterways, and coastal security.  
   ""With this Conference Report, the Congress has acted to shore up the Coast Guard at a time when it has been stretched too thin to meet its various responsibilities,"" said Snowe. ""The Coast Guard has the unenviable job of performing its traditional search and rescue and fisheries enforcement missions, while also protecting our nation's borders from terrorist infiltration - all with an aging and undersized fleet. I believe that this conference report has included essential funding that the Coast Guard has so desperately needed for too long."" 
   While Snowe, who is chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Fisheries and the Coast Guard, is pleased that this legislation passed its final hurdle on its way to final passage, she believes that a special interest provision in the bill to allow the Governor of Massachusetts to have final veto authority over a wind power project in Nantucket Sound should not have been included in this legislation. 
   ""I do not believe that we should have included a provision in this conference report to allow the Governor of Massachusetts to have final veto authority over a wind power project in Nantucket Sound,"" said Snowe. ""There could well be legitimate concerns about the feasibility of off-shore wind farms. But that necessitates a full-scale review through the normal committee process, not through a closed conference committee. Despite my objections, this provision remained in the legislation."" 
   The Conference Report includes numerous measures that would allow the Coast Guard to enforce provisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, an essential element in securing the nation's ports, waterways, and transportation networks. Additionally, it would address maritime safety issues by allowing the Coast Guard to continue training both the commercial fishing industry and the recreational boating public in issues regarding safety at sea. 
   As a reflection of its support of the Coast Guard recapitalizing its fleet of cutters and aircraft, the Conference Report authorizes $1.3 billion for the Coast Guard's Deepwater Program. Snowe has long fought to accelerate the Deepwater Program and is pleased that this funding has been included. 
   ""It is beyond question that the Deepwater Program is an essential component of allowing the Coast Guard to protect our borders. I am pleased that we included this funding and vow to continue the fight to ensure that the Coast Guard is able to protect our nation,"" said Snowe. 
   In response to the final report of the United States Commission on Ocean Policy, the Conference Report includes provisions that would allow the Coast Guard to work with other federal, state, and local agencies in developing plans to assist vessels in distress, thus eliminating the potential for loss of life and environmental damage. It also directs the Coast Guard to develop steps that will allow it to better detect and interdict foreign vessels that are violating fishing regulations. 
   The Conference Report also includes the following highlights: 
   Authorizes a supplemental $300 million for Coast Guard operations and maintenance associated with Katrina, as well as for the increased costs of fuel. 
   Authorizes a supplemental $200 million for capital improvements for Coast Guard facilities in Fiscal Year 2006, including air and vessel assets, and for equipment that needs to be replaced, including aids to navigation to ensure safe transits through shipping lanes. 
   Officially commends the Coast Guard for its exemplary response to Hurricane Katrina and calls for the Coast Guard to play a major role in any future national emergency or natural disaster. 
   Authorizes the Coast Guard to use its maritime safety and security teams for missions other than security missions, such as response to natural disasters like Katrina. 
   Extends the use of annual leave for Coast Guard members involved in the response effort to Hurricane Katrina. 
   Requires the Coast Guard to report to Congress on Katrina's impact on Coast Guard operations and facilities and on navigable waterways, facilities located in such waterways, and on the environment. 
   Raises the liability limits for responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act.

SNOWE SUPPORTS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FOR STATES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) and 40 of her colleagues recently sent a letter to Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security Chairman Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) and Ranking Member Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV) to request $235 million in funding for the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. 
   ""It is absolutely imperative that states and local governments have adequate funding to support an effective emergency response system in the event of disaster,"" said Snowe. ""Given the realities of our post September 11 world, it only makes sense for the federal government to provide grants to states to help them prepare for an emergency. I have long supported the Emergency Management Performance Grant program because it allows states the flexibility to institute a localized response structure that will keep residents safe and out of harms way if catastrophe hits.""  
   The full text of the letter follows: 
   Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Byrd: 
   We are writing to request an increase in funding for the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program in the FY07 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. We request that you fund the EMPG program at $235 million. 
   The EMPG program was created to assist in developing an effective emergency response system at the state and local government level to handle disasters and emergencies of all types and sizes. It provides the only source of federal assistance to states and localities to develop and build their emergency management capabilities. The EMPG program gives the flexibility to allocate funds according to risk, thus addressing the most urgent state and local needs. The program is a pass through grant that is matched dollar for dollar by state and local governments. 
   Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the EMPG program has been used to increase state and local preparedness around the country. In August of last year, Hurricane Katrina dramatically demonstrated the increased need for every state and local government to have strong emergency management capability in preparation for all disasters. The EMPG program supports this need. Despite this need, the EMPG program has been historically underfunded. A 2004 survey conducted by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) concluded that the program faces a $264 million shortfall. State and local governments cannot be expected to take on the ever growing homeland security mission without adequate resources to do the job. While we recognize the current fiscal situation and pressures to reduce spending, it is critical that we provide adequate funding for this program. 
   We would like to thank you for your attention to the EMPG program and the support for an increase of $5 million in the Department of Homeland Security FY06 appropriations, for a total of $185 million. We are pleased that you have set a precedent for increased funding of the EMPG program. Unfortunately, the President's budget request represents an approximately $13 million cut to this vital program. Not only should this cut from FY06 be restored, but we request that you increase funding for the EMPG program an additional $50 million for a total of $235 million, to begin to address the shortfall identified by NEMA. 
   Additionally, we request that your subcommittee maintain the EMPG program as a separate and distinct program. 
   Thank you for your consideration of this request to fund the EMPG program at $235 million for FY2007. We look forward to working with you on this important program.

SNOWE VOICES SUPPORT FOR OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE AND SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, today expressed her support for federal offshore aquaculture legislation and its potential economic, environmental, and health benefits at a National Ocean Policy Study Subcommittee Hearing on Offshore Aquaculture. Sebastian Belle, Executive Director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, testified at the hearing. 
   ""Offshore aquaculture has the potential to provide myriad economic, environmental, and health benefits to citizens throughout our country,"" said Snowe. ""My home state of Maine is already at the forefront of exploring this new way of satisfying the demand for seafood without over harvesting our ocean resources. I believe that Congress must encourage environmentally sound forms of aquaculture for our coastal communities as well as provide an appropriate regulatory framework for the industry so that we can continue to benefit from this growing segment of the seafood industry.""  
   The following is Snowe's statement as prepared for delivery: 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for convening today's hearing on offshore aquaculture. The State of Maine has decades of experience in fish farming, especially in near-shore state waters, and we recognize that this industry could soon have new opportunities to pursue aquaculture in offshore, federal waters. Therefore, this timely hearing will help ensure that Congress understands the issues and challenges facing this emerging industry, so we can authorize an appropriate federal framework for developing and promoting offshore aquaculture. 
   Before we discuss the specific issues of the legislative proposals for regulating fish farming, we should take a step back and look at the global dimensions of seafood production and demand. The United Nations tells us that 60 percent of the world's fisheries are either depleted or fully exploited, yet global demand for seafood - a healthy source of protein - continues to grow, perhaps up to 70 percent in the coming decades. Not surprisingly, the world is looking to aquaculture to meet this ever-increasing demand. 
   While many countries, especially in Asia, have developed aggressive policies on fish farming, the United States has not kept pace. Less than 40 percent of our seafood is produced domestically, making the U.S. very reliant on imported seafood - a majority of which comes from foreign aquaculture. This makes it possible for us to enjoy easy and affordable access to our favorite seafood dinners, but this convenience and nutrition does not come without costs. 
   For example, after several decades of industrial aquaculture around the world, we have seen that large-scale fish farming may lead to marine pollution and habitat loss if it is not done correctly. Fish raised at high densities can also transmit disease more easily, which may necessitate the use of antibiotics and other medicines. And considering that many farm-raised species have limited genetic diversity, they can expose wild stocks to a host of risks - from interbreeding or co-mingling of wild stocks with potentially unhealthy fish. 
   The experience of aquaculture in Maine has cast a spotlight on many of these issues, but at the same time it provides examples of how the industry can address and overcome problems like disease and escapement. Today, nearly 150 aquaculture operations in Maine grow Atlantic salmon, oysters, mussels, and other commercially valuable seafood, growing products worth more than $80 million annually. As a pioneer in this field, Maine is finding ways to create jobs in coastal communities and sustain a vital component of the seafood economy, and ongoing research is pointing to new ways to support this industry's expansion. 
   Despite these potential challenges, the economic and public health benefits that could accompany aquaculture and the value of it in Maine make it worthwhile for us to consider the future of this industry in the United States. Currently, there is no federal framework specifically designed to address the unique regulatory issues surrounding offshore aquaculture, so in building one we must seek to prevent the mistakes and shortcomings of the past from being repeated. The administration's proposed bill for offshore aquaculture moves us in this direction, as it proposes a number of criteria aimed at ensuring environmental protection and sustainable fish farming development. 
   It is now our responsibility to critically examine this proposed bill, listen to the expert testimony provided to us today, and chart a way forward through these complex - and potentially controversial - issues. I am impressed with the caliber of the panel assembled here today, and I thank all the witnesses for appearing - Dr. Bill Hogarth of the National Marine Fisheries Service; Dr. Richard Langan of the University of New Hampshire; Mr. Randy Cates, president of Cates International, all the way from Hawaii; Mr. Mark Vinsel of the United Fishermen of Alaska; and Dr. Rebecca Goldburg of Environmental Defense. And of course, I am very grateful that our Chairman has invited Sebastian Belle, Executive Director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, to testify before us today. Sebastian, I am confident that your testimony will shed light on many of the key issues in the already complicated state-federal regulatory environment of this industry.

SNOWE SUPPORTS INCREASED KIDNEY CANCER RESEARCH
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe and 19 of her colleagues recently sent a letter to Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Chairman Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-HI) requesting that they increase funding for kidney cancer research and, more specifically, provide $15 million within the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill.  
   ""Kidney cancer is a deadly disease that is affecting increasing numbers of Americans,"" said Snowe. ""We must support research efforts that will allow medical professionals to diminish both the scope and impact of this cancer. Without the development of new tests and treatment options, those who suffer from kidney cancer will have few options for fighting this disease."" 
   The full text of the letter follows: 
   Dear Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye: 
   We are writing to respectfully request your support for increasing funding for kidney cancer research and specifically ask that you provide $15 million within the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program for this purpose in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Appropriations bill. 
   Kidney cancer has not received the public attention that other diseases have, though it affects a large number of people. With an estimated 12,000 deaths and 36,000 new cases in 2005, kidney cancer has, among the 20 most common cancers, the fourth highest rising incidence among women and the fifth highest among men. We hope you will consider our request to invest in diagnostic tests and new treatment options for those who suffer from this disease. 
   Mortality rates for kidney cancer patients are disturbingly high due to the lack of screening techniques that would provide early diagnosis coupled with the limited treatments that are currently available to fight the disease. Interleukin-2, the only FDA-approved drug for metastatic kidney cancer that has a durable response, has only a 5% cure rate. Unlike other types of cancer, no therapy currently exists to prevent future recurrence of kidney cancer once patients are in remission. 
   Kidney cancer is a devastating illness with inadequate treatment options that deserves dedicated research funding supported by the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. We thank you for your consideration, and look forward to a day when real hope will exist for the tens of thousands of Americans who suffer from kidney cancer.

SNOWE HIGHLIGHTS URGENCY OF HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES AFFORD HEALTH PLANS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AT FINANCE COMMITTEE HEARING ON APRIL 10
  At a Finance Committee hearing today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), Chair of Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, cited the overwhelming burden that skyrocketing health care costs are imposing on the nation's small businesses and pressed for full Senate action on Small Business Health Plans (SBHP) also known as Association Health Plans. 
   Snowe has long fought to find common-sense ways to help small business provide health care to their employees. As such, Snowe joined with a committed group of her Senate colleagues in introducing the Small Business Health Fairness Act. This legislation would allow small businesses to pool together nationally, through Small Business Health Plans, to provide employees with quality health insurance at affordable costs. Panelists at the hearing included Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC), Todd McCracken, President, National Small Business Association, among others. 
   The following is Snowe's statement as prepared for delivery:  
   The small business health insurance crisis is real and is an undue burden on entrepreneurs throughout America. This is not a crisis that appeared overnight. Nearly 46 million Americans are now uninsured. And for the past decade - as health insurance premiums have increased at double digit percentage levels and far outpaced inflation and wage gains - Congress has failed to act. Even when study after study confirms beyond a doubt that fewer and fewer small businesses are able to offer health insurance to their employees, little has been done to alleviate the problem. Quite simply, that's outrageous. 
   The time for talking has long since passed. No more excuses, no more laments, no more complaining, no more describing a problem and doing nothing about it. I think we all can agree that we must provide small businesses in Maine, Montana, and Iowa - and in every state across our great land - with access to quality, affordable health insurance. 
   I believe that we need to focus on solutions that are achievable, tested, and fiscally prudent. I have introduced legislation, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, that would achieve this goal, through a common sense approach that would allow small businesses to pool together nationally, through Small Business Health Plans (SBHPs) that provide employees with quality health insurance at affordable costs. SBHPs will bring fairness to employer health coverage by giving participating small businesses the same advantages of Federal law currently enjoyed by larger businesses and unions. 
   I am encouraged by the considerable progress that has been made on SBHPs in this Senate - we're further along on this issue than we have ever been. But we need to go the distance, which is passing legislation that President Bush can finally sign into law. I would like to commend Senator Mike Enzi for his ongoing commitment to the SBHP issue, and for successfully marking-up SBHP legislation in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   I believe that Senator Enzi's bill is a good step forward so that we can consider this important issue on the Senate floor. I do, however, have a number of concerns with Senator Enzi's approach. First, Senator Enzi's bill fails to include a self-insured SBHP component. The ability for an SBHP to self-insure, like a large employer can, is a key component of my bill. It would inject much-needed competition into stagnant, dysfunctional small group insurance markets. It would also provide more options for small businesses when it comes to providing quality, affordable health insurance for their employees. To opponents of this approach I ask: What's wrong with competition? What's wrong with giving small businesses more choices when it comes to purchasing health insurance? 
   Second, I am concerned that a national rating standard would preempt the states' rights to regulate insurance within their borders. Under my SBHP legislation, the state insurance commissioners would rate insurance products sold in their states. Many states, including my home state of Maine, have opted to rate insurance products based on the most recent standard put out by the National Association Insurance Commissioners. 
   I also have some concerns with the way Senator Enzi's bill addresses the benefit mandate approach. I believe that associations ought to be able to tailor their SBHPs to the wants, needs, and desires of their members, but I have concerns that the high-option, low-cost option approach might lead to adverse selection and an unlevel playing field. And that the high-option approach might be priced far beyond the reach of a typical small business. 
   In the final analysis, I strongly believe that SBHPs are an idea whose time has finally come. And I look forward to debating the SBHP issue on the Senate floor in the coming weeks, and to working with my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle to fashion a bipartisan solution to this crisis. 
   While SBHPs are a crucial solution, they are not the entire solution. Today I would like to discuss several additional steps that this Committee can take, in addition to SBHPs, to help reduce the ranks of America's nearly 46 million uninsured. 
   These steps are commonsense. They are achievable. They don't add layer upon layer to a health care bureaucracy that has no shortage of red tape. And they don't call for a national health insurance program, operated and administered by the Federal government. 
   Instead, we should use the tax code to help resolve the small business health insurance crisis. Just last week I introduced the Small Business Health Insurance Relief Act (S. 2457), a bill that would both (1) provide targeted tax incentives that would encourage our nation's smallest businesses to offer health insurance; and (2) inject much-needed competition into dysfunctional state small group markets. 
   Our nation's smallest businesses - the ""micro"" businesses - are the ones least likely to offer health insurance as a workplace benefit. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Employer Health Benefits 2005 Annual Survey: only 47 percent of the smallest businesses, those with 3 to 9 workers, now offer health insurance as a workplace benefit. This is down from 52 percent in 2004, and 58 percent in 2002. Clearly, for small businesses, things are trending in the wrong direction. In sharp contrast, 98 percent of larger businesses, those with 200 or more workers, offer health insurance as a benefit. 
   My legislation would establish a targeted tax credit that would encourage the smallest businesses - those most desperately in need of relief - to purchase insurance coverage for their employees. The maximum tax credit under the proposal would be $1,500 for single coverage and $3,000 for family coverage. The tax credit would phase out as a business increases in size and is neutral between types of insurance: either traditional employer-sponsored health insurance or funding health savings accounts (HSAs) of their employees. 
   Under my legislation, a small business with five employees would be eligible for a per-participant tax credit of $3,000 for a family health insurance plan, and a potential total tax credit of $15,000. Small businesses cite escalating cost as the number one impediment to providing health insurance. Putting $15,000 in the hands of a small business owner could certainly help to overcome this barrier. 
   Second, my legislation would increase competition in state small group health insurance markets. There is no competition among insurers in the small group markets, with coverage and affordability the real problems. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) survey I recently requested, along with Senators Christopher Bond and Jim Talent, reported a frightening consolidation of control over state insurance markets. The five largest carriers now have more than 75 percent market share in 26 states (up from 19 in 2002) and more than 90 percent market share in 12 states (as opposed to 7 in 2002). Blue Cross and Blue Shield carriers now control 43 percent of the small group markets (up from 33 percent in 2002). 
   In my home state of Maine, Anthem Blue Cross now controls 63 percent of the small group market, and the five largest carriers put together dominate 98 percent. 
   To counter this market consolidation, my legislation would provide insurers with a 50 percent tax deduction for claims and expenses incurred in serving the small group market or Small Business Health Plans (SBHPs) and would provide a per state tax credit to defray the cost of state licensing requirements. These incentives are open to all insurers, and would motivate new insurers to enter and compete in the dysfunctional small group market and service SBHPs. 
   Together with SBHP legislation, I believe that these proposals could help solve the small business health insurance crisis. Simply put, our small businesses need choices as they seek to obtain affordable health insurance. In the coming weeks, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion, with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to push these proposals through the Senate. 
   I look forward to hearing the ideas and reactions of this distinguished panel.

SNOWE'S BILL HONORING SMALL BUSINESSES, SBA
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME), chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today announced the Senate has passed a resolution honoring America's small businesses and the Small Business Administration in advance of National Small Business Week, which begins April 9th. The resolution passed unanimously.  
   ""From family farms to software development, small businesses form the backbone of our economy and provide much of the innovation that moves our country forward,"" said Snowe. ""Americans who assume the risk and responsibilities inherent in owning and operating a business deserve our praise and admiration. To ensure that the spirit of entrepreneurship remains strong in America, we should give small businesses the support they need to thrive."" 
   Snowe's bill honors America's 25 million small businesses and the tremendous contributions they make to our economy and way of life. It also highlights the SBA's pivotal role in overseeing the delivery of financial and business development tools for millions of aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small businesses across the United States. 
   ""The SBA has been a critical partner to millions of small enterprises as well as aspiring entrepreneurs as they embark on the path to prosperity and job creation,"" said Snowe. ""We must strengthen the SBA's core loan and technical assistance programs that have proven time and again to be a cornerstone in aiding the efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs.""

ROCKEFELLER DEMANDS THAT CHINA PLAY FAIR ON TRADE
  With joint trade talks set to begin tomorrow between the United States and China, Sen. Jay Rockefeller and a bi-partisan group of 16 U.S. Senators are calling for the Chinese government to commit to a series of changes that would make trade fairer between the two countries. Under an artificially-devalued currency, Chinese companies are able to sell goods at lower prices, creating a $200 billion trade deficit - the largest in world history - for the U.S. Senators also want the Chinese to stop crippling the American music industry and open its markets to U.S. beef. 
   Administration officials will meet Tuesday with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi in a daylong meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade - the forum for the U.S.-China talks.
   ""Our economic relationship is now at a critical point and failure by China to address key outstanding trade concerns and fulfill longstanding commitments creates the risk of serious damage,"" Rockefeller and the Senators wrote the Vice Premier.
   Among the areas where the Senators demanded the Chinese make meaningful commitments to fairer trade include:
   Halting the pirating of American music and other infringements of American intellectual property.
   Lifting China's ban on U.S. beef, a ban inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules and regulations.
   Reduce government intervention in the marketplace.
   Increasing the flexibility of the yuan - a move that is not only more responsive to true market forces, but would enable American companies to compete with Chinese companies.
   ""We look to your leadership to help resolve serious problems that face our trade and economic relationship - symbolized by the record $200 billion trade deficit that the United States posted last year with China, the largest deficit between any two countries in history,"" Rockefeller and the Senators wrote. ""It was obvious at last week's Senate Finance Committee hearing that serious questions exist regarding the value of China's currency and China's compliance with its commitments in the World Trade Organization.""
   Rockefeller is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees U.S. trade policy.

ROCKEFELLER VOTES IN FAVOR OF FORECLOSURE RELIEF LEGISLATION
  Over the objections of President Bush, and in an effort to address the growing home foreclosure crisis, the U.S. Senate has passed legislation cosponsored by Senator Jay Rockefeller aimed at helping West Virginia families and veterans stay in their homes and rebuild neighborhoods that have a surplus of vacant property. The Foreclosure Prevention Act passed the U.S. Senate today by a vote of 84-12. 
    ""The legislation that we passed today has the potential to bring some real peace of mind to those West Virginia families that are struggling each month to keep a roof over their heads,"" Rockefeller said. ""Our nation is in the grips of a crippling housing crisis, and the dream of homeownership should never turn into a nightmare of unpredictable interest rates and declining property values.""
   To keep struggling families in their homes, the Foreclosure Prevention Act provides additional federal funding for housing counselors, offers new options for homeowners to refinance out of subprime loans, and allows returning veterans more time to make mortgage payments and one-year relief from increases in mortgage interest rates. 
   President Bush has objected to a part of the bill that would provide billions of dollars in additional funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). States and local communities would be able to use CDBG funds to purchase foreclosed homes from lenders that can be resold or leased to families. By reducing the number of vacant homes in a neighborhood, existing homeowners will see their property values remain the same or increase. 
   ""In the midst of a recession, the President applauds the Federal Reserve's decision to spend $30 billion to shore-up failing businesses on Wall Street. But ultimately that expense is going to be passed on the taxpayer and grow our national debt,"" Rockefeller said. ""Rather than criticize congressional efforts to rebuild our communities, improve property values, and keep families and veterans in their homes, the President should be working with us."" 
   The bill also takes a number of steps to prevent a future mortgage crisis by improving the disclosure of information given to borrowers when they receive a mortgage or refinance, enabling them to make better, more informed decisions about their loans.
   The Foreclosure Prevention Act includes a number of important tax relief provisions aimed at jump-starting the ailing housing market. These include: a federal standard property tax deduction for West Virginia homeowners who don't itemize; increased bond authority to allow municipalities to refinance subprime loans and provide mortgages for first-time homebuyers and multifamily rental housing; an extension of the Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryback to help aid homebuilders and businesses hit hardest by the economic slump; and a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of homes already in foreclosure.
   The Foreclosure Prevention Act now moves to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration. Senator Rockefeller, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, is an original cosponsor of the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.

   ""I believe the war in Iraq has diverted resources and undercut the Bush Administration's ability to protect our people against a terrorist attack. 
   ""I remain deeply troubled by the lack of progress since 9/11 in securing our nation's airports and seaports. The Administration's record on homeland security is one of insufficient funding and mismanagement.""

  Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) issued the following statement in response to comments made by President Bush earlier this afternoon on reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Senator Rockefeller co-authored the legislation that created CHIP in 1997. Earlier this year, he submitted legislation that would reauthorize that program for another 5 years.  
   ""It's no surprise to anyone that our nation's health care system is broken. But, whatever your view is on how best to reform the system, I believe that one thing is perfectly clear - our children should come first and their healthcare must be protected. 
   ""For a decade, CHIP has succeeded in meeting the health care needs of millions of children. Through the CHIP program, states are provided with the resources they need to take care of one of our most vulnerable populations. As a result, millions of children have received routine healthcare checkups, immunizations, and screenings to give kids a healthy start in life. You can't duplicate that kind of security through the tax code, despite the President's wishful thinking. 
   ""It's time for the President to get serious about children's health care and work with Congress to give families the peace of mind that they deserve.""

ROCKEFELLER SUPPORTS REAUTHORIZATION OF WELFARE REFORM
  To build on the historic 1996 welfare reform, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) is supporting a Senate Finance Committee welfare reauthorization bill that would continue to help families move from welfare to work. The PRIDE (Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone) bill reauthorizes the welfare reform law that fundamentally transformed the old system of dependency into a new program focused on moving families into jobs and self-sufficiency. An essential part of this transition to work for many individuals and families is child care, and the bill Rockefeller supports adds $6 billion in new child care funding over the next five years, including $30 million for West Virginia. 
   ""Child care is critical for families moving from welfare to work. Having access to safe, reliable child care is often the difference between being able to enter the workforce or not,"" said Rockefeller. ""This bill makes important investments in child care."" 
   The PRIDE bill helps West Virginia individuals and families move into the workplace in other ways. The bi-partisan bill continues special work rules for mothers with children under 6, so that they have a more flexible 24-hour per week work requirement. The House Republican welfare bill would eliminate the special work rules for mothers with young children and impose a 40 hours work requirement on all parents. 
   The bill also helps move people off the welfare rolls by: 
   * Authorizing $100 million for job creation and job placement programs. 
   * Creating a Parents as Scholars program, allowing up to 10% of recipients to attend college.
   * Expanding Transitional Medicaid Assistance from 1 year to 2 years.
   * Providing publicly-available research on children's well-being data for West Virginia and al l states. 
   * Strengthening child support enforcement to encourage states to give families more of the money collected from non-custodial parents so that families can leave welfare.
   In the 107th Congress, Rockefeller was a leader in welfare reform efforts that supported these ideas, and throughout his career he has been recognized as a leader on welfare reform. During negotiations on President Clinton's landmark 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, Rockefeller served as one of the Senate conferees.

ROCKEFELLER KICKS OFF 'COVER THE UNINSURED WEEK'
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), a nationally recognized leader on health care issues, was invited to deliver remarks at an event to rally awareness for 'Cover the Uninsured Week' Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Rockefeller addressed the need to set aside political differences and work to make certain that uninsured Americans have access to health care.  
   ""An estimated 18,000 people die every year in America because they lack health coverage. That is a very unflattering statistic for a world superpower. It's unnecessary and I'm sure most Americans find it unacceptable,"" Rockefeller said. ""I will continue to fight to make sure every American can get the basic medical treatment they need when they need it."" 
   During the May 10-16 'Cover the Uninsured Week,' nearly 1,500 organized events will take place in communities nationwide, including health and enrollment fairs, seminars for small business owners on how to obtain health coverage for their employees, campus discussions and interfaith events held in places of worship. 
   Rockefeller supported this week's activities by saying, ""We must do whatever we can to get more people covered. We cannot allow so many of our fellow citizens to just fall through the cracks of a deficient health care system."" 
   Rockefeller has a long history of working to obtain health coverage for the nearly 44 million Americans - including 241,700 West Virginians - that do not have health insurance. Rockefeller chaired the Pepper Commission in the late 1980s, which produced bipartisan recommendations on how to achieve universal coverage for both acute and long-term care. He also served on the Children's Commission in the early 1990s, and helped create a bipartisan report with recommendations on how to improve the lives and health coverage of America's children. Additionally, Rockefeller co-authored the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997, which insured 35,000 West Virginian children in 2003 alone. 
   ""We need to get back to higher ground in our discussions about the uninsured,"" Rockefeller said in his speech. ""We need to put aside our allegiance to party, ideology, special interest groups - and put the needs of the uninsured uppermost in our minds. We've done this before, and we can do it again."" 
   Rockefeller is the Chairman of the Alliance for Health Reform, which he founded in 1991 to encourage bipartisan solutions to the problems of the uninsured. Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), Vice-Chairman of the Alliance, also spoke at the event as well as television actor Noah Wyle, who is the volunteer spokesperson for 'Cover the Uninsured Week.'

ROCKEFELLER FAA BILL STRENGTHENS WEST VIRGINIA AVIATION SERVICES
  West Virginia's air transportation industry will benefit under bipartisan legislation co-authored by Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Trent Lott (R-MS) and introduced last week. The Aviation Investment and Modernization (AIM) Act of 2007 will continue to provide essential air service to local communities, invest in airport safety and capacity improvements, restore air traffic controllers' bargaining rights, and establish a national research center to fund coal to jet fuel research.
   Senator Rockefeller, Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee on Commerce, said ""a healthy and modern aviation system is vital to the economic future of countless small and local communities that are linked to the rest of the nation and world through aviation.""  
   ""In West Virginia alone, aviation represents approximately $3.4 billion of the state's gross domestic product, and directly and indirectly employs over 51,000 people,"" Rockefeller said. ""This bill is good for West Virginia and good for the nation."" 
   IMPROVING WEST VIRGINIA AIR SERVICE 
   Experts predict that the current air traffic control system is incapable of handling increased capacity. As a result, by 2015 gridlock in the skies and on the runways will become so bad that its effects will be felt throughout the system - especially at West Virginia's regional airports. Rockefeller said modernization of the system has to be a top priority. 
   ""Given the nature of our aviation system, delays on the runways at O'Hare or Charlotte will be felt by travelers in West Virginia. When congestion increases, small communities are the first to lose flights or service. We must modernize air traffic control systems and build new runways in order to keep commerce and people moving everywhere,"" Rockefeller said. ""The only way to pay for these improvements is to spread the cost fairly among all users of the system."" 
   In order to make the costs more fair, funds will come from a new $25 surcharge for commercial and ""high-end"" general aviation users, such as corporate jets. It's predicted that the new surcharge will generate close to $400 million in revenue over the next four years. These funds would be dedicated to implementing the ""Next Generation Air Traffic Control System"" - the program to replace the existing analog communication system with a state-of-the-art digital system. 
   In addition to modernization, the Rockefeller-Lott bill provides $35 million for the Small Community Air Service Development Program and $133 million to the Essential Air Service program - five West Virginia communities receive approximately $5 million in EAS subsidies annually. 
   Earlier this year, the Bush Administration offered a proposal that would have reduced funding for Airport Improvement Programs (AIP) at 15 of the 17 general aviation airports within West Virginia. Under the AIM act, funding for those airports is restored and greater flexibility is given to facilities to decide how best to spend those funds. The Rockefeller bill continues the AIP cost-sharing formula - 95% federal and 5% local match - for airport projects he first helped to establish in 2003. 
   PROTECTING GENERAL AVIATION 
   Under the Rockefeller-Lott bill, ninety percent of West Virginia's general aviation community will continue to pay the current rate - they will not be subject to the new surcharge or a proposed increase in jet fuel taxes. 
   Unlike the Bush Administration proposal, the Rockefeller-Lott bill does not include a host of user fees for aircraft certification that would have adversely impacted aircraft manufacturers and general aviation. For instance, the Administration proposed increasing fuel taxes to as high as 70 cents on all general aviation users - adversely affecting the West Virginia general aviation community - while at the same time eliminating all taxes and fees on the commercial airlines. 
   In contrast, and in a separate recommendation for the Senate Finance Committee, where Senators Rockefeller and Lott both are senior members, they outlined a proposal that would bring equity to the current system of taxes and fees, where there has been a historical imbalance between the commercial and general aviation fields. 
   The Senators' plan retains existing taxes and fees paid by aviation users. However, over the next five years the 4.3 cents per gallon tax on fuel used by commercial airlines will be phased out. Fuel taxes on ""high-end"" jet aviation will be increased from 21.8 cents to 49.1 cents per gallon. The increase will not apply to piston-engined aircraft - which are flown by the vast majority of West Virginia's recreational fliers. 
   COAL TO JET FUEL RESEARCH 
   The AIM act also establishes a national center of excellence to develop coal to jet fuel technologies. Rockefeller noted that several countries around the world already use fuels derived from coal with great success - and the U.S. military has some projects underway, specifically, the Air Force is already testing the use of Appalachian coal-based jet fuels. 
   Other key provisions in the bill include: providing consumers with information on on-time arrivals and delays from the airline industry, conducting a study on aircraft cabin air quality, and restoring balance and fairness in the FAA labor negotiation process. 
   A hearing on the legislation is scheduled for next week.

  Facing a critical deadline in World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations at the end of the month, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-West Virginia) and Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) called upon the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Portman, to pursue a strong and comprehensive negotiating strategy that will protect American jobs from unfair and illegal foreign trade practices such as dumping and illegal subsidies. 
   In a letter sent this week to Ambassador Portman, Rockefeller and Craig, who were joined by 12 of their Senate colleagues, expressed their concern over the lack of proposals advocated by U.S. negotiators during the Doha Round of negotiations, currently underway in Geneva. The Senators also called upon Portman to follow the clear position of the U.S. Senate and take a tougher stance during the trade talks to protect American interests. The Senate unanimously accepted an amendment by Craig and Rockefeller in November that expressed the sense of Congress that our trade laws must not be undermined in the current round of negotiations.
   America's trade rivals have, so far, dominated the negotiations and have offered approximately 180 proposals that are detrimental to the U.S. economy. The Senators are concerned that American negotiators will be unable to address many of the significant grievances that affect the U.S. economy if they fail to pursue a comprehensive negotiating strategy during the final weeks of negotiations.
   As the Senators wrote:
   ""The continued strength of the trade remedy laws is vital both to our ability to counteract unfair foreign competition and to the health of critical parts of the U.S. manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
   ""We believe that a more comprehensive strategy is needed now in Geneva to makes sure that these important laws are preserved and enhanced. We are now literally down to the final weeks when the U.S. can change the dynamics of these talks - this means putting forward a meaningful, affirmative agenda, right now.""

ROCKEFELLER CONTINUES THE FIGHT TO COVER MORE WEST VIRGINIA CHILDREN THROUGH CHIP
  During a hearing of the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) took aim at a Bush Administration policy that is making it harder for states like West Virginia to provide health care to children through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 
   ""When it comes to reducing the number of uninsured children, states are on the frontlines for delivering comprehensive and affordable health care. They know what works best in their individual states and have developed innovative proposals for guaranteeing coverage for children,"" Rockefeller said.  
   ""That's why I'm so frustrated with the Bush Administration's August 17, 2007 directive that has placed an impossible mandate on states,"" Rockefeller said. ""In my judgment, its aim is simple: to make it virtually impossible for states like West Virginia to provide greater access to health insurance for children.""
   Senator Rockefeller, who co-authored the CHIP program, noted at the hearing that a cornerstone of the program has always been state flexibility. Moreover, at time of growing economic uncertainty, states are struggling to cover those working families who are in need of assistance. This is particularly true when employers are reducing private coverage because of increasing economic pressures. 
   West Virginia has enacted legislation to cover uninsured children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $52,800 a year for a family of three. The state phased in coverage to 220 percent of poverty in January 2007, but has not taken any further steps to implement the planned expansion because of questionable guidance from the Bush Administration known as the August 17 directive. As a result, our state is unable to move forward with its planned expansion of coverage, leaving at least 4,000 West Virginia children uninsured.
   Last year, on August 17, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a letter to states that were attempting to provide health insurance to more children through their CHIP programs. The so-called August 17 directive effectively mandated that any state trying to enroll children in CHIP from families earning more than 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or $44,000 for a family of three, had to first be able to prove that they've covered 95 percent of children in families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level ($35,200 for a family of three). 
   ""The real reason that the Bush Administration crafted this onerous directive is because they knew that they weren't going to get their way during last year's CHIP reauthorization negotiations,"" Rockefeller said. ""With the stroke of a pen, and less than $100 in postage, the Administration has unleashed a tidal wave of financial uncertainty for states and families that will be measured in the loss of billions of dollars in state-aid, and hundreds of thousands of children being denied access to health insurance.""
   No other voluntary federal means-tested program - not the Medicare prescription drug program nor the food stamps program - has enrollment of 95 percent. In fact, only in Medicare Part B, where seniors are automatically enrolled unless they specifically opt-out, is there a higher than 95 percent participation rate (95.5 percent enrolled).
   To reverse this misguided policy, Senator Rockefeller has co-authored legislation that would postpone the implementation of the August 17 directive until April 2009. Additionally, the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act (S. 2819) will preserve access to Medicaid during the current recession by temporarily extending - through April 1, 2009 - the Medicaid moratoria on payments to public providers, graduate medical education, school-based services, and rehabilitative services that Congress has already enacted. 
    The legislation will also delay - through April 1, 2009 - implementation of the following additional Medicaid regulations, which are already in effect or scheduled to go into effect in the near future: targeted case management, allowable provider taxes, outpatient clinic and hospital services, and the Departmental Appeals Board rule. 
   The Economic Recovery in Health Care Act is pending before the Senate Finance Committee, where Rockefeller serves as a senior member.

MURKOWSKI PRAISES EXTENSION OF FMAP MATCHING RATE
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced that the state will continue to maintain its Medicaid Assistance matching rate. Signed into law by President Bush earlier this week, S.1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, included provisions that will allow Alaska to continue to receive a higher matching rate from the federal government. 
   The two year extension of Alaska's Federal Medicaid Assistance Program (FMAP) rate at 57.58 percent means that the state will receive approximately an additional $130 million in federal Medicaid funding for FY06 and FY07.
   ""The vital federal funding provided for FMAP in the Deficit Reduction Act will greatly assist the state in meeting the healthcare needs of Alaskans,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Our geography and limited transportation infrastructure translate into healthcare costs that are far higher than the rest of the country. With the signing of this act into law, the Alaskans most in need will continue to receive important healthcare services and supplies.""
   The language included in the deficit reduction bill, originally introduced by Murkowski as free standing legislation (S.159), requires the government to recognize Alaska's higher costs of medical care when dispensing federal Medicaid funds and provides a two year extension of the higher matching rate originally obtained by the Alaska Delegation in 1997.
   Calculated on the basis of per-capita income, the Medicaid formula does not take into consideration Alaska's high health care costs, which are caused principally by higher transportation costs. Alaska's health care costs are 70 percent higher than those in states in the Lower 48. Twenty percent of Alaskans are Medicaid eligible, which is significantly higher than the national average of 12 percent.

MURKOWSKI REINTRODUCES CAPE FOX LEGISLATION
  Senator Lisa Murkowski has reintroduced legislation to resolve certain conveyances and provide for alternative land selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act related to Cape Fox Corporation and Sealaska Corporation. The bill, S.203, enables the Cape Fox Corporation, representing the Native people of Saxman, to finalize its land entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).  
   Under ANCSA, Cape Fox Corporation is required to take conveyance to approximately 160 acres of unusable land in mountainous terrain. The legislation would relieve Cape Fox of its obligation to take this unusable land. The legislation would permit Cape Fox Corporation to receive 99 acres of land which adjoin their existing holdings instead of the 160 unusable acres. 
   ""Clearly, Cape Fox was placed on unequal economic footing relative to other village corporations in Southeast Alaska,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Despite its best efforts during the years since ANCSA was signed into law, Cape Fox has been unable to overcome the disadvantage the law built into its land selection opportunities by this inequitable treatment. It is my hope that this legislation will provide the remedies needed to help address this longstanding inequity."" 
   Cape Fox Corporation is an Alaskan Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, by the Native Village of Saxman, near Ketchikan. As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under Section 16. However, unlike other village corporations, Cape Fox was further restricted from selecting lands within 6 miles of the boundary of the home rule city of Ketchikan. All other ANCSA corporations were restricted from selecting within 2 miles of such a home rule of city. 
   The 6-mile restriction went beyond protecting Ketchikan's watershed and damaged Cape Fox by preventing the corporation from selecting valuable timber lands, industrial sites, and other commercial property, not only in its core township, but in surrounding lands far removed from Ketchikan and its watershed. As a result of the 6-mile restriction, only the mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core township, which is nonproductive and of no economic value, was available for selection by the corporation. Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation affected by this restriction.

MURKOWSKI, STEVENS REINTRODUCE MEASURE TO PROTECT GROUNDWATER, AID FLOOD FORECASTS, PROVIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH
  Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens recently reintroduced legislation requiring the federal government to fund a comprehensive study of water resources in Alaska, including an effort to map aquifers in populated Southcentral Alaska that increasingly supplies well water for tens of thousands of Alaskans.  
   Murkowski, in her past role as chairman of the Senate Water and Power Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, originally introduced the Alaska Water Resources Act of 2005 with her Alaska colleague Senator Ted Stevens. While the bill passed the Senate, time ran out in the 109th Congress before it was acted upon in the House. 
   Specifically, the legislation: ? Authorizes the U.S. Geological Survey to determine whether more stream gaging stations are necessary to aid in flood forecasting and to provide dependable water flows to help fight forest fires. The provision would focus on the threat of flooding to roads and infrastructure and also provide data to determine the availability of water to aid natural resource extraction. ? Requires the U.S. Commissioner of Reclamation to study and map aquifers in urbanizing areas that are dependent on groundwater: The City of Fairbanks, the Fairbanks Northstar Borough, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Municipality of Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula. ? Requires the Bureau of Reclamation to study whether any new technologies in water purification/delivery, including new desalination systems, might be useful to coastal and island communities to improve potable water supplies. 
   ""The importance of water resource data collection to a State that has a resource-based economy cannot be overstated,"" said Senator Murkowski. ""Economic development is predicated on access to an adequate water supply, and in my State there is inadequate hydrologic data upon which to secure both economic development and the health and welfare of Alaskan citizens."" 
   ""This bill will help communities plan for their future drinking water needs, which is a necessity as Alaska's population continues to grow,"" said Senator Stevens. ""Provisions in the legislation also allow the State to better design water systems and transportation infrastructure, while addressing the shortcomings of rural Alaska's water-sanitation systems. These improvements are critical to the development of our State's economy and will help ensure the health and safety of all Alaskans."" Murkowski, who noted that Alaska is estimated to hold one-third of all the fresh water in the nation, said the federal water study, already conducted for most of the rest of the nation, should be especially helpful to natural resource industries in the state in planning for the future. 
   She noted that resource developers, from oil production on Alaska's North Slope that needs water to build ice roads to potential mineral projects throughout the state, often have little baseline hydrology and water quality data available when they are required to meet environmental and regulatory permitting requirements. She said additional scientific information on water supplies will clearly benefit the state's residents, the economy, and the environment. 
   Under the bill the agencies will have two years to complete the required studies.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today joined with the members of the congressional delegation she recently hosted in ANWR to discuss what the group saw on their trip to Alaska's coastal plain.  
   ""A week ago, I said I was looking forward to leading the delegation to show them how we in Alaska do exploration and production in a first class and first rate way - and that's what they saw,"" Sen. Murkowski said. ""[The members of the delegation] walked away very impressed with the technology that's been developed over the last thirty years."" 
   Murkowski said that the delegation was able to compare the size of the footprint created by the thirty-year old production facilities at Prudhoe Bay and the new facilities at the Alpine oil fields. The group examined the ice roads that connect drilling facilities during the long winter on the coastal plain and visited with the residents of Kaktovik - the only village in ANWR to hear local concerns over possible production. 
   At today's press conference with Sen. Pete Domenici (NM), Sen. John Thune (SD), Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, Murkowski also noted that contrary to the claims of Sen. Tom Harkin (IA), who did not go on the trip to Alaska, the delegation did, in fact, walk on the 1002 area of the coastal plain - the only area of ANWR proposed for oil and gas leasing. 
   Senators Domenici and Thune commented that a first hand account of production in Alaska gave each of them renewed confidence that the time to open ANWR is now and that production can proceed with minimal impact to the environment. ""...In spite of the fact that I had learned a lot about ANWR, I learned a lot more by actually being on the ground and having the issues explained on site. I'm led to the conclusion that if you look around the United States and other places oil might be developed...the most environmentally clean place to drill and produce oil is ANWR,"" Domenici said. ""In the end it will be the cleanest location for exploration and development that we will ever see."" 
   ""What we are talking about on the North Slope of Alaska, after seeing it first hand, is responsible development...reflective of the values and the cultures and the tradition of the people who live there,"" Sen. Thune said.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed final passage on Saturday of legislation that she co-sponsored with Sen. Jim Talent, R-Mo., and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-MD, that will allow military personnel and their families to receive donated frequent flyer/travelers miles to cover military-connected travel.  
   The three on June 3 added the provision to the Defense Authorization bill for FY '05. On Saturday the conference report on the bill (H.R. 4200) passed both houses of Congress, sending the measure to the President for signature. The measure allows Americans to donate their miles to our men and women in uniform and their families. 
   ""The amendment will justly allow the families of wounded service personnel to visit their loved ones in a military hospital at no personal expense for airfare. It also will permit soldiers who must return home from overseas to do so at no cost by utilizing the air miles donated by Americans. This program allows Americans to show in a tangible way their support for our troops and it will help members of the military avoid the very real financial hardship caused when they need to purchase commercial airfares on short notice. It is the least we can do for our troops who are protecting us overseas,"" said Sen. Murkowski. 
   ""I applaud Sen. Murkowski for her leadership on this legislation. She worked hard on behalf of her constituents, and all of the men and women serving in our country, for this legislation. She recognizes the unique financial hardship that service members from Alaska could face when they return home from overseas while on emergency leave,"" said Sen. Talent. 
   The legislation makes Operation Hero Miles a permanent Department of Defense (DOD) program, giving DOD the authority to accept the donation of frequent traveler miles, credits and tickets by the general public in order to give free, last-minute plane tickets to servicemen and women on leave to handle an urgent family situation, convalescent leave or other unexpected emergencies. 
   The legislation also gives DOD the authority to give free plane tickets to family members of wounded troops traveling to visit their injured loved ones at military hospitals around the world. Under special circumstances, the DOD is also authorized to allow a non-family member, such as clergy or a close mentor, use of the donated miles to reunite with a wounded or ill service member. 
   The Department is to designate a single office to administer the Operation Hero Miles program, to establish rules and procedures for eligibility and disbursement of miles and to promote participation in the program and donation of miles by airlines, organizations and the public.

MURKOWSKI WINS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR AWARDING CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS TO ALASKA'S NATIVE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski has gained bipartisan backing in an effort to provide long overdue recognition to two leaders of Alaska's Native civil rights movement - Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich and her husband Roy Peratrovich - Murkowski last month proposing to posthumously grant a Congressional gold medal to honor their contributions to the nation's civil rights effort. Sen. Murkowski this weekend gained the backing of Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, for her legislation to authorize the President to have the Mint design and strike a gold medal in honor of the Southeast civil rights leaders. Murkowski who was joined originally in proposing the medal by Alaska senior Sen. Ted Stevens, said the Mint by the law would also be authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the medal to honor their accomplishments on behalf of all Alaskans.  
   Murkowski said she hoped the bipartisan support will help speed passage of the legislation, possibly later this fall. Murkowski when she introduced the measure Sept. 22 noted the accomplishments of the Peratrovich family who after the invasion of Pearl Harbor in 1941 publicly called on Alaska's Territorial Governor to end the rampant discrimination against Natives that prevented Natives from equal treatment in hotel accommodations, housing, dining and other activities. In 1943 they formally proposed the territories' first anti-discrimination measure - it failed to pass. In 1945 they tried again, the measure passing the Territory's House. ""One by one (Territory) senators took to the floor to argue against the mixing of the races. One church leader testified it would take 30 to 100 years before Alaska Natives would reach the equality of the 'white' man. ""Then Elizabeth Peratrovich rose from the visitor's gallery and said she would like to be heard. In a quite, dignified and steady voice she said, 'I would not have expected that I, who am barely out of savagery, would have to remind gentlemen with five thousand years of recorded history behind them of our Bill of Rights.' ""When she finished, there was a wild burst of applause from the gallery and the Senate floor alike. The territorial Senate passed the bill by a vote of 11 to 5 and on Feb. 8, 1945 Alaska had an anti-discrimination law that provided that all citizens of the territory of Alaska are entitled to full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations - the bill passing 18 years before Dr. Martin Luther King spoke of his dream of civil rights for all on the steps of the Washington Monument and nearly 20 years before the U.S. Congress passed sweeping civil rights laws for the whole of American society,"" said Senator Murkowski. Murkowski said she is proposing the congressional gold medal to give long overdue recognition to the efforts of the Peratrovich family.

2006 Washington  D C    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today gave the following address about the deplorable leadership and oppression exercised by Burma s dictatorship following the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi   Mr  President  every so often a clarifying moment in international affairs reminds us of the stakes involved in a particular conflict  and of our moral obligation to stand with those who risk their lives for the principles of freedom  The violent crackdown against Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters over the weekend underscores the brutal and unreconstructed character of Burma s dictatorship  The assault should remind democrats everywhere that we must actively support her struggle to deliver the human rights and freedom of a people long denied them by an oppressive military regime   The arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi following a coordinated  armed attack against her and her supporters is a reminder to the world that Burma s military junta has neither legitimacy nor limits on its power to crush peaceful dissent  The junta insists it stepped in to restore order following armed clashes between members of Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy and unnamed opponents  In fact  the regime s forces had been harassing Suu Kyi and the NLD for months  The junta s Union Solidarity Development Association orchestrated and staged last weekend s attack  killing at least 70 of her supporters and injuring Suu Kyi herself  perhaps seriously  Credible reports suggest that the regime s thugs targeted Suu Kyi personally  She is now being held incommunicado by Burmese military intelligence  her party offices have been closed  many of its activists are missing  and universities have been shut down  After having spent most of the last 14 years under house arrest  Ms  Suu Kyi is  one again  a political prisoner   Aung San Suu Kyi is one of the world s most courageous champions of freedom  I join advocates of a free Burma everywhere in expressing outrage at her unwarranted detention and call for her immediate  unconditional release  and the freedom to travel and speak throughout her country   Closing party offices  shuttering universities  and detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and senior members of her party in the name of protecting her demonstrate how estranged the junta is from its own people  and how potent are Suu Kyi s appeals for democratic change in a nation that resoundingly endorsed her in democratic elections 13 years ago  The junta s decision to release her from house arrest a year ago  and to permit her to speak and travel within tightly circumscribed limits  appeared to reflect the generals  calculation that her popular appeal had diminished  and that perhaps her fighting spirit had flagged  They could not have been more wrong   Aung San Suu Kyi remains the legitimately elected and overwhelmingly popular leader of her country  Even though she was under house arrest in 1990  her party captured 82 percent of the vote  shocking the generals  Neither the huge majority of the Burmese people who voted for the NLD nor the international community have forgotten how Burma s junta rejected the election results  nor how the regime s forces massacred its own people at a democratic rally two years earlier  We have not forgotten the many political prisoners who remain in Burma s jails  or the repression Burma s people have endured for decades  The assault on Burma s free political future at the hands of the regime last weekend has reminded us of what we already knew  the junta cannot oversee the reform and opening of Burma  for it remains the biggest obstacle to the freedom and prosperity of the Burmese people  Burma cannot change as long as the junta rules  without restraint or remorse   Despite these obvious truths  of which we have been reminded again this week  some countries have chosen to pursue policies of political and commercial engagement with the government in Rangoon on the grounds that working with and through the junta would have a more significant liberalizing effect than isolating and sanctioning it  ASEAN admitted Burma in 1997  Beijing has enjoyed warm relations with Rangoon  and most countries trade with it  only the United States and Europe impose mild sanctions against the regime  Proponents of engagement pointed to the nascent dialogue between Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime  and her release from house arrest last May  as indicators that perhaps external influence was having some beneficial effect on the dictatorship  But advocates of engagement have little to show for it following last weekend s assault on the democrats   Burma s junta must understand quite clearly that it will not enjoy business as usual following its brutal attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD  It is time for the international community to acknowledge that the status quo serves nobody s interests except those of the regime  Burma s people suffer  its neighbors are embarrassed  companies cannot do the kind of business they would with a free and developing Burma  the drug lords flourish in a vacuum of governance  and the situation inside the country grows more unstable as the regime s misrule increasingly radicalizes and impoverishes its people   No country or leader motivated by the welfare of the Burmese people  a desire for regional stability and prosperity  or concern for Burma s place among nations can maintain that rule by the junta serves these interests  I find it hard to believe that any democratic government would stand by the junta as it takes Burma on a forced march back in time  Yet this morning  when asked about the weekend s assault  the Japanese Foreign Minister denied that the situation in Burma was getting worse  said progress is being made toward democratization  and announced that Japan has no intention of changing its policy on Burma  Music to the junta s ears  perhaps  but I believe friends of the Burmese people must take a radically different  and principled  approach to a problem that kind words will only exacerbate   The world cannot stand by as the ruination of this country continues any farther  Free Burma s leaders  and her people  will remember which nations stood with them in their struggle against oppression  and which nations seemed to side with their oppressors   American and international policy towards Burma should reflect our conviction that oppression and impunity must come to an end  and that the regime must move towards a negotiated settlement with Aung San Suu Kyi that grants her a leading and irreversible political role culminating in free and fair national elections  If it does not  the regime will not be able to manage the transition  when it does come  for it will come without its consent   I believe the United States should immediately expand the visa ban against Burmese officials to include all members of the Union Solidarity Development Association  which organized the attack against Aung San Suu Kyi s delegation last weekend  The Administration should also immediately issue an executive order freezing the U S  assets of Burmese leaders  U N  special envoy Razali Ismail should not travel to Burma as planned this week unless he has assurances from the regime that he will be able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi   Congress should promptly consider legislation banning Burmese imports into the United States  and the Administration should encourage the European Union to back up its commitment to human rights in Burma with concrete steps in this direction  The U S  and the E U  together account for over 50 percent of Burma s exports and therefore enjoy considerable leverage against the regime  The United States alone absorbs between 20 and 25 percent of Burma s exports  Consideration of a U S  import ban should help focus attention in Rangoon on the consequences of flagrantly violating the human rights of the Burmese people and their chosen leaders  In coordination with a new U S  initiative  an E U  move in the direction of punitive trade sanctions would make the regime s continuing repression difficult if not impossible to sustain   The junta s latest actions are a desperate attempt by a decaying regime to stall freedom s inevitable progress  in Burma and across Asia  They will fail as surely as Aung San Suu Kyi s campaign for a free Burma will one day succeed                                                   June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by

  Last week the U.S. Senate set aside immigration reform legislation, hoping to return to the subject in a few weeks. Senate Democrats abused the rules by refusing to allow consideration of any amendments, and even Republicans who supported the legislation agreed it was wrong to vote on the bill until amendments could be dealt with.  
   I oppose the legislation, among other reasons, because it would provide an automatic pathway to citizenship for the illegal immigrants already here as well as all ""temporary"" workers allowed to come to the U.S. in the future. That is unwise, unfair, and unnecessary: unwise because jobs that exist today in an expanding economy will not necessarily be there in the next economic downturn; unfair to the millions of would-be legal immigrants waiting patiently in line (in their countries) to come here; and unnecessary because most come here illegally to work, earn money, and return to their home country--not because they want to become citizens. 
   We must make sure that the resources and will to enforce any new immigration reform exists. The first amendment I filed would have disallowed criminals or ""absconders"" from receiving the benefits of any new legislation--neither citizenship nor legal permanent residence should be allowed for those who have already been convicted of serious crimes or deliberately violated a removal order of an immigration judge; yet the Democratic Leader has steadfastly refused to allow a vote on the amendment. 
   Legislation I introduced last year would provide the resources to secure the border and enforce the law in the interior, as well as ensure only legal residents (and citizens) can be employed. Under my proposal, the temporary worker program would grant only temporarymillion over the next 10 years. 
   No one has suggested rounding up and deporting illegal immigrants. Nor has anyone in the Senate advocated prosecution of anyone who provides humanitarian assistance to immigrants. There are other myths abound. That's unfortunate, for we ought to have a civil and comprehensive discussion of this critically important issue. 
   I hope when the Senate completes other business, it can get back to immigration reform. The longer we wait to solve the problem the harder it will be to solve. But it's got to be done right; and if we are not absolutely serious about enforcing the new law, it would be better not to pass it. The next amnesty would attract many millions of illegal immigrants from all over the world. That would be unacceptable.

  Senate Democrats and other opponents of President Bush's nomination of Alberto Gonzales for U.S. Attorney General have alleged, in harshly personal terms, that Gonzales somehow undercut the Geneva Conventions by issuing a legal opinion that, even though all combat detainees must be treated humanely, the privileges and immunities granted to uniformed soldiers held as prisoners of war do not extend to terrorists and other unlawful combatants captured by US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   What this criticism ignores is that a long list of unbiased analysts have reached the same conclusion, including: three different federal courts; the 9/11 Commission; an independent review panel led by former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger; and a group of former State Department legal advisers, judge advocates general, military commanders and liberal international law scholars who filed a brief in a recent U.S. Supreme Court case.  
   The Geneva Conventions, ratified by the U.S. Senate, specifically exclude extending P.O.W. protections to unlawful combatants - i.e., to those who violate the laws of war, do not wear uniforms, and do not operate under a responsible command structure. Does any reasonable person doubt that Al Qaeda fits this definition? 
   Andrew C. McCarthy, who led the 1995 terrorism prosecution against Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, eloquently states the obvious in noting that Al Qaeda does not meet the test of lawful combatant: 
   ""Since the early 1990s, al Qaeda has, at the very least ... urged the murder of all Americans - civilians and military alike - wherever on the globe they may be found; conducted simultaneous sneak attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, resulting in the mass murder of over 240 civilians (the vast majority of them Muslims and non-Americans); murdered 3,000 Americans in hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon; and spearheaded guerrilla wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   In addition to killing civilians in sneak attacks - commonly, detonating bombs within nondescript cars parked or driven in broad daylight in densely populated areas - they also secrete themselves among their once and future victims. They wear no distinguishing insignia to segregate themselves as a militia. They use mosques and schools and hospitals to plan and store weaponry. They feign surrender and then open fire on unsuspecting coalition forces attempting the civilized act of detaining, rather than shooting, them. As for treatment of their own detainees, their practice ranges from execution-style homicide to beastly beheading - usually captured on film and circulated on the Internet.""
   In applying these realities to the clear terms of the Geneva Conventions, Mr. Gonzales was simply doing his job. 
   It's worth considering the extensive privileges that the Geneva Conventions afford honorable combatants. They include athletic uniforms, scientific instruments, kitchenettes and ""a monthly pay allowance in Swiss francs,"" as Lee A. Casey and David Rivkin Jr. have noted in the National Review. Moreover, questioners are not even allowed to entice such detainees to cooperate by offering creature comforts or other preferential treatment (which is, of course, standard operating procedure in police stations across the United States). 
   Worse, as my colleague Sen. John Cornyn of Texas pointed out at Gonzales' confirmation hearing last week: ""Because the convention prohibits the holding of detainees in isolation, Al Qaeda fighters would be able to coordinate with each other. And POW status even confers broad combat immunity against criminal prosecution before civilian and military tribunals alike. Surely no member of this committee actually believes that an Al Qaeda terrorist deserves to be treated better than an American citizen accused of a crime!"" 
   Mr. Gonzales has served well as White House counsel, and he clearly is competent to serve as Attorney General of the United States. He shouldn't be attacked for rendering correct legal advice to the President.

   ""Many agreed that there needed to be a different approach in Iraq. And now that the President has outlined a change in strategy, we should give his proposals an opportunity to work.

  Experts agree that there is much more required for quality education than money. Nonetheless, the federal government is making a major investment to support state efforts to improve education. Since 1995, funding for the U.S. Department of Education has increased by nearly 150 percent, from $23 billion in 1996 to $57 billion in 2006. 
   In the past five years alone, there have been dramatic increases in education funding: a 40.1 percent ($6.97 billion) increase in No Child Left Behind Act funding; a 45.4 percent ($3.98 billion) increase for Title I grants for economically disadvantaged students; a 67 percent ($4.25 billion) increase for special education grants to states; a 400 percent increase for reading from $286 million in 2001 to $1.1 billion in 2005 (a 300 percent increase); and a 34 percent ($14.35 billion) increase in total federal education funding.  
   Of course, these monies must be aimed at achieving specific goals. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed to make sure that these federal funds are being dedicated to giving every child a quality education. Federally required testing will not only track averages, but also each child's progress. The object is to ensure that no children are left behind. 
   Responding to concerns that the additional resources were not being directed to school districts with growing populations of students, like those in Arizona, I worked with Senators from other rapidly growing states to include in the Act a provision directing the government to allot more Title I funds to high growth states. 
   Since the passage of No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, there have been clear results here in Arizona. This year, up to 98 percent of students with sufficient credits will pass the AIMS test and graduate from high school. This means that almost every Arizona student who strove to graduate this year was actually able to don the cap and gown and receive a diploma. It also means that our state will benefit from a new generation of young adults with the self-respect and values that come with successfully graduating. Many of these students will go on to our state's outstanding universities and become Arizona's next generation of leaders. 
   Things have also improved at the primary and elementary levels. In 2000, only 16 percent of fourth graders got a ""proficient"" score in math. By 2005, this number had almost doubled to 28 percent. Similarly, in 2000, only 20 percent of Arizona's eighth graders qualified as proficient in math. By 2005, this number had gradually climbed to 26. These numbers are still nowhere near respectable, but the direction they're going in is encouraging. 
   The trend shows that the accountability measures incorporated into No Child Left Behind are beginning to help Arizona's children. 
   The federal government has assisted college students for years. Since 1995, the amount a college student may borrow has been raised to historic levels, and the number of Pell Grants awarded to students has increased dramatically. Pell Grants will grow by $240 million and the number of recipients will increase by 59,000 to 5.3 million students. Funding for Pell Grants rose from $8.8 billion in 2001 to $13 billion in 2006. In 2006, the Department of Education expects to distribute over $77 billion in grants, loans, and other aid to over 10 million students. Recent legislation has also removed origination fees and costs from lenders, passing on the savings to students. And for those now entering school, keep in mind that the costs of student loans, including the interest accrued, are deferred until after graduation, and represent an investment in your future. 
   High quality public education is the key to America's success. It provides opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to compete with and overtake their more privileged peers. When the education system works properly, every child is able, through hard work and determination, to make his or her dreams of success become reality.

  Sen. Jon Kyl, along with Sen. John McCain, today re-introduced legislation that calls for a study to determine the feasibility and desirability of designating the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic or Historic Trail. An identical bill is slated to be introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Jim Kolbe, on behalf of the entire Arizona House delegation.  
   ""The Arizona Trail is highly deserving of consideration for national designation,"" Kyl said. A roller coaster ride through the wide range of ecological diversity in the state, the Trail corridor begins at the Coronado National Memorial on the U.S. Mexico Border, and winds some 800 miles, ending on the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip District on the Utah Border. ""As it connects these two points, the trail invites exploration of the state's most renowned mountains, canyons, deserts and forests, including the Grand Canyon and the Sonora Desert,"" Kyl said. ""This trail is unique in that it was developed to maximize the incorporation of already existing public trails into one continuous trail, to showcase some of the most spectacular scenery in the West."" 
   In 1968, Congress established the National Trails System to promote the preservation of historical resources and outdoor areas. National scenic and national historic trails may be designated only by an act of Congress. The first step toward national trail designation is the feasibility study process. 
   The Arizona Trail is maintained by a partnership of over 16 federal, state and local agencies, as well as numerous community and business organizations and countless volunteers. ""Authorizing this study and ultimately designating the Arizona Trail as a national trail will help streamline its management, boost tourism and recreation, and preserve a magnificent natural, cultural, historical experience of the American West,"" Kyl said. 
   The Arizona Trail Feasibility Study Act was first introduced a year ago, in the last session of Congress.

  You can't spend more than you make - just ask any American family on a budget.
   Families have to set priorities when spending the money they earn. If a family increases spending in one area of the budget, it limits spending in another, or risks going into debt. And, in order to pay off a debt, a family would normally cut back its spending to pay off the money it owes. These are simply common-sense, responsible principles. 
   Shouldn't the government then follow these principles when spending taxpayer dollars? Unfortunately, if the recently unveiled Democratic budget is any indication, the federal government has no plans to play by these rules.
   The proposed Democratic budget will spend billions of taxpayer dollars, even increasing spending at a time when the economy is slowing and the government must be ever-more careful with each dollar. Spending billions more in taxpayer money is the wrong medicine for an economy that is getting sick.
   At a time when Americans are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and pay for the rising costs of groceries and gasoline, 43 million American families will owe an additional $2,300 in taxes under the Democratic proposal. Eighteen million seniors will owe $2,200 more, and 27 million small businesses - the core of our job market and engine that drives our economy - will each be hit with an additional $4,100 on their tax bill, potentially forcing lay-offs and decreasing the number of available jobs on the market.
   The proposed Democratic budget increases federal spending by $22 billion over the President's request for 2009, and $211 billion over the next five years. The overall level of spending in this budget is actually understated because the Democrats raid the Social Security trust fund and spend $775 billion that would otherwise be used to pay for future retirement benefits.
   Instead of reducing the debt as promised, congressional Democrats intend to allow the national debt to climb by $2 trillion by 2013! That's more than $6,000 in extra debt for every American. Without any way of paying for these spending increases, Democrats are left with their old standby: raising taxes. By failing to extend the current tax rates, the Democratic budget would raise taxes by $1.2 trillion on 116 million Americans.
   The budget does, however, make room for $35 billion of so-called, ""economic stimulus,"" so that Congress can spend more on roads, home heating subsidies, and unemployment insurance. I believe these resources would be better utilized to actually help the economy by giving taxpayers more certainty about their taxes this year. Congress should extend expiring tax provisions such as the higher education deduction and extend current income tax rates. If one wants to help the economy, don't raise taxes.
   Last year, congressional Democrats crafted their first budget after a decade of minority status. That budget revealed the Democrats fiscal plan for the country: tax hikes and a spending free-for-all. This year, their proposed budget is more of the same. I'm going to fight the spending increases and tax hikes that threaten to take more money from hardworking American families and support more sensible alternatives.

KYL DELIVERES REMARKS AT MISSILE DEFENSE CONFERENCE
  U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) today delivered remarks on missile defense priorities at the American Foreign Policy Council's ""Missile Defense and American Security"" conference. The following are excerpts: 
   ""Will we build upon the investments and progress of the past 25 years with the energy, sense of purpose and resources necessary to counter the threats we face, or will we hold back our nascent missile defense capability, preventing it from being all it can be?""
   ""You know the right answer - let us mobilize to win the fight.""
   ""At the conclusion of President Reagan's speech 25 years ago he asked a simple question: 'isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war?'""
   ""Given the unreliability of treaties to accomplish the goal, Reagan's motto of 'peace through strength' is the answer to his question.""
   ""And that means the best possible missile defense system we can deploy.""
   ""The leading Democrat [candidate for President] has gone from statements such as 'I don't agree with a missile defense system' to promising that he would save billions in wasteful defense spending by cutting missile defense system research by as much as $10 billion.""
   ""This is the defense posture of the individual the polls say may be the next Commander-in-Chief.""
   ""And he's proposing cutting $10 billion out of missile defense, the budget for which is not even $10 billion this year!""
   ""This is not just ill informed speech making, it is very dangerous policy and it is dangerous for a candidate to speak this way when we know our adversaries listen very carefully to what we say.""

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Last year, a majority in Congress, working closely with President Bush, acted decisively to lower taxes for all taxpayers and small businesses to stimulate growth and help create jobs. May 28 will mark the one-year anniversary of enactment of this important law, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. 
   Now, others in Congress, including Senator John Kerry, have called for repealing some or all of this tax relief. Have the tax cuts hurt our economic recovery? Some Democrats would have us think so. Twelve months of economic data since the tax cuts were enacted, however, tell a different story. 
   Consider: Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 8.2 percent in the third quarter of 2003, 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, and 4.2 percent in the first quarter of 2004. This is the fastest three-quarter growth rate in nearly two decades. At this pace, our economy would double in size in 13 years. 
   According to the payroll survey, 288,000 new jobs were created in April, preceded by 337,000 in March. Over 1.1 million new jobs have been created over the last eight months. In June of 2003, when the tax cuts went into effect, the national unemployment rate was 6.3 percent. Less than a year later, it has dropped 11 percent to 5.6 percent, which is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Last week, new jobless claims fell to 315,000 - the lowest level since before the 2000 election. 
   Congress lowered the tax rate on dividends from 39.6 percent to 15 percent last year in order to make dividend-paying stocks more valuable, and to induce companies to improve corporate governance and raise dividend payouts to shareholders. The return on this tax cut has been greater than even its most ardent supporters predicted. One year later, the stock market has risen (on average) by 25 percent, and, according to Thomas Smith, the president of Prescott Associates, companies have increased dividend payments to shareholders by 40 percent, reversing a two-decade decline. Companies that began paying dividends following the tax cut include Best Buy, MGM, and Microsoft; other companies like Citigroup and Nike dramatically increased their dividends-per-share. 
   Business investment - the area that has hesitated most in joining the economic recovery - is hesitating no longer. It has increased by seven percent or more in each of the last four quarters, and manufacturing activity has increased for 11 consecutive months. The causes are many. The dividends and capital gains tax cuts (capital gains taxes were reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent) made it much more attractive for investors to risk their hard-earned money in the markets, giving companies a needed infusion of capital to expand their businesses. Also, reducing individual tax rates encouraged people to work harder and longer and also gave people a greater ability to make purchases. Add to that record low interest rates and a strong housing market, and individuals and families have rarely been on a more sound economic footing. 
   Every economist I know agrees that last year's tax cuts have been instrumental in putting Americans back on the path to growth and prosperity. So when politicians say when they need more of your money so they can spend it - for your own good, of course - beware. Raising taxes would not just hurt upper-income taxpayers, it would also jeopardize continued economic growth, to the detriment of all taxpayers. None of us should want that.

KYL PRAISES PASSAGE OF IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL CONFERENCE REPORT
  Sen. Jon Kyl today applauded the final passage by the Senate of an $82.04 billion FY 2005 Emergency Supplemental bill that includes funding and new tools for the global war on terrorism as well as significant provisions to improve border enforcement.  
   Three major provisions from the Material Support to Terrorism Prohibition Improvements Act, which Kyl introduced earlier this year and reviewed in hearings before his Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, are in the supplemental: 
   * Section 103(a) bars entry into the United States for representatives and members of terrorist groups and aliens who have received military-type training from groups they knew were terrorist in nature. 
   * Section 105(a)(1) expands the deportation of such aliens who may already be in the United States. 
   * Section 103(d) makes clear that terrorist-alien deportation and exclusion provisions apply to terrorist activity that the alien engaged in before the enactment of the supplemental.
  ""In addition to these new tools for fighting terrorism, the border provisions of the supplemental will help strengthen the rule of law and improve homeland security against terrorist infiltration,"" Kyl said. 
   Passed by the House on Thursday, the bill includes significant new funding Kyl supported, including $635 million for increased border security, which will allow the hiring of 500 new border patrol agents, 50 immigration and Customs inspectors, 168 enforcement agents and detention officers, as well as 1,950 detention beds that will help prevent the release, for lack of a place to keep them, of those who should be deported. 
   Also included, as part of the House-passed Real ID Act, is a provision that states require proof of lawful presence in the United States for their driver's licenses to be accepted as identification for federal purposes, and that temporary licenses issued to foreign visitors expire when the visitor's visa expires 
   ""Enforcing the law and controlling the border are among the most critical domestic challenges we face in the war against terrorism,"" Kyl said. ""This funding will provide much needed help to the border and in the interior, but we're still a long way from achieving the kind of security we need.""

CRITICAL PROTECTIONS INCLUDED   Washington  D C   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy spoke out against the nomination of Paul DeCamp as Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor and released a new GAO report finding millions of workers are currently lacking key workplace protections    Mr  DeCamp  an attorney who has represented Wal Mart  has a long and troubling record on workers rights  DeCamp has proposed overtime rollbacks for millions of workers  and has expressed his view that most claims for unpaid overtime are spurious   He now serves in a temporary position at the Department of Labor where he has been heavily involved in the Departments disastrous failure to protect workers from abuses of wage laws and overtime protections in the Gulf Coast region   Choosing Mr  DeCamp to enforce laws he doesnt believe in and protections he doesnt support seems to be a flagrant example of the fox guarding the henhouse   The safeguards of our nations wage and hour laws protect employees basic rights  Senator Kennedy said   We need strong leadership at the Wage and Hour division to make these rights a reality for all Americans      On DeCamps work related to the Gulf Coast Kennedy added    He has been deeply involved in the Departments abysmal failure to protect the rights of workers in the Gulf Coast   Senator Kennedy said  An alarming number of those men and women are not being paid at all for their work  or are not being paid the wages required by law  or are being forced to work overtime without overtime pay   Yet the Department of Labor is AWOL from the region  and has made it almost impossible for workers to file claims when their rights are violated      If confirmed  DeCamp would be responsible for enforcing critical worker protections such as minimum wage  overtime pay  and the child labor protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act   Senator Kennedy strongly believes that he is the wrong person for the job     Senator Kennedy also released a GAO report revealing a significant portion of the American workforce lacks critical workplace protections because they are classified as contingent workers with fewer rights   Currently  42 6 million workers are classified as contingent workers where they are less likely to have health insurance or pension benefits and are often not covered by key workplace protection laws    In response to the GAO report  Senator Kennedy said  I am deeply disturbed by the findings of this report  which reveal the Bush Administrations cavalier approach to protecting workers rights   The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is a serious problem that cheats workers out of hard earned pay and threatens their health and safety   The Department of Labor must do much more to educate workers about their rights  and it must undertake vigilant enforcement efforts to detect and remedy worker misclassification    A summary of the report follows Senator Kennedys statement    Below is his prepared statement     STATEMENT BY SENATOR EDWARD M  KENNEDY ON NOMINATION OF PAUL DeCAMP   AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY   Today we also have the opportunity to consider another important nomination  that of Paul DeCamp to be Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division at the Department of Labor   This vital position is charged with enforcing many of our most critical worker protections  including the minimum wage  overtime pay  the child labor protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act  the leave requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act  and the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act     The actions of the Wage and Hour Administrator affect the lives of every worker in America   He ensures that men and women who work overtime will be able to rely on overtime pay to make ends meet   He protects working teenagers from being forced to use dangerous equipment that could threaten their health or safety   He ensures that parents who need to care for sick children can meet their family needs and still return to their jobs   He defends vulnerable employees such as migrant workers and day laborers when they are exploited by unscrupulous employers     Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has shown a troubling lack of commitment to protecting workers rights in these areas   They have adopted regulations that could deny overtime rights from as many as 6 million workers   Theyve made sweetheart deals that let repeat offenders like Wal Mart off the hook for violating child labor laws year after year   Theyve refused to raise the minimum wage for hardworking people living below the poverty line   Theyve failed to protect the rights of the hard working men and women rebuilding the Gulf Coast   The nomination of Mr  DeCamp raises troubling questions   His record clearly demonstrates that he does not have the commitment to workers rights that is necessary to fulfill the goals of these important laws   His extensive record of publications shows that he does not support the goals of the statutes he will be responsible for enforcing   Hes advocated changes in current law to drastically reduce the number of employees entitled to overtime pay  and hes suggested that those who work overtime but are denied overtime pay by their employers do not deserve the remedies these laws provide   His record in private practice is equally disturbing   He has a long history of representing employers with strong anti labor agendas   His ties to Wal Mart  one of the industrys most notorious  offending employers  calls into question whether he can carry out his responsibilities with the perspective necessary to protect the rights of workers       Since joining the Department of Labor in an advisory capacity last year  he has been deeply involved in the Departments abysmal failure to protect the rights of workers in the Gulf Coast   An alarming number of those men and women are not being paid at all for their work  or are not being paid the wages required by law  or are being forced to work overtime without overtime pay   Yet the Department of Labor is AWOL from the region  and has made it almost impossible for workers to file claims when their rights are violated      Choosing Mr  DeCamp to enforce laws he doesnt believe in and protections he doesnt support seems to be a flagrant example of the fox guarding the henhouse   The safeguards of our nations wage and hour laws protect employees basic rights   Hardworking men and women have a right to a fair days pay for a fair days work   They have a right to overtime pay if the law provides it  They have a right to keep their jobs if they become ill or have to care for a sick family member   We need strong leadership at the Wage and Hour Division to make these rights a reality for all Americans       Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for this hearing and I look forward to the testimony of our nominees   SENATOR KENNEDY RELEASES NEW GAO REPORT   CONTINGENT WORKERS LOSE CRITICAL WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS   A Government Accountability Office report released today by Senator Edward M  Kennedy reveals that a significant portion of the American workforce lacks critical workplace protections because they are classified as contingent workers and do not receive the same rights as other employees     The report  entitled Employment Arrangements   Improved Outreach Could Help Ensure Proper Worker Classification  finds that about 42 6 million U S  workers are currently employed in contingent work arrangements  where they do not receive the benefits of the traditional employment relationship   These workers are far less likely to have health insurance or pension benefits  and they are often not covered by key workplace protection laws like antidiscrimination laws  overtime and minimum wage laws  or workplace health and safety laws       Only 13 percent of contingent workers receive healthcare through their workplace  compared to 73 percent of regular full time workers      Only 38 percent of contingent workers receive pensions  compared to 76 percent of other full time workers     The report further finds that too many employers are intentionally misclassifying their workers as independent contractors  As a result of such misclassification  an employee who works 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year for the same employer  follows that employers instructions  and receives their paycheck from that employer can be denied basic benefits and basic rights  like the right to family and medical leave or the right to be free from discrimination  because their employer is engaging in legal trickery        A class action lawsuit is currently pending against Wal Mart Stores alleging that the retail giant misclassified thousands of janitorial workers as independent contractors and refused to pay them minimum wages or overtime pay to which they were lawfully entitled   Wal Mart is alleging that these workers are independent contractors despite the fact that the store had the power to hire and fire them  controlled their wages  hours and working conditions  and directed them in the day to day tasks of their work   Such misclassification cheats these workers out of protections they lawfully deserve and have rightfully earned  while cheating the government out of needed tax revenues       According to the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service  15 percent of employers have misclassified employees as independent contractors      These misclassifications result in a loss to the federal government of about  2 7 billion per year in tax revenue  Unfortunately the Department of Labors efforts to detect and prevent these abuses are seriously deficient  and workers are left without the assistance they need to protect their rights   The Department is not undertaking any effort to detect employee misclassification   And while the Department relies on workers to report violations of the law  it is not even attempting to educate workers about their rights         The Departments standard poster informing workers about their rights in the workplace does not contain any information on employee misclassification  or inform employees how to register a complaint that they have been misclassified        While the Departments procedures require officials to share information with other federal and state agencies when they uncover a misclassification problem that may violate other laws  such as tax laws or unemployment insurance laws  the GAO found that the Department does not consistently follow this directive   In response to the GAO report  Senator Kennedy said  I am deeply disturbed by the findings of this report  which reveal the Bush Administrations cavalier approach to protecting workers rights   The misclassification of employees as independent contractors is a serious problem that cheats workers out of hard earned pay and

Safeguard Federal Student Loan Program   Education Department Must Increase Oversight of Student LendersWASHINGTON  D C   The U S  Department of Education has failed to safeguard the nations federal student loan programs and should immediately increase its oversight of lenders and schools and fully enforce the law  government investigators concluded in a new report released today by leading Democratic lawmakers  Todays report comes after months of congressional and state investigations have uncovered unethical financial relationships among lenders  school financial aid officers  and public officials responsible for overseeing the federal student loan program in the Departments Office of Federal Student Aid  Under current law  lenders participating in the federal loan program are prohibited from using inducements or gifts to curry favor with colleges or universities  The report  which was prepared by the Government Accountability Office at the request of Reps  George Miller  D CA  and Dale E  Kildee  D MI   and Senators Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Dick Durbin  D IL   found that the Department does not have a sufficient oversight program in place to identify and address questionable lender behavior  such as inducements  In addition  the report found that despite repeated requests from lenders for the Department to provide direction on inducements  the Department had not updated its inducement guidelines in nearly 20 years and  in some cases  did not respond to lenders inquiries at all  In 2003  the Departments Inspector General also urged the Department to issue a Dear Colleague letter to lenders and schools on its regulations regarding inducements and gifts  The report also determined that the Department had a poor system for dealing with complaints of improper lender behavior  For example  out of 26 documented complaints received by the Department between 2001 and 2006  only two complaints prompted action by the Department  and 14 complaints were left unresolved  In addition  the report found that the Department attempted to use its sanctioning authority against lenders accused of improper inducements only twice over the past twenty years This report again underscores that the Department of Education completely defaulted on its responsibilities to protect the nations student loan programs  said Miller  the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee  There is simply no excuse for this administration ignoring repeated warnings about potential lender abuses  both from independent agencies and even from lenders themselves  Earlier this year I called on the Secretary to take emergency actions to hold lenders and schools accountable and enforce the law  Today I again urge her to start doing the job she was entrusted with by immediately implementing this reports recommendations Students and families should be deeply concerned that the Department of Education failed to enforce the laws designed to protect them from unscrupulous lender tactics for so long  said Kennedy  the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  The higher education bill passed unanimously by the Senate last week provides even more protections for borrowers  but theyll only be effective with proper follow through by the Department  I hope Secretary Spellings will do everything in her power to build on her recent efforts to increase enforcement of the current laws against improper lender inducements  and carefully consider the recommendations in this report  For those of us in the Congress who have been working to protect students from exploitation  todays GAO report has confirmed our fears  said Durbin  Lenders continue to take advantage of students entering college and the Department of Education is not doing enough to prevent it  Parents and students have placed their trust in a Department that is not living up to its responsibility  If Secretary Spellings ignores this grim report  more and more students will be saddled with avoidable debt for years to come  The Departments failure to conduct even the most basic oversight is a great disservice to hard working students and their families  said Kildee  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood  Elementary  and Secondary Education  I hope that the Secretary finally will take this opportunity to rectify the results of this prior inaction In May  U S  Education Secretary Margaret Spellings appeared before the House Education and Labor Committee to testify about the Departments role in conducting oversight of the federal student loan programs and the Reading First program  another education program that has been marred by conflicts of interest  In April  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo http   www house gov apps list speech edlabor_dem rel042507 html http   www house gov apps list speech edlabor_dem rel042507 html told the Committee that the Bush administration had been asleep at the switch when it came to providing oversight over the student loan programs  Over the past several months  Miller and Kennedy have been conducting investigations into the student loan industry  Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation that would clean up the relationships between lenders and schools  In February  Miller and Kennedy introduced the bipartisan Student Loan Sunshine Act  which the House overwhelmingly http   www house gov apps list speech edlabor_dem rel050907a html http   www house gov apps list speech edlabor_dem rel050907a html passed in May  Key provisions of the bill were incorporated into the Senates reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  the Higher Education Amendments of 2007  To see a PDF copy of the GAO report  click here http   edlabor house gov

FRIST COMMENTS ON KAISER SURVEY
  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., today made the following statement regarding the release of the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health Survey:
   ""Surveys of opinions about the new Medicare law, including today's Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School of Public Health Survey, provide interesting figures that may become part of a political debate. But what is important is policy, not politics. The fact is that seniors enrolled in the new Medicare prescription drug discount card are getting real relief from the high cost of prescription drugs. And more help is on the way. 
   ""The programs enacted by the new law are already helping millions of seniors and Americans with disabilities, and these benefits will dramatically improve when the full benefit is implemented in 2006.
   ""Public officials who mislead seniors about their choices and benefits are part of the problem contributing to the unfortunate reality, confirmed in today's survey, that many seniors are confused about the new Medicare law and the benefits available to them, or that they simply don't know enough about its benefits. Seniors deserve to know the facts. Today's survey shows that we need to work together to provide them the information they need to take advantage of the real savings available under this landmark Medicare prescription drug benefit.""
   Facts about the Prescription Drug Program: 
   * 4 million Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in the new Medicare-endorsed prescription drug card program and 100,000 more are enrolling each week. 
   * Card holders average 17-24 percent savings on their prescription drugs (with some seniors saving as much as 89 percent) according to a July 28 Kaiser Family Foundation report. 
   * 7 million seniors are eligible for $1200 in direct assistance for prescription drug costs. 
   * Beginning in 2006, all seniors will have prescription drug coverage if they choose. 
   * $89 Billion will be provided to help retirees keep the benefits they have and like.

  Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today joined Reps. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) and John J. Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.) in applauding the announcement by the Department of Homeland Security that a local site is a finalist for the location of a new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). 
   The site in Pulaski County, Ky., was nominated by the Kentucky/Tennessee NBAF Consortium, which partners the University of Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory with the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, and other university and industry partners.
   The new national lab will research biological threats involving human, zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. DHS estimates the facility will contain approximately 500,000 square feet of lab space, with construction costs running upwards of $450 million. Once operational, the facility is expected to directly support over 400 jobs with an annual payroll of $30.5 million. The effort to bring the facility to the region is supported by the governors and congressional delegations of both Tennessee and Kentucky.
   ""East Tennessee has a long tradition of research that benefits homeland security, and today's announcement brings us one step closer to adding to that impressive legacy,"" Frist said. ""Locating this research facility in the region would create jobs, benefit the local economy and further cement East Tennessee's standing as a one of the nation's premier scientific research communities. I commend the consortium for their efforts and will continue to work with them and the congressional delegation to bring this opportunity to the region.""
   ""This is very good news, and I am proud of the work in Tennessee and Kentucky that has gone into this effort,"" Alexander said. ""Tennessee's capabilities for performing innovative work in this area are unique and growing. I expect the proposal from the Kentucky-Tennessee partnership for siting this new national lab to be very competitive. I applaud Hal Rogers for his leadership at the federal level on this important effort.""
   ""The strong partnership of the University of Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory would give any consortium the strength to compete for a major mission in Homeland Security or research of this nature,"" Wamp said. ""I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Hal Rogers in putting these great institutions together. We are committed to this partnership and hope to stay competitive throughout this process.""
   ""We have many valuable scientific resources in our region and I am pleased that DHS recognizes East Tennessee's potential to further our nation's bio-defense research,"" said Duncan. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues and the consortium to bring this facility to our area.""
   DHS will continue to evaluate and conduct site visits to the 14 proposed sites and could announce a final selection early next year.

FRIST REFLECTS ON PASSING OF MENTOR, RENOWNED HEART SURGEON DR. NORM SHUMWAY
  World-renowned heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway passed away today at his home in California at the age of 83. Shumway was the first surgeon to perform a successful heart transplant in the United States. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. studied with Shumway at Stanford for two years beginning in 1985 before returning to Nashville, TN where he established a multi-organ transplant center at Vanderbilt University. The following are excerpts from Frist's reflections on Shumway's legacy as a world-class surgeon, teacher, mentor and friend: 
   ""Norman Shumway was the inspirational leader and guiding spirit who made heart transplants a reality. When all those around him said it could never happen his vision, his determination, his unrelenting commitment and pioneer spirit saved thousands of lives.  
   ""His gift was the rare blend of long-term thinking, a love of medicine and a true pioneering spirit that inspired and attracted like-minded individuals from across the country and around the world. 
   ""He was fond of remarking that his role as a surgeon was comparable to that of being the world's greatest second assistant, and his humble yet visionary work is now reflected in surgical programs all over the world. He loved his role as an assistant healer and cherished the opportunity to not only operate and innovate, but to share and teach. I've worked with a lot of cardiac surgeons and been in academic programs at Mass General (in Boston) and back at Vanderbilt and I think more than anybody that I interacted with over my 20 years doing it, Dr. Shumway was the one who has had the most, broadest influence on overall academic and clinical surgery because of his unparalleled commitment to teaching. 
   ""He was a pioneer because of the complexities involved in the operations, yet he was able to keep things accessible. One of his most common quotes was to remind us to keep it simple. ""If it looks complex, it's not right,"" he was fond of saying again and again. 
   ""Never be afraid to double dribble..."" What that meant to me as a surgeon, was if it is not perfect, put that second stitch in or remove it and put the first one in. If it takes 2 stitches that's what it takes - don't be afraid to do that instead of hotshotting it through the operation. 
   ""Shumway would look for somebody who had the genius, who had the entrepreneurial spirit, who was a free thinker and he would encourage them. He had this sort of 6th sense of attracting people who shared his pioneering spirit. 
   ""He would take people early on and give them the freedom to think creatively and with innovation. As a product of that, he attracted pioneering people and considered it part of his mission to nurture and cultivate that ambition and drive .... didn't matter what age you were, what your status was, didn't matter if you were a 1st year resident or a 5th year resident or an assistant professor, if you had a good idea, he would nurture it, he would encourage it, he would give you the freedom to explore. It was a very different mentality from Boston or New York where you are used to more traditional thinking..."" 
   ""If you had an idea, he would literally set up a little laboratory around you and encourage it. The inspiration and nurturing even extended beyond the field of medicine. Given the unique type of drive that inspired a person to study with Dr. Shumway, it was not unexpected when individuals found other challenging problems that may have been outside of the field of medicine. And when other challenges came along - and you showed the same spirit that drew you to Dr. Shumway in the first place, he nurtured it too. And you knew it was okay to take on those risks too because he said it was ok. 
   ""He was mentor. A great surgeon. And a true friend. I will miss him dearly.""
