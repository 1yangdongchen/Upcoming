  Today, Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced that Adams County will receive $355,000 from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The funds will go toward the construction of an access road for the Adams County Hospital in the Village of Seaman. 
   ""I have worked hard to help this region meet its economic needs,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The construction of this road and the new county hospital will improve quality of life and further bolster the region's healthcare capabilities.""  
   The ARC funds will be used for engineering services, site work and construction for approximately 2,500 feet - almost half a mile - of a two-lane access road to serve the new hospital which is relocating to a new, 10-acre campus in the village. The new road will provide vital access to the hospital and support the retention of over 250 jobs in the area as well as create 28 new jobs by the third year of the new hospital's operation, according to the Commission. In addition, the project will ensure $22.5 million in capital investment for the hospital. 
   In addition to the ARC funds, the Village of Seaman will contribute $180,000 to the project, with estimated total project costs of $535,000. 
   The U.S. Senate last month passed by unanimous consent S. 2832 - vital legislation to reauthorize the ARC at $510.9 million over five years. Sen. Voinovich, a member of the EPW Committee, introduced the bill in May. 
   In April, Sen. Voinovich held a field hearing in Marietta, Ohio, to hear testimony on the impact of the last reauthorization of the ARC and to examine how ARC has made a difference in people's lives. After the hearing, he spent two days traveling around Appalachian Ohio and was extremely impressed with the wonderful strides being made in the region as a result of ARC investments in technology, workforce training, and economic development. 
   ARC plays a key role in fostering economic development and improving quality of life for the 23 million people who live and work in Appalachia. The proposed legislation creates the designation of economically ""at risk"" counties and provides an appropriate federal matching rate for ARC-funded projects in those counties. Since ARC's inception, the region's poverty rate has been cut in half (from 31 percent to 13 percent), the infant mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds, and the percentage of adults with high school education has increased by over 70 percent. 
   Key elements of the legislation: 
   * Renews the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years (2007 - 2011). The agency's current authorization expires September 30, 2006. The proposed legislation is the same length as the bipartisan authorization Congress approved in 2002. 
   * Authorizes the Commission for five years at the following levels: 
   2007: $95.2 million 
   2008: $98.6 million 
   2009: $102 million 
   2010: $105.7 million 
   2011: $109.4 million 
   * The bill directs the Commission annually to designate those counties that are ""at risk"" of becoming economically distressed. These counties have fragile economies that are just on the cusp of meeting the criteria for being designated as distressed. The Commission itself recently adopted this targeting classification. The legislation would codify the Commission's existing practice. 
   * Permits ARC to fund projects in the ""at risk"" counties at up to 70 percent of the cost of the project. Under current law, these projects may only be funded at 50 percent (the match rate for most ARC counties), while projects in designated distressed counties can be funded at 80 percent of the project costs. This provision reflects the special needs of ""at risk"" counties. 
   * Maintains the requirement that at least 50 percent of the Commission's grant dollars go for projects or activities benefiting distressed counties and areas. This provision was added in ARC's 2002 reauthorization. The Commission currently satisfies this requirement, and no change is proposed. 
   * Continues all existing programmatic authorities, including the special program in telecommunications and technology. The bill proposes no changes in ARC's general programs, nor does it create any new authorities because of the strong history of accomplishment. 
   During his first term in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich authored the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 (S. 1206), which was signed by the president on March 12, 2002. The bill reauthorized the economic development efforts of the Appalachian Regional Commission, providing $446 million over five years for these efforts, and enacted a new, Voinovich-created technology initiative to help improve the region's telecommunication infrastructure and help businesses and residents take better advantage of e-commerce opportunities.

VOINOVICH COMMENTS ON UNFUNDED MANDATES/WATER INFRASTRUCTURE
  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, today sent a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson urging the EPA to provide more funding and flexibility for cities in complying with EPA's mandates on water and sewer infrastructure. While cities are forced to comply with federal regulations or face federal fines, the funding is nearly nonexistent - making these regulations unfunded mandates.
  The proposed 2009 budget cuts funding to the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund to $555 million - the lowest funding level in the program's history. Sen. Voinovich would like to increase the budget to $1.35 billion to ensure Washington isn't forcing cities into bankruptcy. The cost for Ohio's cities is estimated to be around $12 billion. That's more than 10 times what the entire nation received in funding to help comply with these mandates. These costs - which are often larger than a small city's entire yearly budget - are incurred by cities and passed along to taxpayers. 
  Please see below for the letter:
  February 11, 2008
  The Honorable Stephen Johnson
  Administrator
  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
  Ariel Rios Building
  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20460
  Dear Administrator Johnson:
  I write today out of concern and frustration that we are facing an environmental and public health crisis in this country when it comes to water infrastructure. This is an issue that has been a long-standing concern of mine, and one that frankly, I feel is not being adequately prioritized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
  I have been interested in this subject for over 20 years. While mayor of the city of Cleveland, I experienced firsthand the difficulties in finding funding for water infrastructure. As governor, I successfully worked with Congress to rewrite the Safe Drinking Water Act that gave state and local governments more power in protecting their water supply and continually fought for legislation to further support and improve the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. As Senator, I have continually supported legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and to increase funding for this important program. 
  Last September, I attended an Environment and Public Works Subcommittee hearing called ""Meeting America's Wastewater Infrastructure Needs in the 21st Century."" At the hearing, I stressed my concern about the lack of funding for water and wastewater infrastructure projects to fulfill mandates from EPA. Many communities in Ohio and across the nation do not have the fiscal capacity or the federal aid needed to upgrade their water and wastewater systems as mandated by EPA. 
  New reports have shed additionally light on the crisis. As you know, the recently released Clean Watersheds Needs Survey 2004 estimates the national needs for the wastewater treatment and collection at $193.5 billion. Ohio ranks as having one of the largest wastewater treatment collection needs at $11.7 billion. Only New York, Illinois and California have greater needs. For example, representatives of a sewer district in Northeast Ohio informed me that they will have to impose a rate increase of at least 12 percent each year for the next 30 years to finance the $80 to 120 million annual capital program mandated by EPA. This rate increase is on top of the $2.1 billion the sewer district has already spent to meet Clean Water Act requirements. 
  Combined sewer overflow (CSO) also continues to be a problem. Combined sewer systems serve roughly 772 communities and roughly 40 million people nationwide. During heavy rainfall, CSO discharges can lead to serious water pollution problems. Your agency has identified almost $6.3 billion of improvements as necessary to address CSO problems in over 100 communities throughout Ohio. City officials in Akron, Ohio have proposed spending $426 million over 30 years to fix their city's CSO problems. Here again, EPA is not stepping up to the plate to assist a community substantially costs needed to mitigate the negative environmental and health effects brought about by an inadequate wastewater system. I must tell you that most communities consider this to be an unfunded mandate. Many of my communities are facing significant economic woes with major employers threatening to leave. Their ratepayers cannot afford these increases. 
  If the federal government is going to impose costly mandates on struggling state and local governments, then it should provide funding for compliance with those mandates. One of the most effective and popular sources of funding for wastewater collection and treatment projects is the Clean Water SRF Program. Billions of dollars have been distributed though the program to upgrade the nation's aging wastewater infrastructure. That is why I am continually disappointed that EPA's budgets propose severe spending cuts for the program.
  Time and again I have expressed my frustrations and urged EPA to provide the leadership necessary to resolve this problem. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many of my constituents, that has yet to happen. I strongly believe that if EPA is not able to provide the necessary assistance to communities struggling to comply with federal mandates, some flexibility must be given to communities that are grappling to find the financial capacity to get the job done. 
  All parties involved need to come together to find a solution to this crisis. I would like to receive your suggestions on how relief could be provided to communities struggling to comply with various EPA mandates. 
  I look forward to working with you and my colleagues to address the unmet water and wastewater infrastructure needs in this country. Together, I believe we can ensure that our towns and communities have the funding and flexibility needed to upgrade our aging infrastructure without unnecessarily burdening already strained local economies. 
  Sincerely,
  George V. Voinovich
  United States Senator

September 11 quickened the pace for a stronger relationship by underscoring the commonalities between our democracies and cementing our mutual commitment to work more closely together. I will work to continue that close relationship as we move forward toward a safer world free from terror."".

VOINOVICH ANNOUNCES SILVER, LARGESCALE SILVER CARP TO BE LABELED INJURIOUS SPECIES
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) announced today that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final rule designating silver and largescale silver carp as injurious species under the Lacey Act. The regulation, which will go into effect August 9, 2007, bans importation and interstate transport of live silver and largescale carp. Sen. George Voinovich, along with 24 other members of Congress in 2002, strongly supported the designation to the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The regulation, which will go into effect August 9, 2007, bans importation and interstate transport of live silver and largescale carp. Sen. Voinovich, along with 24 other members of Congress in 2002, strongly supported the designation to the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   ""This designation will send a clear message to the nation that the Great Lakes region is committed to protecting the Lakes from all invasive species, including silver carp,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""We have worked hard to revitalize the Lakes and these foreign species are a serious threat to the native fish population, the ecosystem and the fishing and boating community. We need to do everything in our power to help guard against them."" 
   Silver carp were introduced to the United States in the 1970s as a management tool for sewage lagoons and fishery production ponds. The carp made their way north to the Illinois River after escaping from fish farms during massive flooding along the Mississippi River more than 10 years ago. Silver carp are difficult to handle and transport because of their tendency to jump - growing up to three feet long and 60 pounds in weight, silver carp have leaped into moving boats injuring people and damaging equipment. 
   Biologists worry that silver carp could spread through large rivers and lakes in the U.S. and compete with native species for food and habitat, having both ecological and economic impacts and threatening, for example, the multimillion-dollar Great Lakes fishery. 
   Since the beginning of his political career, Sen. Voinovich has committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the Great Lakes. Forty years ago, when he was elected to the Ohio State Legislature, he waged what he refers to as the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lakes. Through his efforts in the Senate, Sen. Voinovich was influential in providing important funding for the construction of preventive electric barriers located on the Illinois River and in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes.

VOINOVICH INTRODUCES BILL AIMED AT JOB DEVELOPMENT, KEEPING AMERICA COMPETITIVE
  U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-OH) today introduced legislation aimed at creating new jobs by making it easier for states to implement regional workforce and economic development programs that meet the needs of the workers and employers. The Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development Act of 2008, or the WIRED Act, will assist states in attracting and retaining businesses and jobs by helping to ensure that a state can leverage federal workforce dollars towards the development of a well-trained workforce.
   ""My legislation works to ensure that America's workforce includes the right people with the right skills in the right place at the right time,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Global competition is often seen as a national challenge, but the regional level is where solutions must be developed to meet that challenge. Local economies are where companies, workers, educators, researchers, entrepreneurs, philanthropies and governments come together to create competitive advantages and where new ideas and knowledge are transformed into advanced, high-quality products and services."" 
   Sen. Voinovich's bill will allow regions to effectively align education, workforce and economic development systems toward meeting regional economic needs. It provides a framework through which regions can:
   * Identify assets, opportunities and risks;
   * Establish regional economic goals; and 
   * Develop workforce and economic development strategies that will help achieve those goals.
   The WIRED Act amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), which was passed by Congress to authorize service and training for youths, adults and laid-off or dislocated workers to give states and regions greater flexibility in their use of federal workforce development dollars. It also allows states to focus on developing more regional and demand-driven workforce programs and increases the ability for economic and workforce development funds to be used to leverage scarce federal dollars. Currently, WIA program funds cannot easily be used across program areas. As a result, the existing workforce training system is not fully meeting workers and employers' needs.
   Despite Ohio's relatively high unemployment rate (5.5 percent compared to the national average of 4.9 percent in January 2008) and many economic challenges, Ohio will return roughly $20 million in unspent WIA dollars from prior years as part of a federal rescission of these funds. This is happening, in part, because reallocating these funds to address other workforce development needs is too cumbersome. At the same time, recent press reports indicate that Ohio's employers are having a difficult time finding the highly-skilled workers they need to compete.
   ""When Ohio's vital workforce development dollars are being returned to the federal government, new tools must be developed to ensure the state's workforce and economic development needs are met,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""The opportunities are there, but employers cannot find the highly-skilled workers they need. When this happens, there is a disconnect between the needs of our nation's workers, the needs of our nation's employers and the design of the workforce development system. The WIRED Act will help states like Ohio by giving them greater flexibility to tailor workforce and economic development programs to address the needs of the 21st century global marketplace.""
   Sen. Voinovich's bill would authorize three new voluntary programs within the existing WIA framework that would allow states and regions to develop and implement strategies to strengthen or revitalize regional economies by giving states and regions greater flexibility to tailor workforce programs to meet local needs. The bill: 
   * Authorizes states and regions to work with a governor (or governors in the case of multi-state regions) to submit WIRED plans for approval by the Secretary of Labor. The plans must be aimed at crafting targeted workforce development programs that provide enhanced job training and related employment activities in the region. They may include complementary economic development activities. If approved, the plans could allow states to combine a number of different federal workforce and economic development funds;
   * Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to award supplementary grants to assist in implementing a WIRED plan or to carry out other regionally-focused workforce development activities; and
   * Authorizes the use of formula funds available to states and local areas under WIA to carry out regionally-focused workforce development activities without going through the entire WIRED approval process. As stated earlier, some of this vital funding is currently going unused because of the inflexibility of the WIA program.
   By making these three voluntary options broadly available, the bill is intended to empower states and local communities to address the workforce challenges posed by global competition and economic change. The WIRED Act builds and expands upon the principles underlying the WIRED Initiative that was begun by the Department of Labor in 2006 and currently provides assistance to 39 regions across the country, including a WIRED region in southeast Ohio.

VOINOVICH VOTES IN FAVOR OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE
  Sen George V. Voinovich (R-OH) voted today against H.R. 4297, the Tax Relief Act of 2005. The senator's vote-that of a well-known deficit hawk-reflects his strong belief that the decisions he and his colleagues make in the Senate today will affect the lives of their children and grandchildren long after they have left the Senate.  
   ""I voted against additional tax cuts today for three simple reasons: we do not need them right now; we cannot afford them right now; and we should be working on fundamental tax reform rather than tinkering with piecemeal tax cuts. I am thinking not only about our generation, but also the generations of our children and grandchildren and the legacy we leave them. Last November, Alan Greenspan testified before the Joint Economic Committee and warned Congress that we should not be cutting taxes by borrowing: 'We do not have the capability of having both productive tax cuts and large expenditure increases, and presume that the deficit doesn't matter.' I wish my colleagues had heeded his warning,"" said Voinovich. 
   As a former mayor and governor, Senator Voinovich understands the importance of making difficult decisions when necessary. The choices Congress makes right now are being measured against a backdrop of ever-increasing deficits, Medicare costs, disaster relief funding, the cost of the war against terrorism and the challenges of staying competitive in the global marketplace. Senator Voinovich believes the passage of these tax cuts is fiscally irresponsible and has called on his colleagues to be intellectually honest with the American people. 
   The Senator opposed tax cuts at this time for three reasons: 1. The economy is back on track and does not need additional tax cuts. While he voted for tax cuts in 2001, which prevented Congress from spending the projected $5.6 trillion surplus, and he voted for the 2003 tax cuts because the country needed an economic stimulus, Senator Voinovich believes that an overdose of tax cuts will do more harm than good at this time. 2. We cannot afford them at this time because of our soaring deficit and national debt. The reported deficit for FY2005 was $318 billion; taking out the Social Security surplus and using the on-budget deficit, the number was $492 billion; and utilizing the Treasury's accrual accounting method, the deficit was $760 billion. The national debt has increased from $5.6 trillion in 1999 to $8.4 trillion today - an increase of 50 percent. The House is now contemplating increasing the debt limit to $10 trillion, which, if reached, would be an increase of 78 percent. If the Senate believes we must have them, then we need to pay for them. 3. We should be working on tax reform rather than enacting tax cuts in a piece-meal fashion.

   ""My memories of visiting the Pentagon and being at Ground Zero shortly after the attacks will never fade. I was overcome by the size, scale and devastation of the sites and nothing could have prepared me for the gut-wrenching reaction to these savage acts. 
   ""The brutality of 9/11 shocked the world. But rather than destroying our faith in the American ideals of liberty and freedom, it united us in a way I have never seen before. 
   ""We are still battling the Islamic extremists who attacked us on 9/11. They are still working throughout the world to convince Muslims that the way to get to Heaven is to terrorize - and ultimately destroy - the United States and all who share our values. 
   ""We must not let the victims of 9/11 die in vain. We must continue the Global War on Terror, working with our friends and allies throughout the world to stop the terrorists, deny them safe haven and freeze their financial networks. Only then can we limit their ability to spread fear, resentment, despair and violence among their own people and abroad. 
   ""I have urged President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to be very clear about our objectives in Iraq so that everyone can understand how it relates to the Global War on Terror and the future stability in the Greater Middle East. Without stability in the Middle East, we cannot win the greater ideological battle between moderation and extremism, between those who promote democracy and those who want to destroy freedom. Our mission in Iraq is critical to preventing the Middle East from becoming a massive breeding ground for the terrorists of the future.

  Sen. George V. Voinovich (R-OH), ranking member of the Oversight of Government Management subcommittee, on Monday, Feb. 12, introduced the Homeland Security Management Act of 2007 along with Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-HI). This bill will elevate the roles and responsibilities of the current Undersecretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security to a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security for Management. The new position will oversee the challenges associated with creating a unified identity for the 22 federal agencies and 180,000 employees that make up Department of Homeland Security. 
  ""I am convinced the existing management structure at the department is insufficient, and is hampering its ability to be successful,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""Through this legislation, the creation of a Deputy Secretary for Management will provide essential expertise necessary for improving the long-term efficiency and effectiveness of the department.""
  The individual appointed as the Deputy Secretary for Management will serve a five-year term and be the third highest ranking official at DHS. The roles and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Management include serving as the chief management officer and principal advisor to the secretary on the management of the department, including management integration and transformation in support of homeland security operations and programs.
  The Deputy Secretary for Management will also be responsible for strategic and annual performance planning, identification and tracking of performance measures relating to the responsibilities of the department, as well as the integration and transformation process, including the development of a management integration strategy. 
  In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) added implementing and transforming the Department of Homeland Security to their high-risk list of programs susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. It remains on the 2007 list. The creation of the Deputy Secretary for Management will address the concerns outlined by GAO. 
  U.S. Senators Carl Levin (D-MI) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) are original co-sponsors of the bill.

VOINOVICH TO CO-CHAIR SENATE GREAT LAKES TASK FORCE
  On Friday, January 12, Sen. George V. Voinovich, a longtime friend of the Great Lakes, announced that he has become co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. The bipartisan group, part of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, seeks to protect the environmental and economic health of the Great Lakes region.  
  ""Protecting and restoring the Great Lakes has been a top priority for me throughout my political career,"" Sen. Voinovich said. ""As co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, I look forward to working with Senator Carl Levin and the Great Lakes delegation in advancing the restoration effort in this critical region. Working in a bipartisan effort, we can achieve this goal and protect the Great Lakes for generations to come."" 
  The Senate and House Great Lakes Task Forces were formed in the mid-1980s by members of the Northeast-Midwest Senate and Congressional Coalitions to work in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to protect and enhance the region's unique natural resources and economy. The Democratic co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force is Senator Carl Levin (D-MI). Leaders of the House Great Lakes Task Force are Reps. John Dingell (D-MI), Vernon Ehlers (R-MI), Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Louise Slaughter (D-NY).
  Sen. Voinovich has a long history of support for the Great Lakes. In 1967, when he was elected to the state legislature with Lake Erie forming the northern border of his district, he saw firsthand the effects of pollution on Lake Erie and the surrounding region. In response, he committed himself to stopping the deterioration of the Lake and waging what he calls the ""Second Battle of Lake Erie"" - the battle to reclaim and restore Ohio's Great Lake.
  Since coming to the Senate in 1999, Senator Voinovich has supported numerous pieces of legislation to ban oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes, protect the Lakes from invasive species like the Asian carp, fight ""dead zones"" that threaten the Lakes' vibrant plant and animal life and fund vital cleanup of contaminated sediments.
  The senator has also joined with federal agencies, governors, mayors, tribes and various other organizations to develop a comprehensive restoration plan for the Great Lakes. After extensive discussions, the Federal Great lakes Interagency Task Force, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, the Great Lakes Cities Initiative, Great Lakes tribes and the Great Lakes Congressional Task Force moved to convene a group now known as the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration (GLRC). Since May 18, 2004, the GLRC has worked hard to develop a comprehensive Great Lakes restoration plan. 
  On July 7, 2005, the GLRC released its draft strategy report and a final comprehensive report was released on December 12, 2005, in Chicago, Illinois. This report reflected a bipartisan effort to help tackle the issue of restoration in the Great Lakes region. Throughout this process, Senator Voinovich has been actively involved, urging the Collaboration to develop a final plan that immediately impacts the Great Lakes in a positive manner while being fiscally responsible. Senator Voinovich will continue to be involved as Congress will likely be asked to implement many of the GLRC recommendations in the 110th Congress.

  Durbin  Murray  Obama Introduce Bill to Update Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury for Military   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Durbin  Murray  Obama Introduce Bill to Update Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury for Military Thursday  May 10  2007   WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation  yesterday evening  to improve the care of veterans and service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries  TBI    The bipartisan Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act would establish a program within the Departments of Defense  DOD  and Veteran Affairs  VA  that would provide individualized services  improve coordination between the two agencies  require routine brain injury screening tests for military personnel  increase TBI patient benefits  improve case oversight and expand TBI research in the Defense Department and the VA      Too many of our brave service men and women are coming home from war with serious injuries that may be overlooked because they don   t bear any visible wounds or scars     Durbin said     We owe them the best treatment and support  while learning more about these injuries and their treatment   With that knowledge  we can moderate the impact TBI has on the lives of our veterans and their families       Last year  Senator Durbin introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that allocated an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007  That authorization was included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill this January  at Senator Durbin   s urging  That amendment as well as this bill has been endorsed by Veterans for America    Joining Durbin as cosponsors of the bill are Senators John Warner  R VA   Patty Murray  D WA   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Barack Obama  D IL   James Webb  D VA  and Maria Cantwell  D WA    Senator Patty Murray  D WA   an original cosponsor of the bill said    TBI has clearly emerged as the signature injury of the War in Iraq  Unfortunately  the response to treating and understanding it has lagged  leaving our veterans and their families searching for answers  This bill makes TBI research  benefits  and coordination top priorities at the DOD and VA  It also requires routine screening   a critical step toward ensuring that service members with TBI don   t slip through the cracks          Troubling recent reports have made clear that a high percentage of service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from mental health problems and traumatic brain injuries  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling through the cracks     said Senator Obama      As we prepare our nation to assist the generation of service members returning home from war  we must implement comprehensive reforms that provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those with traumatic brain injuries   Providing the best treatment for our service members is one thing about this war we can still get right     Durbin   s bill addresses the following issues  Standard of Care   The act will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Program  run by DOD and the VA  to provide treatment and rehabilitation to service members and veterans who have suffered a service connected traumatic brain injury   It will provide a clear standard ensuring that every service member and veteran suffering a traumatic brain injury will receive the services that best meet their individual needs   Screening   DOD will be required to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre test to be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and upon return from deployment to determine if possible brain injury exists   The act will also require DOD and the VA to conduct outreach to advise service members and veterans about the TBI Program  their rights and responsibilities  treatment and rehabilitation options and the availability of screening   Case Management and Health Care Services   Inefficiencies in case management as well as the complex nature of care required by TBI patients has led to patient and family confusion  contradictory guidance and treatment  and a number of instances in which patients did not receive proper care   This act directs DOD and the VA to assign each patient a lead case manager to ease the stress on patient and family  facilitate navigation through the DoD and VA systems  ensure adequate care is being provided  prevent duplication of efforts  and avoid contradictory guidance   Additionally  DOD and the VA must assign each patient a lead primary care physician to coordinate and oversee the care provided to the participant  including all treatment  rehabilitation  and medications   Overlap of Benefits   To ensure members receive the best care and rehabilitation available  all participants enrolled in the program shall  for the first two years  receive any of the benefits available to veterans and to active duty members  regardless of their active duty status   Patients    Rights     DOD and the VA must also make available an appeals process to challenge any failure to provide the standard of care required in the TBI Program  They must also provide a referral to a medical professional outside of the DOD and VA when requested by a TBI patient   Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war  The widespread use of improvised explosive devices  IED   s  has created thousands of TBI victims  sometimes with no other visible signs of injury  The concussions from IED explosion cause sudden  violent head movements which often lead to a TBI  With symptoms similar to that of shaken baby syndrome  TBI   s are difficult to diagnose  Injured service members may suffer from headaches  confusion  dizziness and lightheadedness in mild cases  to mood changes  loss of memory  convulsions  weakness or numbness in the extremities  and loss of coordination in more severe cases

   Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans Tuesday  April 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt Homes for Heroes Act would provide support to nation   s 200 000 veterans in need WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  was today joined by Senators Charles Schumer  D NY   Robert Menendez  D NJ   and Sherrod Brown  D OH  in introducing the Homes for Heroes Act  a bill that would expand housing and rental assistance for homeless veterans   The Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  estimates that approximately 200 000 adult veterans live on the streets or in shelters on any given day  and nearly twice as many are homeless at some point during the year       As we work to end the war in Iraq  we must also prepare to deal with the generation of service members returning home from war     said Senator Obama      As long as there are veterans or veteran family members searching for shelter on the streets  and as long as there are wounded service members receiving substandard medical care  we have failed in our duty to honor the commitment of the brave men and women who chose to serve   We must provide our returning heroes and their families with every resource they need to rebuild their lives          As we   ve seen at Walter Reed and elsewhere  our veterans returning from war have not received the help and resources they deserve     said Senator Schumer      The thousands of homeless veterans are just another stark example of how the Administration has let our veterans down  This bill will right this wrong by providing the men and women who have served our country with housing assistance   Too many veterans need a roof over their heads and it   s time we provide it now      Senator Robert Menendez said     A grateful nation should work to ensure that the men and women who risked their lives serving their country are not left stranded when they fall on hard times back home  Just as we have acted to improve health care for injured veterans  we should act to make sure veterans can put a roof over their heads          There are more than 2 000 homeless veterans in Ohio  They fought for us  We should fight for them  That s what this bill is about  and I am proud to support it     Senator Brown said   The    Homes for Heroes Act    will address these concerns by   I  Establishing Permanent Housing and Services for Low Income Veterans   Families The bill would expand the supply of permanent affordable housing for low income veteran families  This would not only provide shelter for homeless veteran families  but also help prevent low income families from falling into homelessness   The bill establishes a  225 million assistance program for community and nonprofit organizations

WHITEHOUSE BACKS SENATE EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN HATE CRIME STATUTE
  Citing the need to give local law enforcement stronger tools to prosecute hate crimes, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Thursday, April 12, added his support to new legislation that will include sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability status as part of the federal hate crimes statute.  
   ""Crimes of hate are unacceptable and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Whitehouse. ""I'm proud to support legislation that aims to end these crimes of bias forever."" 
   Currently, only 27 states and Washington, D.C. classify gender-based crimes as hate crimes; 31 states and Washington, D.C. include sexual-orientation based crimes; and only 31 states and Washington, D.C. include disability-based crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has documented more than 114,000 hate crimes since 1991. 
   The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2007, introduced today by Senators Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), will give local law enforcement officials important tools, like training or direct assistance, to combat crimes that show evidence of prejudice based on sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability status. 
   The bill also would encourage Americans to report hate crimes, through increased public education and awareness, and would allow local prosecutors to pursue bias-motivated crime under federal law in areas in which state statutes are inadequate. 
   A similar version of the measure, which had broad, bipartisan support, was passed by both the House and Senate in the 109th Congress, but was scuttled in a conference committee and ultimately did not become law.

WHITEHOUSE MEASURE SAFEGUARDING PRIVACY AGAINST GOVERNMENT SPYING
  During its consideration of reforms to a federal law that sets restrictions on when the government can spy on Americans, the U.S. Senate today passed an amendment sponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) that significantly strengthens judicial oversight and safeguards the privacy rights of innocent Americans who are not targeted for surveillance.  
  ""The Bush administration unilaterally assumed extraordinary authority to tap Americans' phones and to invade Americans' privacy - with seemingly no regard for individual rights,"" said Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We need to assure that rules protecting Americans' rights are being followed, and because this administration fears and rejects judicial oversight, that is precisely what is most needed.""
  In 2005, the New York Times reported on a Bush administration program to wiretap electronic communications by Americans inside the country without first obtaining warrants, in an apparent attempt to sidestep the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978, which sets strict limits on domestic government spying. In August of last year, under pressure from the administration to revise the existing law, Congress passed the Protect America Act (P.L. 110-55), which authorized expanded surveillance, but did not authorize the court that oversees the FISA program to ensure that any privacy protections were being implemented.
  The Senate is now considering new legislation to repair the problems of the Protect America Act, an effort in which Whitehouse has been deeply involved. Whitehouse's amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 2248) focuses on protections for Americans who are not the target of surveillance, but whose information or conversations may be incidentally intercepted during surveillance of a targeted person. In domestic law enforcement, there are clear, established procedures for ""minimizing"" the collection or retention of this information, to ensure that the privacy of innocent Americans is protected, and the prospect of judicial review is an important part of this protection. 
  S. 2248 gives the FISA Court the authority to approve minimization procedures, but says nothing about the Court's corresponding inherent authority, common to all courts, to review whether the procedures it has approved are being followed, and to order compliance. The Whitehouse amendment would repair that flaw by making clear that nothing in S. 2248 reduces or contravenes the FISA Court's inherent authority to enforce compliance with the Court-approved minimization procedures. 
  ""As a former U.S. attorney and Rhode Island attorney general who oversaw wiretaps and other surveillance procedures, I've seen that law enforcement officials are more likely to follow the rules when there is a strong prospect of judicial oversight,"" Whitehouse said. ""It makes no sense to limit the court's inherent authority to see whether rules it has approved are being followed, and to enforce compliance with these approved rules. It is not up to the executive branch to grade its own exams. That is a job for the courts.""

WHITEHOUSE, DURBIN CALL FOR WATERBOARDING INVESTIGATION
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in a letter to two Justice Department watchdog offices today to request an investigation into the role of Justice Department officials in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both senators are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
  ""Despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal, certain Justice Department officials, operating behind a veil of secrecy, concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful,"" the senators wrote. ""The Justice Department's continued refusal to repudiate waterboarding does tremendous damage to America's values and image in the world and places Americans at risk of being subjected to waterboarding by enemy forces. We believe it merits investigation to determine if these grievous results were the product of legal theories violating the Department's professional standards, or improper influence violating the Department's standards for independent legal advice."" 
  Last year, Whitehouse asked Judge Michael B. Mukasey, then the Bush administration's nominee to be Attorney General, whether the practice of waterboarding is torture or is constitutional. Mukasey's failure to state definitively that waterboarding is torture led Whitehouse to vote against his nomination, and Whitehouse has since joined a series of efforts by Senator Durbin and other Judiciary Committee Democrats to press the Attorney General to reassess its conclusion that the practice is legal. In a hearing last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Whitehouse is a member, General Michael Hayden, director of the CIA, publicly acknowledged for the first time that the U.S. government had used waterboarding during interrogations of several detainees, including Khalid Sheik Mohammed.

  Counsel for Professional Responsibility
  U.S. Department of Justice
  950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Room 3266
  Washington, D.C. 20530
   Dear Inspector General Fine and Counsel Jarrett:
  We request that you investigate the role of Justice Department officials in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Attorney General Michael Mukasey refuses to investigate the Administration's authorization and use of waterboarding. CIA Director Michael Hayden has testified that the CIA waterboarded three detainees, and Attorney General Mukasey has testified that, ""There are circumstances where waterboarding is clearly unlawful."" Nonetheless, the Attorney General refused Senator Durbin's request to investigate because he does ""not believe such an investigation is necessary, appropriate, or legally sustainable."" 
   Attorney General Mukasey admitted that, ""the CIA sought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department informed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the circumstances and within the limits and the safeguards of the program."" The Attorney General's justification for refusing to open an investigation is that, ""no one who relied in good faith on the Department's past advice should be subject to criminal investigation for actions taken in reliance on that advice."" However, this does not address Senator Durbin's request that ""a Justice Department investigation should explore whether waterboarding was authorized and whether those who authorized it violated the law"" (our emphasis).
   Waterboarding has a sordid history in the annals of torture by repressive regimes, from the Spanish Inquisition to the Khmer Rouge. The United States has always repudiated waterboarding as a form of torture and prosecuted it as a war crime. The Judge Advocates General, the highest-ranking attorneys in each of the four military services, have stated unequivocally that waterboarding is illegal and violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
   Yet, despite the virtually unanimous consensus of legal scholars and the overwhelming weight of legal precedent that waterboarding is illegal, certain Justice Department officials, operating behind a veil of secrecy, concluded that the use of waterboarding is lawful. We believe it is appropriate for you to investigate the conduct of these Justice Department officials. As you know, a similar investigation is underway regarding Justice Department officials who advised the National Security Agency that its warrantless surveillance program is lawful.
   To restore the faith of our intelligence professionals and the American people in the Justice Department's ability to provide accurate and honest legal advice, we request that you make your findings public. 
   We ask that you explore, among other things:
   Did Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful perform legal work that meets applicable standards of professional responsibility and internal Justice Department policies and standards? For example, did these officials consider all relevant legal precedents, including those that appear to contradict directly their conclusion that waterboarding is lawful? Did these officials consult with government attorneys who are experts in the relevant legal standards, e.g. Judge Advocates General who are experts in the Geneva Conventions? Was it reasonable to rely on standards found in areas such as health care reimbursement law in evaluating interrogation techniques? 
   Were Justice Department officials who advised the CIA that waterboarding is lawful insulated from outside pressure to reach a particular conclusion? What role did White House and/or CIA officials play in deliberations about the lawfulness of waterboarding? 
  We agree with Attorney General Mukasey that our intelligence professionals should be able to rely in good faith on the Justice Department's legal advice. However, if CIA agents or contractors have been put in jeopardy by misguided counsel from the Justice Department, including legal opinions that the Administration has been forced to repudiate, and as a result they risk war crimes prosecution overseas, this is a serious matter. It also places CIA agents at risk of receiving similarly flawed advice in the future. Moreover, the Justice Department's continued refusal to repudiate waterboarding does tremendous damage to America's values and image in the world and places Americans at risk of being subjected to waterboarding by enemy forces. We believe it merits investigation to determine if these grievous results were the product of legal theories violating the Department's professional standards, or improper influence violating the Department's standards for independent legal advice. 
  We respectfully request that you inform us whether you plan to initiate a review as soon as possible, and no later than February 19, 2008. We also request that you inform us whether the results of your review will be provided to Congress and made public. Thank you for your time and consideration.
   Sincerely,
   Richard J. Durbin 
  Sheldon Whitehouse

WHITEHOUSE: AMERICA HAS CALLED ON PRESIDENT TO BRING TROOPS HOME
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made the following remarks on the Senate floor this morning. The following is as delivered:
   Mr. President, the American people have demanded a new direction in Iraq, and the momentum building toward that change is strong. It is not difficult to understand why. 
   More than 3,600 brave American troops have lost their lives. Tens of thousands have returned home gravely injured - gravely injured. The war now costs Americans $10 billion every month in Iraq, with total spending now exceeding that of the Vietnam war. It has ruined our international standing. 
   Despite all this, little has changed on the ground. Violence has worsened. Sectarian fighting goes on virtually unabated, with deadly attacks taking a severe and relentless toll. While courageous Americans die, Iraqi politicians argue and stall.  
   Leaving U.S. troops caught in the morass of Iraq has not made that country more secure and, more important, it does not make our country more secure. To stay President Bush's course will continue to cost our men and women in uniform their lives and their physical and mental health. It will continue to drain our national Treasury and further erode what little good will remains for America around the world. It will leave our military with overstrained troops, overstressed families, and equipment and resources in disrepair. We are breaking our military in Iraq. 
   It is time for a change. The American people know this. Democrats and, to their credit, many Republicans in this Congress know this. Anyone who is listening or looking with clear eyes knows this. Yet after years of misjudgments, years of misleading slogans, years of misplaced priorities, and years of failure, this President still refuses to do what he must do: Change course in Iraq and bring our courageous American troops home. 
   Just the other day, the President reasserted his intention to stay the course, to continue this war indefinitely, an open-ended commitment, a blank check, with no prospects for redeployment or a new direction. Again, President Bush has failed to listen to the millions of Americans who have called on him and who have called on us to bring the war to an end. Enough is enough. It is time for a change. 
   Mr. President, a Member of this body recently said this about our Nation's course in Iraq: 
   In my judgment, the costs and risks of continuing down the current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved. Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting our vital interests over the long-term. 
   I happen to agree with those words spoken by the very distinguished Senator, Richard Lugar of Indiana, but what I like the most about them is the voice of reason and thoughtfulness they impart to this debate. There has been too little of that to date. The questions we face over this war in Iraq are serious questions, and they demand seriousness and reason from those who would grapple with them. Senator Lugar's statement reflects that thoughtfulness, reflects that reason, in the midst of a debate which has all too often been characterized by a lack of those characteristics. 
   Look at this administration, which too often communicates not with reason but with slogans and sound bites: ""Stay the course."" ""Global war on terror."" ""Cut and run."" ""Precipitous withdrawal."" People watching this continuing debate, mark when you hear the phrase ""precipitous withdrawal."" You are hearing the end of reason, and sloganeering. This is no service to the people of our country, not when serious and difficult problems must be solved. Just look where this slogan leadership has gotten us so far. It is a dishonor roll of failure: weapons of mass destruction, nonexistent; occupation planning, incompetence; reconstruction efforts, failed; the strain on our troops and their families, disabling; the treatment of our wounded troops, disgraceful; expenditures, massive; fraud, run rampant; the confidence of the American people, forfeited after cascades of false optimism and phony good news. 
   It is time, as Senator Lugar's words exemplify, to pursue intelligent, thoughtful, and realistic decisions about our course in Iraq, decisions that will protect our national interest. It is time to put the slogans away and thoughtfully extricate ourselves from a disastrous mess. 
   I hope we can take these steps forward in the Senate together. I am encouraged that several Republican friends have stated clearly that they cannot support the President's failed course in Iraq and are seeking real change. 
   As I have said many times in this Chamber, our strategy to effect change in Iraq requires the rapid and responsible redeployment of our troops. As I told the President directly when I met with him several months ago, I see the prospect of U.S. redeployment as the most powerful force at our disposal in this conflict now. That prospect of redeployment of American troops will eliminate the insurgents' argument that America is an occupying army, taking away from them a powerful recruiting tool for militant extremists. It will spur Iraq's political leaders to step forward, to quit slow-walking us through their own civil war and take responsibility for the security and governance of their own country. It will confront neighboring nations with a real impetus to assume more positive roles in assuring the region's stability. It will help restore the faith of the world in the leadership, the integrity, the good judgment, and the good will of our great country. 
   The President's surge plan is not the new direction Americans are calling for. It is a tactic - a tactic that can only be effective as part of a larger coherent strategy. And strategy, in turn, largely depends on whether the overarching dynamic works in America's favor. In this regard, America is presently on the worst possible footing. 
   A redeployment of our troops creates the potential to change this overarching dynamic for the better, freeing us to focus on more effective strategies to counter al-Qaida and to stabilize the region. Iraqi leaders will have to reach compromises with each other because their vision for their country's future will no longer be drawn with a major U.S. military presence in it. In the time it will take to bring our massive deployment of troops home, we can send a clear signal to Iraqi leaders and to Iraq's neighbors that America is standing down and it is time for them to stand up. We can help them do that. 
   This is a critical step, and thoughtful, reasoned, political, and diplomatic leadership will be essential to take advantage of the new dynamic a redeployment offers. I will confess that I am deeply troubled that this administration may not have the credibility it needs to accomplish this difficult task, even if it were of a mind to try. 
   This Congress can help set favorable conditions for executive action. We cannot legislate diligence, we cannot legislate thoughtfulness, we cannot legislate competence, and it is not clear that this administration is viewed as capable of those qualities any longer. It may take new faces and new voices to represent our country credibly in this process. Fortunately, there are many talented and accomplished people in this country whose perspectives and experience can help build America's credibility and prestige around the world. It will be a significant diplomatic challenge, but it presents a significant - perhaps historic - diplomatic opportunity. 
   That executive responsibility - the need to put ourselves in that diplomatic arena -- does not relieve us in the Senate of our duty to continue to press forcefully on behalf of the millions of Americans who demanded a change in Iraq, to apply reason, thought, and our best care and judgment to a problem that has not yielded to sloganeering. We will keep the pressure on this President and his administration, whose inability to admit failure is leading our precious Nation deeper and deeper into disaster in Iraq. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE: BUSH ADMINISTRATION STONEWALLING ON NEGOTIATING POWER FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) today sharply questioned a senior Bush administration official over the administration's opposition to negotiating for lower prescription drug prices under the Medicare Part D program.  
   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Michael O. Leavitt appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, on which Whitehouse sits, to discuss the administration's fiscal year 2008 budget request for federal health care programs. 
   ""As seniors confront skyrocketing prescription drug costs, it's extraordinarily frustrating that the Bush administration is unwilling to pursue the obvious remedy: lower drug prices through negotiation,"" Whitehouse said. 
   A vocal advocate for health care reform, Whitehouse has repeatedly called for Medicare to have the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices. Today, he cited a January report by Families USA showing that prices for the top drugs prescribed for seniors are 58 percent higher in Medicare drug plans than when offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). While the VA is permitted to negotiate with drug companies to get the best price for their beneficiaries, Medicare is prohibited by law from negotiating for lower drug prices under the current Part D program. 
   Whitehouse has heard from many Rhode Island seniors who were confused and frustrated by problems they experienced with Medicare Part D. As of last month, 38,400 seniors in Rhode Island who are eligible for prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D had not yet enrolled, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

WHITEHOUSE URGES SENATE TO PROHIBIT TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged the Senate to pass legislation banning torture. Below are Whitehouse's remarks as delivered.
  Mr. President, today's debate goes to the heart of what our country is, and what we wish it to be. By asking this: will the United States of America condone torture? Is there, at America's heart, a heart of darkness? 
  This authorization bill for America's intelligence community, offers us the opportunity to answer that question decisively. It contains a provision for which I have fought, for my initial amendment in Committee, and which I am proud to support today, that would prohibit members of the intelligence community from using any interrogation technique beyond those authorized in the Army Field Manual.
  By adopting this amendment, the two Intelligence Committees - Congress's experts on these matters - have sent a clear signal to America and to the world: that in this country the rule of law is our strongest bulwark against those who would do us harm. I hope that today, the Senate will have the confidence in our national values to reaffirm that signal, and pass this legislation with the Army Field Manual provision included. 
  Over the past several months, the American people have become all too familiar with the issue of torture. I want to discuss one technique in particular today:
  Waterboarding - or water torture, or the water cure - which dates back to the Spanish Inquisition of the 14th century. Waterboarding was a favorite of torturers, because its' terrible effects could be generated without the visible damage accompanying the rack, the screw, the iron, the whip or the gouge. It could be done over and over and over and over. 
  In the 20th century, waterboarding was done in the Philippines, where colonizers wielded it against indigenous peoples. It's been used in Sri Lanka, in Tunisia, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia - we are in the tradition of Pol Pot - by the French in Algeria, by the Japanese in World War II, and by military dictatorships in Latin America.
  The technique ordinarily involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, heels above head, putting a cloth over his face and pouring water over the cloth to simulate, to create, the feeling of suffocation and drowning. As I said, it leaves no marks on the body, but causes extreme physical and psychological suffering. 
  A French journalist, Henri Alleg, was subjected to this method of interrogation during the struggle for Algerian independence, and he wrote in his 1958 book The Question:
  I tried, by contracting my throat, to take in as little water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in my lungs for as long as I could. But I couldn't hold on for more than a few moments. I had the impression of drowning, and a terrible agony, that of death, took possession of me.
  Waterboarding is associated with criminal, tyrant, and repressive regimes, with rulers who sought from their captives not information but propaganda, meant for broadcast to friends or enemies whether true or false. Regimes that employed the technique of waterboarding generally did not do so to obtain information - rather, to obtain compliance. But no matter the purpose or the reason, its use was, and is, indefensible. 
  Water torture was not unknown to Americans. A 1953 article in the New York Times quotes Lt. Col. William Harrison of the U.S. Air Force, who said he was ""tortured with the 'water treatment' by Communist North Koreans."" In testimony before a U.S. military tribunal, Capt. Chase Jay Nielsen described being waterboarded by his Japanese captors following the 1942 Doolittle raid by U.S. aviators. 
  From all this, America's military knew there was a chance our servicemen and servicewomen could be subjected to water torture. The Defense Department established the SERE program: Survive, Evade, Resist, and Escape, to train select military personnel, who are at high risk of capture by enemy forces or isolation within enemy territory. 
  The program has also subjected certain service personnel to extreme interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, in an effort to prepare them for the worst: the possibility of capture and torture at the hands of a depraved or tyrannical enemy. According to Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor and chief of training at the U.S. Navy SERE school in San Diego: ""[O]ur training was designed to show how an evil totalitarian enemy would use torture at the slightest whim."" 
  Those who have experienced this technique, even at the hands of their own brothers in arms, are unequivocal about its effect. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who underwent waterboarding during SERE training, said this: ""As a human being, fear and helplessness are pretty overwhelming. ... this is not a discussion that Americans should ever be having. It is torture."" And our colleague in this body, Senator John McCain, has said the same.
  Yet it was to this relic of the dungeons of the Inquisition, of the Cambodian Killing Fields, and of the juntas of the southern hemisphere, that the Bush administration turned for guidance. I will speak later of how our Department of Justice came to approve this. But for now, we know just last week, in a stunning public admission, CIA Director General Michael Hayden admitted that the United States waterboarded three detainees following the September 11th attacks. The virus of waterboarding had traveled from tyrant regimes, through the SERE program, and infected America's body politic.
  Retired Brigadier General David Irvin of the U.S. Army Reserve, a former intelligence officer and instructor in interrogation, and Joe Navarro, an interrogator with the FBI, have recently written this:
  [T]here is considerable evidence that the CIA had to scramble after 9/11 to develop an interrogation program and turned to individuals with no professional experience in the field. ... Given the crisis atmosphere of the day, it is all too easy to believe the comment of an intelligence insider who said of the secret program to detain and interrogate al Qaeda suspects that ""quality control went out the window.""
  Don't let us jump out the window after it.
  America's military is expressly prohibited from using torture - because intelligence experts in our armed forces know that torture is an ineffective method of obtaining actionable intelligence. 
  Again I will speak later about the false assertion that this program was designed for eighteen year old novices. Some of the most sophisticated intelligence interrogations are done by our military after intense training. And, our military adheres to the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. At a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which I serve, I asked Col. Steven Kleinman, a 22-year veteran of interrogations, a senior intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserves and a veteran interrogator with plenty of experience overseas in the Middle East, about his experience conducting interrogations using the Army Field Manual. He said this: 
  I am not at all limited by the Army Field Manual in terms of what I need to do to generate useful information. ... I've never felt any necessity or operational requirement to bring physical, psychological or emotional pressure on a source to win their cooperation.
  A significant number of retired military leaders have written to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee saying:
  Interrogation methods authorized by the Field Manual have proven effective in eliciting vital intelligence from dangerous enemy prisoners. ... And the principles reflected in the Field Manual are values that no, no U.S. agency should violate.
  And General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces serving in Iraq, reiterated this point when he wrote last year to every soldier serving in the Iraq theater:
  Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. ...our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual, [section] (2-22.3) on Human Intelligence Collector Operations that was published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.
  That is the end of General Petraeus's quote.
  The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission emphatically agree. On Monday the chairmen, together with two former Secretaries of State, three former National Security Advisors and other national security experts, wrote that ""[c]ruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners under American control makes us less safe, violates our nation's values, and damages America's reputation in the world.""
  Torture is ineffective, it's wrong, and it's dangerous to all those who serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever be used by any person who represents the United States of America, or any agency that flies the American flag. 
  I was proud, last July, to introduce an amendment in the Intelligence Committee that would write this rule into law, and when that effort did not succeed, I was proud again, last winter, to support Senator Feinstein's amendment in conference. 
  I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation. We can journey no longer down Winston Churchill's ""stairway which leads to a dark gulf."" As Winston Churchill said, ""It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on there are only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your feet.""
  The United States of America - the city on a hill, the light of the world, the promise of generations - must not ever condone torture. Torture breaks that promise, torture extinguishes that light, torture darkens that city. I hope that by our actions today, we in the Senate will help turn this country back toward our centuries-old promise. I hope we will turn towards the light. 
  I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE CRITICIZES JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ADVICE CONDONING TORTURE
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse yesterday decried a decision by the Department of Justice to advise the CIA that the interrogation technique called ""waterboarding"" is legal, despite significant precedent in U.S. law showing the government had long considered the practice to be illegal.Below are Whitehouse's remarks as delivered.
   Mr. President, I want to follow the lead of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and my friend, the Senator from Illinois, and continue on this question with the determination the Government has made that waterboarding is legal.
   It is a question that matters so much to wary and watchful nations, disheartened and distrustful in the wake of 7 years of failed leadership and broken promises. It is also a question that matters immensely to the billions of men, women, and children around the globe who look to this country, the United States of America, as a beacon of light that shows the way nations ought to act and the way the world ought to be. It is a question that matters to the American people who are sick of asking: Is it wrong? and being told: Well, it depends. 
   The people of America still do not know how this came about-in particular, how the Department of Justice came to approve this sordid technique. I believe we are in a position where the concerns we have about torture overlap with some of the concerns we have had in this Chamber about the independence and integrity of the Department of Justice. Here is what we know.
   We know that Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said that ""the CIA sought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department informed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the circumstances and within the limits and safeguards of the program."" We know in 2002, John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel drafted a memo, later approved by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, which reads, in part:
   There is a significant range of acts that, though they might constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, failed to rise to the level of torture.
   As Evan Wallach of the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law has written:
   None of the Memo's analysis explains why waterboarding does not cause physical or psychological pain sufficient to meet the criminalization standards it enunciates.
   We have asked for further clarification, but in a hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Mukasey refused to comment on the legality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in use and because of what he described as ""the absence of concrete facts and circumstances."" Even though the Department of Justice is now conducting an investigation into whether tape recordings of alleged waterboarding sessions were improperly destroyed, they would not look into whether the conduct on the tape was in and of itself improper.
   The argument is that no one who relies in good faith on the Department's past advice should be subject to criminal investigations for actions taken in reliance on that advice, which raises the question within the question: How did that advice come to be given in the first place?
   How did the best and brightest of the Department of Justice overlook the facts of the history of waterboarding prosecutions in which the United States was directly involved, and why was such guidance approved when contravening precedents appear clearly to be in evidence?
   Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the article written by Evan Wallach, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, entitled ""Drop by Drop: Forgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts."" The full cite is 45 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 468 (2007).
   Mr. President, the U.S. Government long considered waterboarding a form of torture, prosecutable as a war crime and punishable accordingly. This history includes war crimes prosecutions against Japanese soldiers who water boarded American aviators in World War II, the use of water torture by U.S. soldiers in the Philippines, and even an incident of waterboarding by a local sheriff prosecuted by the Department of Justice itself. Let me start with that.
   I am reading from the Wallach law review article in which it reports:
   In 1983, the Department of Justice affirmed that the use of water torture techniques was indeed criminal conduct under U.S. law.
   A sheriff in a Texas county waterboarded prisoners in order to extract confessions. Count one of the indictment asserted that the defendants conspired to-and this is a quote from the Department's own indictment - ""subject prisoners to a suffocating 'water torture' ordeal in order to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise indicate he was suffocating and/or drowning.""
   The sheriff and his deputies were all convicted by a jury under count one. It didn't end there. The case then went up on appeal, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a decision. I have in my hands United States of America v. Lee, 744 F.2d 1124, decided in 1984, in which they gave appellate review of these convictions.
   Finally, at sentencing, U.S. District Judge James DeAnda's comments, according to the article, were ""He told the former Sheriff that he had allowed law enforcement to fall into 'the hands of a bunch of thugs. The operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country.'"" That is the opinion of a U.S. district court judge at a sentencing on waterboarding.
   How is it that when the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel, were asked for their opinion, they were able to write this opinion? I have it in my hand. This is the unclassified version. It has been substantially redacted. Even so, it is 50 pages long - 50 pages long. They did 50 pages of legal research and could not find a U.S. Court of Appeals case in which the Department of Justice itself had brought the charges? Here is the case, United States v. Lee. It describes the facts:
   Lee was indicted along with two other deputies, Floyd Baker and James Glover, and the County Sheriff James Parker, based on a number of incidents in which prisoners were subjected to a ""water torture"" in order to prompt confessions to various crimes. 
  Throughout the rest of the opinion, these are referred to as ""torture"" and ""torture incidents.""
   All one has to have is Lexus or Westlaw and plug in the words ""water torture"" and find this case. How is it possible that the Office of Legal Counsel could not have found this? How is it possible that they could have also missed what the Columbia Law School was able to find - a telegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the Japanese Government objecting to the mistreatment of American prisoners, which included specifically waterboarding and describing the ""brutal and bestial methods of extorting alleged confessions""? That is our Secretary of State in an official communication to the Japanese Government describing, among other tortures, water tortures as brutal and bestial methods to extort alleged confessions. How could they not have found that? How could they not have found the charges the Senator from North Dakota referred to in which Japanese soldiers were brought up on charges in front of military tribunals-military tribunals staffed with American judges, military tribunals staffed with American prosecutors - for waterboarding American prisoners?
   Here are some examples. One of the Japanese officers was named Hata and the article describes the charges and specifications against Officer Hata, which included this:
   ... Hata did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils.
   Similarly, Hata did willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O. Cash and Monroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. .....
   The charge and specifications against Officer Asano were:
   Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils. .....
   Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O Cash and Munroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. .....
   The charge and specifications against Officer Kita were again, ""willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture John Henry Burton, an American Prisoner of War, by beating him and by forcing water into his nose.""
   Over and over the testimony describes exactly what we know as waterboarding. The charges and specifications by this tribunal staffed by American officers describe that they did willfully and unlawfully commit cruel, inhuman, and brutal acts and atrocities and other offenses, including strapping them to a stretcher and pouring water down their nostrils, by holding the prisoner's head back and forcing him to swallow a bucketful of sea water over and over and over.
   How could they have missed it? How could they have missed it? How could they miss the decision on point by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit?
   What else do we know about the Office of Legal Counsel? We know that the conditions there were pretty ripe for abuse. We know they were doing this in secret, protected from public scrutiny, protected from peer review, protected from critical analysis under the veil of secrecy, deep secrecy in which they were operating, coming up with the theories as they pleased, thinking they would never see the light of day. So they did not have to do their homework. Somebody might have done a little research and found the Fifth Circuit decision on point, but, no, they did not need to.
   It is part of a pattern because, as the Presiding Officer will recall, when I was offered the chance to read the secret Office of Legal Counsel opinions related to the warrantless wiretapping program, I went and took some notes, and when I got back here, I eventually was able to get them declassified. They described other interesting theories that grew in that hothouse of legal ideology, protected from the glare of public scrutiny, ideas such as the President is not obliged to follow Executive orders. He is not obliged to give anybody notice that he is violating Executive orders. He can live in a parallel universe in constant violation of his own Executive orders and nothing is wrong with that, other than, of course, the fact that it completely degrades and destroys the entire structure of Executive orders as a law function of the United States of America.
   Another argument is that under article II, the President's power as Commander in Chief, he has the authority to determine what his powers are. Think about that for a moment. They assert article II gives them the authority to decide what the scope of his article II powers are. I seem to remember a decision called Marbury v. Madison saying it is ""emphatically the province of the judicial department to decide what the law is.""
   The last one, my personal favorite, is that the Department of Justice is bound by the legal determinations of the President. It is a good thing that was not the case when President Nixon was the President and made the legal determination if the President does it, it doesn't violate the law.
   So what on Earth has been going on at the Office of Legal Counsel, an office that used to be distinguished for its probity, for its analysis, for its scholarship, an office on which the Department of Justice relies?
   Just as Americans rely on the Department of Justice to provide guidance in our Government, to provide a moral compass within the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be the place where they try to get it right. How could they try to get it right when they cannot even find a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on water torture when you are looking up whether it is illegal? If I were a partner in a law firm and a junior associate came to me with a memo such as this that had missed the case on point, do you think he would have much of a career? I don't think so. It is a fatal failure of legal analysis. And yet, where there is supposed to be the very best at the legal counsel of the Department of Justice, they missed all of it. If there has been a systematic breakdown in this institution of Government long known for probity and scholarship, if it has been captured and behind a veil of secrecy rendered a political ideological tool, that is a matter of very legitimate public concern.
   I am pleased to say Senator Durbin and myself have written to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice and to the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice to look into exactly that matter.
   I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience with me. I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for his patience.
   I yield the floor.

WHITEHOUSE
  The U.S. Senate today passed legislation banning the use of torture by U.S. interrogators, a measure cosponsored by U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, fought to include the provision in the House-Senate conference report, and praised today's vote as a clear sign that ""the strength of America is the force of its ideals."" 
  ""Torture is ineffective, unnecessary, andwrong, and it's dangerous to all those who serve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever be used by any person who represents this country, or any agency that flies our flag, and this vote should ensure that it never will be,"" Whitehouse said. ""Now, President Bush must stand with us, and not with the torturers of the Khmer Rouge or the Inquisitors of Spain. I hope the President will sign this legislation and commit his administration to follow it.""
  Last week, General Michael Hayden, director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), publicly admitted for the first time that the CIA had waterboarded three detainees while in U.S. custody. Waterboarding, or water torture, involves strapping a captive in a reclining position, putting a cloth over his face and pouring water over the cloth to create the feeling of suffocation and drowning. The technique causes extreme physical and psychological suffering and has been recognized as illegal torture by a number of U.S. courts and military tribunals, as well as under international law. 
  Despite this precedent, Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said the Department of Justice provided legal guidance to the CIA indicating that the use of waterboarding would be lawful. Mukasey has refused to comment on the legality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in use, and because of what he described as ""the absence of concrete facts and circumstances."" 
  Whitehouse was the principal sponsor of an amendment prohibiting torture in July, as part of legislation authorizing funding and setting policy for the CIA and other branches of the intelligence community. When that amendment failed in the Senate Intelligence Committee, Whitehouse joined Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and several others to try to add the amendment during House-Senate conference negotiations on the bill last December. That time, it passed, with the support of Congressman Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate voted today to approve the conference report; the House took a similar vote late last year.

WHITEHOUSE APPLAUDS ENACTMENT OF AID TO SENIORS
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement today on economic stimulus legislation that will provide $300-$600 in rebates to most households, including seniors living on Social Security. President Bush signed the bill into law this afternoon. 
  ""The economic stimulus bill signed by the President today will provide badly-needed help to hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders - people who, in tough economic times, have stretched their budgets to pay for gas, for home heating oil, for groceries, or for mortgage or rent payments. I'm pleased that this bill also includes assistance for the many seniors in our state who live on Social Security, and who were excluded from President Bush's original proposal.
  ""I'm going to monitor this process closely to help make sure seniors in our state have all the information they need to take advantage of this badly-needed help. Because for the thousands of Rhode Island seniors struggling every day just to get by, a little breathing room can make an enormous difference.""
  Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, wrote Senate leaders in January to push for the inclusion of seniors who rely on Social Security benefits in the stimulus package. Congress passed the measure last week.

SNOWE URGES CONGRESS TO TAKE UP PASSENGER BILL OF RIGHTS
  Following a recent decision by a federal appeals court that the federal government, not the state, has authority over airlines, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, was joined by Sen. Barbara Boxer (R-Cali.) and passenger rights advocate Katie Hanni today to stress the urgent need for Congress to act on Passenger Bill of Right's legislation (S. 678) she introduced with Senator Barbara Boxer (R-CA) in February of 2006. 
   ""It was the outrageous delays at JFK Airport in New York in February 2007 and Katie's own traumatic experience in 2006, when she was stuck on the Austin tarmac for more than 9 hours without food or water, that first triggered calls for congressional action and for the enactment of a Passenger Bill of Rights,"" Senator Snowe recalled. ""Yet here we are more than a year later and Congress continues to drag its feet on this critical issue even as passenger satisfaction with the airlines continues to worsen.""
   ""More than a year ago, Senator Boxer and I introduced the Passenger Bill of Rights, and like all traveling Americans, we are still waiting for the Senate to act on this legislation as our bill languishes in the FAA Reauthorization,"" said Senator Snowe. ""Congress has a responsibility to the American people to ensure there is some level of accountability, some minimum standard in place. If a patron visits a restaurant that does not offer some modicum of functioning restrooms or provide adequate food and water, that customer can leave the restaurant and find another. For the airline passenger, that simply is not an option.""
   The Senate Commerce Committee passed the Boxer-Snowe Airline Passengers Bill of Rights as part of the FAA Reauthorization Bill in May 2007. The legislation ensures that travelers are not unnecessarily trapped on airplanes or deprived of food, potable water or adequate restroom facilities. The language included by the Committee also requires air carriers to develop and submit to the Secretary of Transportation their own plan, incorporating medical considerations, to ensure that passengers are provided a clear timeframe under which they will be permitted to deplane a delayed aircraft. The Secretary would be required to make the plans available to the public. In the absence of such a plan, passengers would have the option of safely deplaning a grounded aircraft three hours after the plane door has closed. This option would be provided every three hours that the plane continues to sit on the ground.

SNOWE AMENDMENT TO BOLSTER STATE'S SHARE OF HOUSING PROGRAM FUNDING PASSES SENATE
  An amendment introduced by U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) was accepted as a part of the housing stimulus legislation passed today by the Senate. Her amendment would provide small states like Maine with an increased share of the additional Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program funding authorized in the housing stimulus legislation. MRBs are tax-exempt bonds that help fund below-market-interest-rate mortgages for first-time qualifying homebuyers. The allocation and distribution of MRBs are based on population - meaning larger populous areas receive a greater percentage of MRB funding. The program does have a small state funding block to ensure smaller states receive access to the MRBs. 
   The Senate's housing stimulus legislation provides an additional $10 billion in MRB's for first-time homebuyers and at-risk borrowers. This package is allocated only based on state populations. The accepted Snowe amendment provides an additional $930 million of MRBs in order to ""true up"" the amount small states would have otherwise received if there had been a $10 billion allocation with a small state minimum. Maine goes from receiving $43 million to $90 million - an increase of 110 percent.
   ""Americans throughout the country have been adversely impacted by the economic downturn and the housing crisis, so our efforts to curtail these problems must be as widespread and definitive as possible,"" Sen. Snowe said. ""For Maine, passage of this amendment would result in a 110% increase in the state's additional MRB allocation. While this amendment represents a very small portion of the bill's overall funding, its effects to states like Maine is pretty substantial.""

SNOWE URGES RELEASE OF PORTION OF STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE TO COMBAT HIGH GAS PRICES
  Today, Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) issued the following statement calling for the release of a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to combat the spike in gas and oil prices that has been caused by the closure of the British Petroleum pipeline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska two days ago:  
   With the tight global supply of oil made even tighter by BP's shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, skyrocketing demand and an increasingly insecure world, there is no question that our nation is experiencing an energy crisis. Accordingly, I believe the President should release a commensurate portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counteract this latest disruption in supply that is affecting our entire nation. This is an appropriate short-term response to combat a dangerous spike in oil and gas prices that could well impact our economic growth - disproportionately affecting our most vulnerable citizens. 
  The shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay operation represents a significant decrease in supply - roughly 8 percent of America's crude oil production. This latest disruption, coupled with world events, has pushed the price of oil close to the inflation adjusted record high of $85 dollars a barrel. And it is without question that these high energy costs have an effect on our economy and must be swiftly addressed.
  The economic ripple effect of high gasoline and energy prices is most acutely felt by our country's rural communities and poorest families. Traveling throughout Maine, I have heard from countless Mainers who are struggling to cope with these current prices that could reach $3.30 a gallon. As a nation we must act - and we can act by releasing a proportionate amount of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help Americans through these difficult times.

SNOWE, ROCKEFELLER: SENATE PASSAGE OF TELECOM LEGISLATION GOOD NEWS FOR ALL AMERICANS
  Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV) today praised a Congressional compromise that brought about last-minute passage of three key pieces of telecommunications legislation as the Senate adjourned for the year. The legislation that passed the Senate last night by unanimous consent includes the Universal Service Fund bill that Sens. Snowe and Rockefeller authored, the Spectrum Relocation bill, and the Enhanced 911 (E-911) bill.  
   ""Last night, the Senate put politics aside in passing legislation to help schools and libraries around the country to stay connected Internet service while preventing potential increases in consumer and business phone bill fees. This bipartisan bill ensures that until a permanent fix is crafted, the status quo is preserved allowing schools and libraries to receive their Internet funding, and keeping consumers' telephone bills from rising,"" said Snowe. ""Over the course of the 108th Congress, my colleagues and I on the Commerce Committee have worked tirelessly to enact these three critical pieces of telecommunications legislation. I am pleased that all sides through hard work and determination were able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement and get these bills passed into law."" 
   ""Legislators from both sides of the aisle and from both houses of Congress came together to pass this important legislation,"" Rockefeller said. ""We know how important it is that our schools, libraries, and telephone consumers continue to have the communications services they need at a reasonable price. E-Rate, in particular, has been a wonderful success story because it has fundamentally transformed education in this country. I applaud everyone's effort to reach an agreement, and I look forward to a more permanent solution in the next Congress."" 
   More than $400 million in Universal Service Fund (USF) requests from schools and libraries have not yet been met because new Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-imposed accounting rules drastically limit the amount of funding for these programs. Without passage of this legislation, the FCC would have been forced to increase contributions to USF to meet all of the fund's commitments. That would have meant an increase in telephone fees to all residential and business customers beginning in January. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller's legislation would exempt USF from the Anti-Deficiency Act for one year. Under the exemption, E-Rate could continue issue commitment letters based on future revenue, not according to the cash-on-hand rules that the FCC began demanding in August. A more permanent fix for the program would be considered during the 109th Congress. 
   The USF suspension has delayed more than 4000 school systems' requests for E-Rate funding. 
   Snowe and Rockefeller created E-Rate as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. In 1996, only 3% of America's schools and libraries had Internet access. As of 2002, 92% were wired. A recent Government Accountability Office report showed that rural school systems, which have been particularly hard hit by the lack of funding, have used E-Rate to meet No Child Left Behind accountability mandates. 
   Also included in this package are two bills that enjoy broad support in Congress and which Snowe and Rockefeller have supported as members of the Senate Commerce Committee. Passage of the Spectrum Relocation bill will open up large amounts of radio frequencies currently used by the government for use by wireless telephone companies, Internet service providers, and public safety agencies. The bill would compensate these agencies for the costs they incur in moving to alternate frequencies by using proceeds from the auction of spectrum by the FCC to private companies. 
   The E-911 bill would ensure that fees assessed on telephone customers' bills for the purpose of funding improvements in local 911 emergency services is used by states and localities for that purpose alone - and not diverted to other uses. The legislation also provides for grants to state and local governments for enhancing emergency communication services. One of the key aims of this bill is to enable emergency responders to locate those placing 911 calls on cell phones. Currently, only land line callers can be immediately located. 
   The U.S. House of Representatives passed the same legislation in November of this year.

SNOWE LEADS DISCUSSIONS WITH PENTAGON ON ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT RESERVE CENTER AT BRUNSWICK
  Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) this morning called Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Mr. Thomas Hall, regarding the establishment of a Joint Reserve Center at Brunswick Naval Air Station (BNAS).Sen. Snowe express her support of the Center that has been proposed by General John Libby, the State's Adjutant General.  
   ""This morning, I spoke with Assistant Secretary of Defense Thomas Hall to discuss establishing a Joint Reserve Center at BNAS. I believe that a Reserve Center at Brunswick would not only be good for the facility and the surrounding community, but for the safety and protection of the region and, indeed, the nation. A joint reserve center at Brunswick Naval Air Station will ensure that reserve units from the different branches of the military have the flexibility to come together for improved coordination and training that is so necessary in this post 9-11 world,"" said Snowe. 
   ""The genesis of this Center is General Libby's - and I believe it demonstrates the irreplaceable current and future role of BNAS. I believe Secretary Hall was receptive to the idea and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future,"" said Snowe. 
   During this morning's call, Snowe and Hall discussed the unique strategic location and capabilities offered by BNAS. Brunswick NAS has played a role in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, both as a home to deployed squadrons as well as host to outbound and inbound aircraft and personnel; acts as the premier site for maritime patrol training and operations; and supports NATO, the Naval Reserve and nearby Naval activities, such as SUPSHIPS Bath and Bath Iron Works. 
   Next week, Secretary Hall's staff will brief Maine's congressional delegation staff on the Joint Reserve Centers.

   ""It is vital that we give our children the tools necessary to succeed,"" Rockefeller said, ""Providing our schools with computers ensures that young West Virginians will have access to the world of information offered by the Internet. This investment is critical because students with access to technology will be the high-tech workers of tomorrow.""
   The West Virginia institutions receiving the computers are the Wirt County High School in Elizabeth, the Mingo County Schools, the Calhoun County Schools, the McDowell County Schools, and the Pendelton County Schools. 
   The computers, which were divided equally among the five recipients, were made available through the Senate's Computers for Schools Program. Senate officials established the program to help public schools take advantage of information technology by providing them with surplus computers.
   Rockefeller has been recognized nationally for his education technology work. Technology & Learning recently honored Rockefeller and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) as part of the ""5 That Made Their Mark"" for their creation of the landmark 1996 E-Rate program, which over the last decade has provided Internet connections to tens of thousands of American schools and libraries.

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES WHITE HOUSE, PENTAGON TO SAVE LOCKHEED MARTIN JOBS IN CLARKSBURG
  To ensure that the U.S. military has maximum transport capability and to protect West Virginia jobs, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) joined 18 other Senators today in a bi-partisan letter to President George W. Bush, urging reconsideration of plans to end the C-130J contract in the FY2006 budget. Approximately 80 jobs at Lockheed Martin's Clarksburg plant depend on completing the multi-year contract for 62 C-130J planes. 
   ""At a time when we are trying to improve the readiness and effectiveness of our military forces, eliminating the C-130J contract doesn't make sense,"" Rockefeller said. ""The C-130 transport plane has been reliable, but military modernization is an ongoing process. We need a new version of this proven aircraft. The C-130J will provide that.
   ""The President should realize that eliminating the C-130J could harm our nation's defense - and hurt West Virginia workers, as well as American workers elsewhere. The White House should reconsider the Pentagon decision.""
   Workers at Clarksburg's Lockheed Martin plant build components for the C-130J, an updated version of the C-130. The C-130 transport plane has been the workhorse of the military fleet for more than 50 years, but is aging. Currently, more than half of the C-130 fleet is 30 years old or older. Without the C-130J, the Air Force will be 116 aircraft short of meeting modernization requirements, and the Marine Corps will be 18 aircraft short. 
   Reports suggest that canceling the C-130J program will result in savings of $26 million next year. But without the new planes, the military will spend over $800 million in termination liability costs and millions of dollars in increased costs to maintain outdated aircraft. As a result, the proposal to end the C-130J program could end up costing American taxpayers far more than the cost of completing the contract for the C-130Js - besides the costs of lost jobs.
   West Virginia Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) also signed the letter.

ROCKEFELLER, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS CALL FOR SERIES OF HEARINGS ON COAL MINE SAFETY
  Following last week's tragic mining accident at Sago, West Virginia, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-WV), along with a bipartisan group of eleven Coal State Senators, today requested the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee to hold a series of hearings specifically dedicated to the issue of coal mine safety. Congress has conducted no comprehensive oversight hearings of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) since 2001. During that period, which has seen more than 100 deaths in mine workplace accidents, MSHA has struggled with severe budget cuts and a wave of planned retirements. Among other issues, Rockefeller and his colleagues want the hearings to address MSHA funding, the crisis in the number of MSHA inspectors, and the shortage of mine rescue units. 
   ""This last week has been a real wakeup call for people all over America that we need to do more - much more - to take care of those people who on a daily basis are risking their lives to bring electricity to our homes, schools, and businesses,"" Rockefeller said. ""We need to know why the administration thinks that it can carry out a policy where it is committing fewer and fewer resources to meet an industry that has more and more needs. 
   ""We need congressional hearings not only so that we can determine what happened at Sago, but, more broadly, about the state of mine safety across West Virginia and across the country. Coal is on the rise in our country and safety must be too."" 
   In their letter to HELP Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) and Ranking Democratic Member Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), the Senators wrote, ""We make this request while the tragedy of last week's Sago Mine disaster is fresh in the minds and hearts of us all. We know that miners, retirees, and their families throughout the country are well aware of the risks inherent in working in even the safest mines, but we must work to minimize those risks so that such a tragedy never occurs again. For those of us from coal mining states, and for the people we represent, these twelve miners lost in Upshur County, West Virginia are very much tragedies in our own communities. We know too that all Americans who followed this unfolding catastrophe join us in seeking answers, and in wanting Congress to act in a bipartisan fashion to prevent similar calamities in the future.
   ""Each of us looks forward to the opportunity to work together with the Chairman and Ranking Member to improve mine safety. We anxiously await and will closely monitor the MSHA investigation at Sago Mine. At the same time, with demand for coal increasing, we hope with the cooperation of the HELP Committee and experts from government, industry, labor, and worker safety organizations, to develop policies to benefit the entire coal mining community. We look forward to sending strong, bipartisan mine safety legislation to the President for his signature before the end of the year. The miners who died at Sago deserve no less."" 
   During four of the last five years, the administration has called for a reduction in the MSHA budget. According to one report, the cuts have led to the loss of 170 inspectors, even though demand for coal is growing. By the end of FY 2007, a full 25 percent of the MSHA inspector workforce will have retired. 
   Rockefeller has also talked with several of his Senate colleagues about traveling with him to Sago to learn more about the situation in West Virginia. 
   Signing Rockefeller's letter were Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV), Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA), Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL), Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN), Senator Barack Obama (D-IL), Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY), Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN).

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES FOR AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR WEST VIRGINIA SENIORS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who has long fought to lower the cost of prescription drugs, today pushed for the Medicare prescription drug program to be able to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Sen. Rockefeller noted the importance of price negotiation for seniors, particularly those on fixed incomes.   
   ""For the seniors in West Virginia, prescription drug affordability is not a political issue, it is an issue of survival,"" said Rockefeller. ""And for many seniors in our state, especially those who struggle financially, Medicare's current prescription drug program is simply not meeting their needs."" 
   Current Medicare law expressly prohibits the federal government from negotiating with drug companies to lower prescription drug prices, and Senator Rockefeller believes that the federal government should have the opportunity to get the best deal possible for seniors.  
   ""The 43 million people who participate in the Medicare program depend on the federal government to seek the lowest prices possible and to get the most for their hard-earned dollars,"" Rockefeller said.  
   Senator Rockefeller, the new Chairman of the Finance Health Care Subcommittee, has been a long-time advocate of protecting seniors from high prescription drug costs. He believes that government price negotiation will be an important tool in reducing overall costs.  
   ""Price negotiation has been enormously successful for the Department of Veterans Affairs and state Medicaid programs,"" said Rockefeller. ""And if price negotiation can help to shield our seniors from the costs they struggle to pay, then we must do everything in our power to help them.""

ROCKEFELLER PUSHES FOR MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE THAT WOULD AFFECT 133,000 WEST VIRGINIA WORKERS
  Sen. Jay Rockefeller today called on the Senate to pass a minimum wage increase bill that would immediately benefit 59,000 West Virginia workers who currently earn the minimum wage. The bill would affect a total of 133,000 workers in the state when fully phased-in in two years. A long-time champion for working West Virginians, Sen. Rockefeller underscored the significant impact an increase would have.   
   ""Raising the minimum wage would have an enormous effect in West Virginia,"" said Rockefeller. ""For many of these workers, who are the primary breadwinners in their families, this would truly mean a better quality of life."" 
   Senator Rockefeller attended a committee hearing yesterday that reviewed the impact of increasing the minimum wage, and possible tax benefits to help offset any adverse effects on small businesses.  
   ""Raising the minimum wage is terribly important - and we have to get it done,"" said Rockefeller. ""We may also be able to provide small businesses with some assistance to offset any potential effect of the increase."" 
   While the federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour has not had an increase in nearly a decade, the House voted yesterday to raise the minimum wage incrementally to $7.25 an hour over the next two years. Senator Rockefeller has voted to increase the federal minimum wage at least eight times since 1998, and he plans to vote for it again when the issue comes up for debate in the Senate. 
   ""When the minimum wage was first enacted, the goal was to provide workers with wages on which they could live and support their families,"" said Rockefeller. ""Families simply cannot live on the current minimum wage - and now is the time for Congress to take action on an increase that is long overdue.""

   ""It is an approach that tinkers at the margins of a grave and deteriorating situation. It is not grounded in the realities we face in Iraq and in the region, and it is an unacceptable gamble with additional soldiers' lives.

Olympia Snowe (R-ME) were hailed for their creation of the landmark 1996 E-Rate program, which over the last decade has provided Internet connections to tens of thousands of American schools and libraries.  
   The magazine included Rockefeller and Snowe (R-ME) as #4 on the list. Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are #2 on the list, and Bill Gates is #3. According to Technology & Learning, Gates, Rockefeller, and the others on the list have introduced ""products and initiatives that have shaped the landscape of education technology over the past generation."" 
   ""Being mentioned in the same list as technology giants Bill Gates and Steve Jobs is really an honor,"" said Rockefeller. ""Regardless of the particular direction we've taken to improve education technology, all of us have shared the same goal of advancing education technology because we know how important it is that our schools and libraries have the resources they need to educate our students and prepare them to compete for the jobs of the future. 
   ""E-Rate, in particular, has been a vital part of providing this gateway to technology, particularly in rural areas such as those that make up much of West Virginia. E-Rate has been the great equalizer. It has made sure that, no matter where people live or what the resources of their school are, no child will be left behind."" 
   E-Rate provides deep discounts to schools and libraries in West Virginia and throughout the nation for telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections for the classroom. Its record has been remarkable. In 1994, only 3 percent of classrooms nationwide were online. Today, almost 90 percent of classrooms nationwide, including 85 percent in West Virginia, are wired to the Internet because of E-Rate funding.

SALAZAR PUSHES FOR SECURE BORDER
  As the Senate begins debate on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, Sen. Ken Salazar moved today to secure the border by supporting an amendment to criminalize the construction of unauthorized tunnels under U.S. borders.
   ""Our Nation's borders are broken and lawless. Even before September 11, Border Patrol agents discovered two underground tunnels used to transport illegal drugs across the border. Now, with the very real threats of terrorism and human trafficking looming large, reports of underground tunnels are troubling for law enforcement and humanitarian workers alike. Without a secure border, our National Security remains at risk,"" said Senator Salazar, a former Colorado Attorney General. 
   The ""Border Tunnel Prevention Act,"" which Senator Salazar cosponsored as an amendment today, punishes the construction of unauthorized tunnels with a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. In addition, the legislation punishes those who permit others to construct tunnels with a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.
   Also today, in a press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Senator Salazar emphasized that border security is an integral facet of any comprehensive approach to addressing illegal immigration and America's National Security. Senator Salazar noted that Democrats have offered a wide array of amendments that would have provided $3.4 billion in border security funds since 2001 and that the Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform act adds thousands of new personnel to help secure our porous borders. 
   ""Congress is ready to address this National Security issue,"" Senator Salazar said today. ""Hopefully, this week we can begin to address this issue in a reasonable and appropriate manner. Hopefully we can begin to bring law and order to our porous borders. Hopefully we can convince our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the National Security of the Nation is too important to play politics with.""
   Senator Salazar's complete remarks as prepared follow:
   ""Our Nation is embroiled in a debate of epic proportions - border security and the reality of illegal immigration. The reality is that our borders are broken and lawless. In the past two decades the number of undocumented immigrants living here has tripled to nearly 12 million.
   ""The fact that the federal government has permitted millions to cross our borders illegally, with no idea who is entering and for what purpose, is unacceptable. Enforcement of our immigration laws has not kept pace with the flow of both legal and illegal immigration, and laws that deal with those who crossed the border are rarely enforced.
   ""There has been a lot of tough talk of late about fixing our broken borders; unfortunately talking about the problem for political gain won't fix anything.
   ""Since 2001, the number of illegal border crossers apprehended annually has dropped 30 percent. The 9/11 Act authorized new facilities to hold an additional 8,000 individuals detained for illegally crossing our border each year for the next five years. In contrast, in FY06, Congress funded only 1,800 additional detention beds. Today, our border control agents can only handle 10 percent of illegal border crossers under current staffing conditions.
   ""The 9/11 Act also mandated an additional 800 immigration enforcement agents for each of the next five years. For Fiscal Year 2006, Congress funded only 350 additional agents. And again, in next year's budget, the Administration funds 85 fewer agents than authorized. 
   ""The GAO released a report in March that detailed how two federal investigators were able to smuggle enough nuclear material to make two dirty bombs across our northern and southern borders. The report stated that GAO investigators 'transported radioactive sources across both borders?with ease.' 
   ""While House Republican leadership mulls over politically-motivated hearings in swing districts, the rest of us are seeking a solution. 
   ""Since 9/11, Democrats have proposed amendments and legislative initiatives that would have provided an additional $3.4 billion in border security funds.
   ""The comprehensive immigration reform backed by a bipartisan majority of Senators includes hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of new positions aimed at fixing our lawless borders. For example, that bill would add 12,000 new Border Patrol agents, 10,000 new ICE worksite inspectors, 2,500 new port-of-entry inspectors, 1,000 new document fraud inspectors, and hundreds of other positions. 
   ""Between proposals offered by Democrats in both chambers and comprehensive immigration reform which provides for border security and immigration law enforcement, Congress is ready to address this National Security issue. 
   ""Hopefully, this week we can begin to address this issue in a reasonable and appropriate manner. Hopefully we can begin to bring law and order to our porous borders. Hopefully we can convince our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the National Security of the Nation is too important to play politics with.""

ROCKEFELLER FIGHTS AGAINST REPUBLICAN SMALL BUSINESS BILL
  The Senate today moved toward a vote on a Republican small business health coverage bill that would undermine state-enacted consumer protections for an estimated 393,000 West Virginians. The Republican bill would leave it up to insurance companies to determine what would be covered and would leave it up to the companies to set their own rates. Under that bill, West Virginians would likely see a reduction in access to essential health care services, including treatment for alcoholism, cervical cancer screening, colorectal screening, mammography screening, home health care, mental health services, well child care, and supplies for diabetics. 
   ""Providing greater access to health insurance for our small business owners and employees is absolutely critical,"" said Rockefeller. ""But we should do this in a way that actually helps small businesses and employees. The Republican bill would ignore critical protections that West Virginia has enacted at the state level. It would create a system that would keep West Virginians from getting many of the basic health care services that they need. Unfortunately, the bill that they're trying to pass would hurt the businesses and employees it is supposed to help."" 
   Rockefeller and most Democrats support another bill, the Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act, but Republicans have blocked efforts to bring this bill up for a vote. The bill's Small Employers Health Benefits Program (SEHBP) is modeled after the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which has offered more than eight million government employees and retirees a wide range of private health insurance choices for more than 40 years. SEHBP would give small business employees access to a comparable range of private health plans. 
   ""So many West Virginians have told me that, due to the high cost of insurance, their employers haven't been able to provide them with the coverage they need. Passing the Small Employers Health Benefits Program Act would mean that West Virginians will have access to high-quality, affordable health coverage. That's something that should be their right."" 
   The Rockefeller bill would also give tax credits to employers, so they could benefit from the advantages and protections available to group insurance purchasers. Under SEHBP, employers would receive an annual tax credit to defray part of the costs employers incur providing health insurance for low-wage workers - those who make $25,000 or less per year. The employer tax credit would be equal to 25 percent of employer costs for workers who are single, 30 percent for those employees who are either married or single with a child, and 35 percent for family policies. The wage limitation would be adjusted annually for inflation. 
   In addition, employers who cover more than 60 percent of a low-wage worker's health insurance premium would receive a bonus tax credit. The bonus would be equivalent to a 5 percent add-on per additional 10 percent of premium covered. If the employer covers an additional 20 percent of the premium, an additional 10 percent tax credit would be granted.

MURKOWSKI WINS APPROVAL FOR $50 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR FIREFIGHTERS ASSISTANCE
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski, arguing that firefighters as first responders are part of the backbone of our response to emergencies or terrorist attacks, this morning succeeded in winning an additional $50 million for firefighter assistance funding during debate on a Homeland Security appropriations bill continuing in the U.S. Senate. 
   Murkowski on Thursday had proposed an amendment to provide additional funding for grants for equipment, training and safety improvements for the nation's firefighters. The amendment was approved this morning on the Senate floor and added to the Homeland Security appropriations bill (H.R. 4567) for FY' 05 that the Senate should finish early next week.
   ""As we approach the third anniversary of the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks, we can't help but be reminded of the risks that our nation's firefighters take daily to keep us safe in time of emergency. We must do all that we can to make sure that we provide firefighters all the resources necessary to help them fight fires and to help them remain safe as they perform their dangerous, but vital work for this nation. These grants provide assistance to local fire fighters to protect the health and safety of the public and of firefighting personnel, including volunteers and emergency medical service workers,"" said Murkowski Thursday prior to adoption of her amendment to another provision in the $33.1 billion Homeland Security spending bill.
   The $50 million addition (Second Degree Amdt. 3616 to Amdt. 3578) brings to $750 million the amount of funding available for firefighter assistance grants for the coming year, a slight increase in funding over this year. Murkowski was joined in the amendment by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and by several other senators.
   In the 2003-2004 funding cycle, 44 Alaska fire departments earned $4,532,039 in fire grants to purchase fire apparatus, equipment and training. Another $710,000 was awarded to Alaska Village Initiatives to place fire apparatus custom designed to meet the needs of rural Alaska in the villages. Alaska departments have submitted 67 applications seeking $11.9 million in fire grants in the current funding cycle. Murkowski said the additional funds are critically needed for Alaska. The National Fire Protection Association of Quincy, Massachusetts reported in June 2004 that nearly two-thirds of fire engines in Alaska are over 15 years old, approximately 42 percent of firefighters on a shift lack portable radios and self-contained breathing apparatus, and nearly a quarter of Alaska firefighters lack personal protective clothing.
   ""It has truly been a long, hot summer for Alaska's firefighters who have been helping battle the wildfires, while still protecting all Alaskans from normal fire dangers. These additional funds should help Alaska firefighters continue to succeed in the nationwide competition for fire grants,"" said Murkowski.
   The full amendment includes an additional $50 million for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and added funding for the federal air marshal program, $50 million in additional funding for grants to protect high-risk terrorist targets, and $20 million for emergency management performance grants.

   ""The third anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks helps to remind us how we need to improve the security of all forms of transportation in this country, not just aviation, but also ferry and rail service and the security at our ports. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorist attacks on this country continues. These grants provide needed federal assistance to our state to help meet those threats,"" said Senator Murkowski.
   She said the grants being announced today by the Department of Homeland Security include:
   * $189,000 to the Alaska Marine Highway System to beef up security on the state's ferry system.
   * $175,000 to the Alaska Interisland Ferry Authority based in Ketchikan to improve security on its ferries serving Prince of Wales Island.
   * $297,010 to the Alaska Railroad to fund a video surveillance system at the railroad's yard in Seward.
   * $200,000 to Wrangell to increase security at port and dock facilities in the Southeast town.
   * And two grants to Valdez, $8,800 for new barriers at the Valdez port and $125,000 for an electronic access system.
   ""Besides protecting passengers on our ferries and the Alaska Railroad, it is welcome indeed that Homeland Security had provided additional grants to beef up security in Valdez, the site of the terminal for the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The grants will help to increase protection for the pipeline, the source of 80 percent of the state's revenues and of nearly a fifth of America's daily oil production,"" said Murkowski.

  In an effort to aid the Kenai Peninsula should the efforts to save the Agrium plant be unsuccessful, the Alaska Congressional Delegation has sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Labor urging that those affected by the closure be considered eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance.  
   Agrium U.S. Inc. is currently scheduled to shut down its Kenai Nitrogen Operations on Nov. 1, 2005. This is expected to cause the direct loss of 200 high paying skilled jobs and is likely to further impact more than 500 workers on the Kenai Peninsula. 
   ""Agrium is an important part of the Kenai Peninsula economy. The potential loss of jobs would be devastating to the already burdened community. Trade Adjustment assistance is needed to ensure that the people of the Kenai Peninsula are helped in every way possible,"" Senator Ted Stevens noted. 
   Through Trade Adjustment Assistance, the federal government aids communities where economies have been endangered through the impact of foreign trade. TAA can include health care, job training, and job relocation aid. In the past TAA has applied to industrial sectors such as the U.S. textile and shoe industries, which have suffered because of the increased competition from foreign products made possible by NAFTA and other trade agreements. 
   Alaska's Delegation was successful last year in having TAA apply to Alaska's fishermen as the fishing industry has been impacted severely through imports of foreign farmed fish. Similarly, the Delegation is now advocating TAA be applied to Agrium as the plant's closure is related to the shift of fertilizer plants overseas and the increased imports of nitrogen fertilizers as well as the high cost and low availability of domestic natural gas. 
   ""The potential closure of Agrium would further harm the Kenai Peninsula - where the unemployment rate is already four percent higher than the state's average. If Agrium is unable to stay open, we need to do all we can to help those that will be affected,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski said. 
   ""The closing of Agrium would be an extremely harsh blow to the overall economy of the Kenai Peninsula. The TAA would assist those affected and at best stabilize the economy,"" said Congressman Don Young. 
   During the past six years, 20 ammonia plants have closed in the United States, representing a drop of 20 percent in total U.S. production capacity. American production has fallen from 17.85 million tons in FY 1998-99 to 11.70 million tons in FY 2003-04. U.S. nitrogen imports have correspondingly risen to 10.36 million tons from 6.11 million tons during the same period. This trend has already claimed about 1,000 American jobs, according to The Fertilizer Institute.

  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has awarded grants to two fire departments in Alaska, part of $750 million that is being dispensed nationwide this year to ensure that local firefighters have the resources they need to be able to protect their communities. 
   Murkowski announced that the Big Lake Volunteer Fire Department outside of Wasilla on Thursday was awarded $29,598 to fund new equipment and operations, while the Sutton Fire Department outside of Palmer gained $92,408, also for equipment and to help fund operations. Murkowski added that the Wrangell Volunteer Fire Department has now received a grant for $44,701 for fire prevention efforts, while the Cordova Volunteer Fire Department has now received a grant for $64,457 for equipment and operations - two grants that had been announced but not formally conveyed earlier this month.
   ""I am pleased that the federal government is making money available to assist our local departments to handle their growing burdens,"" said Murkowski.
   The money, approved in the FY '04 Homeland Security Appropriations bill passed in January and supported by Murkowski, come from the Assistance for Firefighters Grant Program, administered by the Department's Office for Domestic Preparedness in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. The fire grants are authorized by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296).
   The money can be used for training, equipment purchases, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness and modifications to fire stations and facilities.

MURKOWSKI WELCOMES FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR CENTRAL FIRE ASSISTANCE DECLARATION
  Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed a decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to grant the state's and her request that the federal government issue a fire management assistance declaration specifically for the Central complex fire northeast of Fairbanks. The declaration, issued late Tuesday by FEMA, makes the state eligible for federal funding to pay for up to 75 percent of its costs involved in fighting the 260,000 acres of wildfires in the area. 
   ""It is good that the federal government understands the serious nature of all the wildfires continuing to burn in Alaska, and has expanded its previous assistance declaration for the Boundary fire and fires near Tok to take in the Bolgen Creek fire and the other fires burning in the Central area. This fire is threatening a number of subdivisions between Central and Circle Hot Springs and the state needs additional federal financial assistance to help bring the fires in the area under control,"" said Senator Murkowski this morning.
   The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program allows the federal government to pick up 75 percent of allowable costs. They include the:
   * Costs for equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds);
   * Costs for emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control);
   * Costs for state emergency operations centers;
   * Costs for the pre-positioning of federal, out-of-state resources for up to 21 days;
   * Costs for personal comfort and safety items for firefighters;
   * Costs for field camps and meals in lieu of per diem;
   * Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs;
   * Costs for the temporary repair of damage caused by firefighting;
   * And the costs of mitigation, management and control of fires on co-mingled federal lands.
   Senator Murkowski said FEMA granted the fire disaster assistance request since the Bolgen Creek fire, which involves 49 percent state land and 49 percent federal land with 2 percent in private hands, has flared up burning 64,700 acres since July 13, and now threatens Central and some 100 residential and 20 commercial properties.
   The Senator said she will continue to monitor state and federal agency needs to battle all of the fires now burning in the state.
   As of yesterday some 100 separate fires were still burning in Alaska having blackened 4.569 million acres so far this summer. The Central complex fire, which includes the Wolf Creek and Crazy fires northeast of Fairbanks, is the most serious at the moment, even though the 508,000-acre Boundary fire continues to burn in the headwaters of the Little Chena River and the 240,000-acre Taylor complex fire was also again active on Tuesday.

MURKOWSKI: LEGISLATION WILL CURB FRIVOLOUS CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS
  Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski today welcomed Senate passage of bipartisan legislation, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (S.5), to bring more fairness to the class action rules, and to help curb frivolous class action lawsuits.  
   ""I am pleased that the Senate took action today to help end frivolous lawsuits and the litigation tax that affects us all due to the manipulation of class action rules,"" said Murkowski. ""It is a good step toward solving some of the real problems we currently have with our legal system."" 
   ""This bill directly and effectively addresses the recent explosion of frivolous class action lawsuits in our country that have caused excessive attorney fee awards, unprecedented costs to our national economy and a declining respect for our judicial system,"" Murkowski noted after the Senate passed the class action reform bill 72 -26. ""It is court reform, not tort reform."" 
   The major provisions of the Class Action Fairness Bill are: 
   Federal District Court Jurisdiction for Interstate Class Actions - The legislation creates federal jurisdiction over class actions in which the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million and any member of a plaintiff class is a citizen of a different state from any defendant. The bill also treats certain mass actions with more than 100 plaintiffs as class actions for purposes of jurisdiction (as long as each plaintiff seeks $75,000 in relief). 
   Consumer Class Action Bill of Rights - This provision is designed to ensure that class members are the primary beneficiaries of the class actions process. The bill requires that judges carefully review all coupon settlements and limit attorney's fees paid in coupon settlements to the value actually received by class members; requires careful scrutiny of ""net loss"" settlements in which class members end up losing money; bans settlements that award some class members a larger recovery because they live closer to the court; and allows federal courts to maximize the benefit of class action settlement. 
   Notice to Public Officials - This provision requires a notice of proposed settlements be provided to appropriate state and federal officials such as attorney generals. 
   Local Class Action Exception - This provision keeps local controversies in state court and allows removal of class actions that are truly interstate in character to federal court. Under this provision, cases would stay in state court if the plaintiffs have sued at least one in-state defendant whose conduct forms a significant basis of their claims; if the principal injuries occurred in the state where the suit is brought; and if no class action has been filed alleging the same claims against any of the defendants in the last three years.

APPROPRIATIONS BILL May 3  2006 Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  spoke before the United States Senate and submitted for the record the following statement on his amendment  to strike  74 5 million for grants to States based on their production of certain types of crops  livestock and dairy products  to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill   Mr  President  I call up Amendment  3616  and ask for its immediate consideration  This amendment would strike  74 5 million for grants to States based on their production of certain types of crops  livestock and dairy products  which was not included in the Administration s emergency supplemental request   Mr  President  it has been a longstanding policy in the United State Senate to prohibit the practice of adding authorizing language to an appropriations bill  Nevertheless  this bill includes a massive  3 94 billion Agriculture Assistance program  None of the funding under this agriculture title was included in the Administration s supplemental request  Interestingly  this nearly  4 billion add on  Title III of the underlying bill  received only a one paragraph mention in the entire Committee Report accompanying the bill  One paragraph to describe 31 pages of legislative language with a  4 billion price tag  Let me read it for the benefit of my colleagues who have not had the opportunity to review the report   TITLE III  EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE  The Committee recommends  3 944 000 000 for emergency agricultural disaster assistance  These funds will help farmers and ranchers in States affected by recent hurricanes  drought  flood  wildfire  and other natural disasters recover from resulting production losses  These funds will also assist in the removal of debris from watersheds in order to minimize the threat of flooding from future storm events  In addition  the funds will provide economic assistance to producers to compensate for high energy costs relating to agricultural production   Mr  President  I m all for helping to the extent appropriate farmers and other victims battered by hurricanes  But the agricultural assistance added in this bill is far more expansive than merely offering help to areas hit by the 2005 hurricanes and at least the limited report language doesn t hide that fact   As my colleagues know  the USDA currently has a range of disaster assistance programs including crop insurance programs that are already available  Yet this bill is going to add nearly  4 billion on top of the existing programs  In my view  the agriculture assistance funding is being used more as a vehicle to fill a voter wish list than it is meet the urgent needs of the victims of the 2005 hurricane season  Taxpayer dollars are being allocated for agriculture subsidies and bail outs which  in some cases  have nothing to do with hurricane recovery   Mr  President  my amendment would strike an earmark that provides  74 5 million in agriculture assistance for grants to States based on their production of specialty of crops  livestock and dairy products Why is this necessary  Have the hurricanes wiped out the specialty crop industry  What even is a specialty crop and why does it need  74 5 million of taxpayer funding  I hope that a specialty crop is a money tree because that is what is going to be needed to pay for this bill   My colleagues may be interested to know that the bill defines speciality crops as anything but wheat  feed grains  oilseeds  cotton  rice  or peanuts  Anything but  Why do we exclude those commodities from receiving this funding  Is sugarcane made ineligible   Are my colleagues aware that the USDA already has a Specialty Crop Block Grant Program that was authorized in 2004  Under the existing program  speciality crops are defined as fruits  vegetables  treenuts  dried fruits  and nursery crops  including floriculture  The program is funded at  7 million for the current fiscal year and it provides  100 000 grants to each State that applies  Is there a problem with that program that I am not aware of that gives just cause to providing it with an emergency supplemental appropriation to the tune of more one thousand percent above its annual appropriation   Mr  President  this bill provides  74 5 million that is to be used to award grants based on the share of each State s total value of specialty crop  livestock  and dairy production of the United states for the 2004 crop year multiplied by  74 5 million  That means the more you ve produced   if your crops have not been hit by a natural disaster or flooding or drought   the more money you get  That is the polar opposite of what the USDA disaster assistance programs are about  And doesn t that fly in the face of what an emergency supplemental is for  An emergency supplemental is supposed to be about addressing needs and not about providing rewards for productivity  And more importantly  why is what obviously is designed to be a nationwide agriculture funding assistance program   a program not requested by the Administration and singled out in the Statement of Administration Policy as objectionable   being included in a must pass emergency spending bill that is supposed to address the Global War on Terror and Hurricane recovery   My colleagues may be interested to know that under this legislation  States can use the grant to promote the purchase  sale or consumption of agricultural products  Hmm  Last week I mentioned that federal dollars had been used to paint salmon on airplanes  Maybe that  74 5 million will be used to paint vegetables on airplanes  Or maybe a pretty flower  Or maybe a nice acorn  How about some dried apricots or prunes  That would be sure to increase consumption   Upon closer reading of the legislative language  I notice that the appropriators actually have created a  100 million program for specialty crops  In addition to the  74 5 million  it provides for  25 5 million to make grants to the several States  the District of Columbia  and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to be used to support activities that promote agriculture  Again  I envision painted murals of specialty crops  not that anyone would know that when they are looking at a carrot  they are witness to a specialty crop   I hope the sponsors of this legislation will correct me if I m wrong  and I m confident that they will  but it appears that with respect to the  25 5 million funding  the bill provides that all 50 states will each receive  500 000 of that money  while Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia each will receive  250 000  Mr  President  what specialty crops are grown in DC   What kind of campaign should we expect from the District of Columbia as it uses these funds to support activities that promote agriculture  Will they paint vegetables on the metro trains   This funding is not needed  Mr  President   It should be noted that according to OMB In 2005  many crops had record or near record production  and U S  farm sector cash receipts were the second highest ever  Can a unrequested  74 4 million grant program truly be sold as an urgent  emergency spending need at this time   Mr  President  I know my colleagues have the highest hopes for the success and safety of our troops  and for the speedy recovery of the hurricane ravaged Gulf  But when the American people hear of these special interest riders  they re going to question our priorities   and rightly so   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment                                             May

KYL: EXTEND TAX RELIEF TO KEEP ECONOMY GROWING
  In anticipation of House of Representatives action on H.R. 4297, the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act of 2005 later today, and Senate vote tomorrow, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) welcomed the advancement, noting the success of today's economy is in large part due to the pro-growth tax relief policies extended in this legislation. 
   ""We should recognize the economic successes we enjoy today are the result of the policies the Senate is set to extend in the tax reconciliation relief bill tomorrow,"" said Kyl. ""It's undeniable that the tax-relief policies we implemented in 2003 have contributed to record-level Treasury revenues, low unemployment rates, all-time stock market highs, and overall economic strength.""
   Government estimators had predicted that the reduction in capital gains tax rates enacted in 2003 would cost the federal government $27 billion in lost revenues for 2004, but the Congressional Budget Office now reports that the lower rates actually brought in an additional $26 billion in revenue. So instead of costing $27 billion, the lower rates made $26 billion for the U.S. Treasury.
   Since August 2003, the economy has created nearly 5.3 million jobs (138,000 new jobs in April alone). The economy has experienced 32 consecutive months of job growth and is creating better jobs in high-wage fields. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.7 percent - the lowest in nearly five years, and well below the averages of the last four decades.
   The nation's gross domestic product - the leading indicator of economic growth - grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. This follows the nation's economic growth rate of 3.5 percent in 2005 - the fastest rate of any major industrialized nation in the world.
   ""This week, the Dow Jones hit a six-year high,"" said Kyl. ""And now all eyes are watching the market to see whether the stock market will hit its highest level ever - it's nonsense to believe the tax policies in place have not helped our economy. Extending tax relief will sustain our growing economy.

  By Sen. Jon Kyl
   Last year I introduced legislation that would make permanent all of the major sections of the USA Patriot Act that are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Last week, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged Congress to renew the act and provided a great deal of supportive evidence.  
   The most critical function of the act, which was passed in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, has been to break down the historical wall between traditional criminal and intelligence-related investigations. But it has also provided new and better legal tools to law enforcement agencies for wiretapping, executing search warrants, and in many other areas where previous law was either simply inadequate to begin with, or rendered obsolete by the nature of modern terrorism and technological advances like cell phones, voice mail and the Internet. 
   FBI Director Robert Mueller has repeatedly testified that the act's provisions have proven extraordinarily beneficial in the war on terrorism and have been directly responsible for many counterterrorism successes. Clinton Administration Attorney General Janet Reno agrees, stating publicly that ""everything that's been done in the Patriot Act has been helpful."" Still, there has been a considerable amount of criticism of the act from people who wonder whether its provisions might be abused. There is much misinformation about the act, particularly sections 213 and 215: 
   Section 213 of the Patriot Act codifies judicial common law, allowing investigators to delay giving notice to the target that a search warrant has been executed against his property if a court finds reasonable cause to believe that immediate notice may result in: endangering an individual; flight from prosecution; destruction of evidence; intimidation of potential witnesses; or if such notice would otherwise seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay a trial. Notice must still be provided ""within a reasonable period"" of the warrant's execution, though this period may be extended by the court for good cause. 
   The need for such authority is obvious: it allows investigators to uncover specific information about a terror suspect's activities or associates without tipping their hand. There would be no point in conducting a wiretap, for example, if the target had to be immediately informed that his conversations were being monitored. Likewise, if immediate notice were required after every kind of search, many suspects would flee the country, destroy computer files, alert associates, injure or kill witnesses, or simply accelerate a planned attack. 
   Although critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have called section 213 ""sneak and peek"" and decried it as a ""sea change"" in U.S. law, the reality is that the U.S. Supreme Court established 25 years ago that this procedure is constitutional, and has consistently reaffirmed this view. In fact, in a 1979 case, the Court specifically derided the argument that delayed-notice searches are unconstitutional as ""frivolous."" Perhaps one reason was that, according to the Justice Department, the most common period of delay of notice authorized has been a mere seven days. 
   Section 215 relates to subpoena authority for business records, extending to ""terrorism"" the types of crimes for which so-called business records can be sought. The law has always recognized that book store and library records are included. To obtain such rescords, a subpoena must be pre-approved by a judge, which means that the frequently-cited fear of ""the FBI investigating someone simply because of the books that he borrows from a library"" is false. As an added protection against abuse, the Patriot Act requires that the FBI ""fully inform"" the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on all use of such authority. Again, this authority is not new - federal investigators have long used the grand jury subpoena to obtain bookstore records. As the Washington Post noted in a September 11, 2003 editorial, investigative authority to review library records ""existed prior to the Patriot Act; the law extends it to national security investigations, which isn't unreasonable."" 
   Finding out whether a suspect checked out a book on bomb making is a reasonable investigative technique. Moreover, it has been well established that terrorists and spies - the September 11th hijackers, for example - have used libraries to plan and carry out activities that threaten U.S. national security, among other ways by using their Internet access to communicate by email. Given this reality, it would be foolish to place libraries and bookstores off-limits to investigations. 
   More broadly, given the demonstrated success of the Patriot Act in making us more secure, and the paucity of actual (as opposed to hypothetical) complaints of abuse, it would surely be unwise to start rescinding its major provisions.

KYL BACKS STEM-CELL RESEARCH WHILE PROTECTING HUMAN LIFE
  The Senate today approved two bills that expand stem-cell research, but one does so without destroying human life. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) voted for the bill that expands research within ethical limits.  
   S.30, the HOPE Act, was approved by the Senate 70 to 28 and directs the Department of Health and Human Services to seek out alternative sources of stem cells and to study the possibility of establishing an amniotic and placental stem-cell bank, similar to the bone marrow and cord blood stem-cell bank, while reaffirming a policy that prohibits research that destroys human life. 
   ""We live in an age when medical miracles occur every day, many of which are the result of stem-cell research,"" said Kyl. ""I favor the broadest possible effort to pursue promising medical technologies within appropriate ethical limits, and I believe the legislation authored by Senators Isakson and Coleman does exactly that. It builds on the research that is currently treating patients, and encourages the expansion of stem-cell research in a responsible way. 
   ""By contrast, I voted against the alternative bill introduced by Senator Reid, because I believe that taxpayers should not have to subsidize the destruction of human life, especially when a number of state governments and large universities have already directed significant resources to embryonic stem-cell research. On lines beyond those already authorized for federally-funded research, there are billions of dollars available for embryonic stem-cell research on lines from newly destroyed embryos, and increases in federal funding and a change in the federal policy are not necessary."" 
   S.5, Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, was also approved by the Senate 63 to 34 and is similar to legislation vetoed by the President in 2006. The bill overturns a key element of current policy by allowing taxpayer dollars to be used to subsidize the extraction of stem cells from the destruction of human embryos. 
   Both bills will now be sent to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.

  At the beginning of 2006, I wrote a column outlining some New Year's resolutions for Congress: enhancing border security, working to maintain lower tax rates, reauthorizing the Patriot Act to better go after terrorists, and helping to effectively implement the Medicare prescription drug program. With the 109th Congress coming to a close, now would be a good time to take a look back at the progress with these priorities. 
   ENHANCING BORDER SECURITY  
   Over the past two years, Congress approved legislation increasing the amount of federal dollars being dedicated to border security. We've funded an increase of 3,736 new border patrol agents (for a total of 14,555), additional surveillance equipment, roads and vehicle barriers, an increased number of detention spaces, and border fencing. While these resources will better help secure our borders, much work remains to be done, and it is my hope that the momentum that has been built will continue next year. 
   MAINTAINING LOW TAX RATES 
   The most recent statistics released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that Arizona is the fastest growing state (according to job growth and gross state product) in the country. In Arizona and nationwide, economists attribute the strength of the economy largely to the pro-growth tax policies of 2001 and 2003. 
   Almost two million Arizonans benefited from the lower tax rates enacted in 2003. Of this figure, more than 400,000 Arizonans benefited from the reduction of the capital gains and dividends tax rates (35 percent of Arizona's taxpayers who benefited had incomes of $50,000 or less); many of these were senior citizens, who rely on this investment income. 
   I spearheaded the successful effort this year to extend the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends through 2010, so that Americans can plan their investments with the certainty of knowing what the applicable tax rates will be. 
   KEEPING AMERICA SAFE 
   Congress continues to provide more tools to intelligence agents and prosecutors to fight terrorists. Earlier this year, Congress renewed the Patriot Act, which enhances the capability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to effectively combat terrorism. Legislation I drafted, the Tools to Fight Terrorism Act, supplements the Patriot Act by, among other things, authorizing foreign intelligence search warrants for monitoring suspected lone-wolf terrorists and making it a criminal and deportable offense to receive training at a terrorist training camp; punishing hoaxes perpetrated about terrorist crimes or the deaths of U.S. soldiers in wartime; and creating tough, mandatory penalties for possession of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or anti-aircraft missiles. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues next year to ensure that our intelligence and law enforcement officials have all the tools they need to investigate, stop, and punish terrorist conspiracies. 
   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM 
   This was also the year for implementation of the Medicare prescription drug program. While the roll-out experienced startup challenges, over 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are now receiving some form of comprehensive prescription drug coverage (over 500,000 Arizonans are enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug plan). It's important to remember that seniors didn't have any comprehensive prescription drug coverage before this year. 
   Also, due to strong competition, monthly premiums are lower than anticipated - the average premium is $24 in 2006, meaning beneficiaries save an average of over $1,100 per year. Robust competition combined with increased beneficiary choice has resulted in better health coverage options, lower prices, and reliable savings. 
   While I believe we can look back at the past year with some satisfaction over the progress Congress has made, there are still many major issues that remain unresolved. I look forward to returning in January to tackle many pending issues, such as immigration reform; and it is my hope that Congress will be able to work in a bipartisan way to accomplish what's necessary for America's future.

  The President recently unveiled his proposed budget for 2009. The budget proposal outlines the operating budget for the entire federal government. I will report to you on parts of the budget that particularly impact Arizona; and this week I'd like to concentrate on the proposed funding for the US Forest Service.
   The President has budgeted $4.109 billion for the Forest Service - a seven percent reduction from 2008 funding. There are significant cuts across the board; the most critical are the cuts to hazardous fuel reduction accounts (which the Forest Service has identified as its number one priority). These accounts are funded at $297 million, down from $310 million in 2008. 
   Fire-fighting expenses increase by $148 million to just under $1 billion. Last year, the Forest Service spent $1.4 billion fighting fires nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Interior Department spent an additional $450 million.
   With almost 48 percent of the proposed budget going toward fire fighting, the Forest Service might be more appropriately called the ""Fire Service.""
   I believe funding for fighting fires must be complemented by adequate funding for preventing them. Proactive management of our forests not only is the best tool in combating wildfires, it is critical to restoring forest health and improving habitats for diverse species.
   Typically, there are two complimentary methods of treatment: mechanical thinning of brush and smaller diameter trees, and prescribed burning. These treatments open up forests so they are less susceptible to ""hot"" crown fires. More importantly, reducing competition for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight immediately enhances the health of the trees, allowing them to grow bigger and fend off diseases and deadly insects like bark beetles.
   The 2006 ""February Fire"" that consumed over 4,000 acres of Tonto National Forest in Arizona highlights our ongoing struggle to adequately prepare for and expeditiously suppress wildfires. It also shows the need to significantly increase the amount of forest acres treated by mechanical thinning and prescribed burning. Had it not been for the previous treatments (and burned areas) in parts of the fire's path, the damage would have been far worse.
   I was pleased to see that this proposed budget includes funding for a pilot project with partners in the Southwest Ecosystem Restoration Institutes to develop and test prioritizing restoration-based fuel reduction treatments.
   In 2004, I helped draft legislation to create federally-recognized ecological restoration institutes (ERI) to demonstrate and promote the application of forest thinning and other tested treatments to lands at risk of severe wildfires. The Ecological Research Institute at Northern Arizona University received official federal recognition under this legislation, making it one of only three such institutes in the nation. Since the bill's enactment in 2004, I've been fighting to get ERI in the budget, so that Congress does not have to add the funding (we still have to ensure that Congressional appropriations bills include the President's budget request).
   As Arizona prepares to enter its wildfire season, it's critically important that the Forest Service has the resources to prevent wildfires before they happen. It's too bad we have to spend more money fighting fires than investing in ecological restoration, which could prevent fires and improve the forest at the same time. I will do what I can through the Congressional appropriations process to ensure that the Forest Service has the resources it needs to both fight and prevent forest fires, as well as carry out all its other important responsibilities.

   ""A Harvard professor once appropriately likened Internet gambling to using crack cocaine,"" said Kyl. ""Gambling can be highly addictive, especially when it's done over an unregulated environment such as the Internet."" 
   The core of the House legislation is similar to the proposals that Kyl has championed. H.R. 4411 would require the U.S. Treasury Department to issue regulations that would prohibit approving a transaction between a U.S.-based customer account and an Internet gambling merchant. Financial institutions would have to follow those regulations. 
   ""For more than a decade, I have fought for legislation to enforce Internet gambling prohibitions,"" said Kyl. ""Today's action in the House is a very encouraging step, and I will work with my colleagues to explore all ways to move this much-needed legislation through the Senate this year."" 
   Many legal, governmental, and collegiate groups have endorsed efforts to combat gambling activity in cyberspace including the National Association of Attorneys General, which has expressed strong support. The Federal Trade Commission has also acknowledged the harms of Internet gambling and the National Collegiate Athletic Association is particularly concerned about the risks to college students and has urged a legislative remedy.

LIEBERMAN, MCCAIN, KYL, GRAHAM, COLEMAN OFFER IRAN AMENDMENT
  Senators Lieberman, McCain, Kyl, Graham, and Coleman today introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Defense Authorization Act, confronting the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran over its proxy attacks on American soldiers in Iraq.  
   The amendment details the publicly available evidence put forward over the past year by General David Petraeus, commanding general of Multi-National Force Iraq, and others about Iran's violent and destabilizing activities in Iraq. 
   The amendment states that ""the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable act of hostility against the United States,"" and demands the government of Iran ""take immediate action"" to end all forms of support it is providing to Iraqi militias and insurgents. The amendment also mandates a regular report on Iran's anti-coalition activity in Iraq. 
   ""For many months, our military commanders and diplomats have warned us that the Iranian government has been training, equipping, arming, and funding proxies in Iraq who are murdering our troops,"" said Senator Lieberman. ""This amendment is a common sense, common ground statement of the Senate to Tehran: we know what you are doing, and you must stop."" 
   ""American officials attest that the government in Teheran seeks to bleed the United States and render unsuccessful our efforts to bring about a stable and self-governing in Iraq,"" said Senator McCain. ""This amendment will send a clear signal: Iran's activities in Iraq are wrong, and they must end immediately."" 
   ""The Iranians are attempting to thwart our policies in the Middle East by actively supporting terrorists who are killing our troops in Iraq,"" said Senator Kyl. ""It is time we acknowledge this hostility against us, and this amendment tells the Iranians we will not tolerate any actions which threaten our troops or allies."" 
   ""The evidence is increasingly clear the Iranian government is working to destabilize the Iraqi government,"" said Senator Graham. ""It is long past time for Congress to speak out about this destructive behavior by Iran. We need one voice, and I expect it will be a unified bipartisan voice, speaking out and condemning these actions by the Iranian government."" 
   ""The United States will not tolerate Iran's hostile attempts to sabotage our efforts in the Middle East region,"" said Senator Coleman. ""On my last trip to Iraq, our Minnesota troops in Southern Iraq showed me Iranian-made explosives that were used against them on convoy missions. This crucial amendment makes it clear to the Iranian government, and any other government in the region that seeks to harm our soldiers, that providing any form of support to Iraqi insurgents will not be tolerated and must cease immediately.""

  The 110th Congress will define how each political party proposes to address health care reform. The debates over programs such as the Medicare drug plans or the State Children's Health Insurance Program boil down to a difference between those who want more affordable options for health care insurance or more government programs. The differences also involve more or less interference between physicians and patients. 
   There are a number of reasons health care is becoming more expensive: there are more and better treatments, tests, drugs and devices; people are living longer; and lawsuits against medical providers raise insurance rates. It also costs a lot to train health care professionals. And as the nation's fastest growing state, Arizona exemplifies the challenges ahead.  
   In the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) most recent analysis of state health workforce data, Arizona ranked 49th among states in per capita health services employment. HRSA estimates that Arizona only has 172 physicians per 100,000 people, well below the national average. 
   That same report also recognized that Arizona's population is projected to grow 18 percent between 2000 and 2020, and that the number of those 65 and older is projected to grow 72 percent. 
   In 2005, nearly 47 million people were uninsured nationwide. Arizona experienced one of the largest percentage increases in its uninsured population, reaching nearly one million Arizonans without health coverage. If left unchecked, these challenges will place an increasing financial burden on health care providers, federal and state governments, and taxpayers. 
   Earlier this year, in his State of the Union address, the President started the debate by proposing some bold health reform initiatives. The goal is to ensure access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The question is how? 
   The answer lies first in looking at what is working today. Rather than building a complex program for the government to provide prescription drugs to seniors, the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2004 expanded private health plan choices and competition in Medicare. It also emphasized prevention, disease management, patient safety, and quality, and made Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) more attractive, permanent, and available to all consumers. And, the MMA required more transparent accounting of Medicare's long-term liabilities. 
   Over 90 percent of those eligible have signed up and the program enjoys more than an 80 percent satisfaction rating. Costs have been reduced and there are many more choices than would exist in a purely government-run program. 
   Another answer starts by asking: what do patients want? The answer is access, affordability, quality, and individual choice and control without a lot of complexity or long waits. 
   Health Care America, a nonpartisan organization devoted to promoting access, choice, quality, innovation and competition in our health care system, recently released a national survey of 1,000 registered voters. The survey asked voters to consider a European-style health care system and asked them to rank tradeoffs (such as longer wait times and quality of service) as acceptable, unacceptable, or neutral. Voters ranked all tradeoffs as unacceptable. 
   What ranked as the most unacceptable tradeoffs? Longer wait times for doctor appointments and hospital procedures, a three-month waiting time between a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, and limited treatment options, such as an approved drug list. 
   I share the findings of this survey for two reasons. First, it confirms what we already know - patients want access to affordable health coverage. They want a doctor or hospital of their choice. And, they want the highest quality care. 
   Second, while Americans want more affordable coverage options, they are not asking their political leaders to abandon everything and start over. Americans' dissatisfaction with the current system does not signal a preference for a government-run health care system. In fact, the survey highlights that patients worry about an expanded government role and how it will affect the doctor-patient relationship and quality of care. 
   I support a consumer-driven, patient-focused health care system that harnesses the competitive market to lower costs, expands access to coverage, and maintains individual control over health care decisions. 
   The 110th Congress must make health care a priority. Among the reforms we should consider are small business health plans, medical liability reform, tax breaks for purchasing health insurance, and improved ways to save for future, long-term health care expenses.

action  It s time for a new and comprehensive strategy  like the plan that Senator McCain and I propose to secure our borders  strengthen our economy  and respect our history as a nation of immigrants  President Bush must do more than give speeches   he must demonstrate leadership by standing up and saying no to his right wing allies who just want to close up our borders  As business leaders agree

        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      Mr  President  this is one of the most important votes the Senate will take this year  The issues raised by Mr  Gonzales s nomination go to the heart of what America stands for in the world and the fundamental values that define us as a nation   our commitment to individual dignity  our respect for the rule of law  and our reputation around the world as a beacon for human rights  not as a violator of human rights    President Bush said it well in his Inaugural Address last month  From the day of our Founding  we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights  and dignity  and matchless value  because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth  The world is watching to see if our actions match our rhetoric     How can the Senate possibly approve the nomination of Mr  Gonzales as Attorney General of the United States  the official who symbolizes our respect for the rule of law  when Mr  Gonzales is the official in the Bush Administration who  as White House Counsel  advised the President that torture was an acceptable method of interrogation in Afghanistan  Guantanamo  and Iraq     Torture is contrary to all that we stand for as Americans  It violates our basic values  It is alien to our military s longstanding rules and traditions  We send our men and women in the Armed Services into battle to stop torture in other countries  not to participate in it themselves     These values did not change  or become less relevant  after 9 11  Americans did not resolve to set aside our values  or the Constitution  after those vicious attacks  We didn t decide as a nation to stoop to the level of the terrorists    To the contrary  Americans have been united in the belief that an essential part of winning the war on terrorism and protecting the country for the future is safeguarding the ideals and values that America stands for here at home and around the world      Americans agree that torture is  and should remain  beyond the pale  A recent poll in USA Today showed that Americans strongly disapprove of the interrogation tactics that have been used in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo   including the use of painful stress positions  sexual humiliation  threatening prisoners with dogs  and threatening to ship them to countries known to practice torture     The American public has held fast to our most fundamental values   How could our government have gone so wrong     In many ways  the story of Mr  Gonzales s life represents the best of America  He was raised in a small house in north Houston  with no hot water or telephone  by parents who were migrant farm workers     As a teenager  he sold soft drinks in Rice Stadium and wondered what it would be like to attend that great university as a student  He enrolled at Rice after service in the Air Force  then obtained a law degree at Harvard  He became a partner at Houston s largest law firm and a justice on the Texas Supreme Court  and has served as one of the President s closest advisers over the past four years  I have nothing but the highest respect for his accomplishments  but that is not the issue     But  Mr  Gonzales is at the center of a torture policy that has run roughshod over the values that Americans hold so dear  On issue after issue in developing this policy  he has endorsed expediency over the rule of law     He adopted an absurdly narrow definition of torture in order to permit extreme interrogation practices     He advocated an unjustifiably expansive view of President power  purporting to put the Executive Branch above the law     He ignored the plain language of the Geneva Conventions in an attempt to immunize those who may commit war crimes     He continues to push a discredited interpretation of our treaty obligations to permit the C I A  to commit cruel  inhuman and degrading acts outside the United States     He refuses to be candid about his interpretations  policies  and intentions                 The Administration s policy on torture was established in August 2002  in a Justice Department document called the Bybee   or more accurately the Bybee Gonzales   Memorandum    This memorandum was written at Mr  Gonzales s request  Look at the first page  It reads Memorandum for Alberto R  Gonzales  Counsel to the President     The first two sentences read  You have asked for our Office s views regarding the standards of conduct under the Convention Against Torture and the Anti Torture Statute passed by Congress in 1994  As we understand it  this question has arisen in the context of the conduct of interrogations outside of the United States    After its release in August 2002  the memorandum became the official policy on interrogations by the Defense Department and the C I A  for two and a half years  until it was repudiated just last month at the last minute  on the eve of Mr  Gonzales s nomination    Yet Mr  Gonzales refuses to tell us anything about how the Bybee Gonzales Memorandum was written and why he ordered it  We know from press reports that the C I A  asked him for advice on how far the agency could go in interrogating detainees  In July 2002  he held meetings with other Administration officials to discuss how to legally justify certain interrogation methods  He refuses to tell us anything about those meetings    He says he can t remember what specific interrogation methods were discussed    He can t remember who asked for the Justice Department s legal advice in the first place    He can t remember whether he made any suggestions to the Department on the drafting of the Bybee  Gonzales Memorandum  although he admits that it would not be unusual for his office to have done so     He doesn t know how the memo was forwarded to the Defense Department and became part of its Working Group Report in April 2003  which was used to justify the new interrogation practices at Guantanamo  Those practices  in turn  to use the obscure word resorted to by the Administration  somehow migrated to U S  military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq  as if no human hand had been involved in the dissemination    Torture became a pervasive practice  The F B I  says so  The Red Cross says so  The Defense Intelligence Agency says so  The Defense Department says it has investigated more than 300 cases of detainee torture  sexual assault  and other abuse  Additional allegations of abuse   many of them too sickening to be described in open session on the floor of the Senate   are reported almost daily  Yet Mr  Gonzales can t remember the details of how any of it happened    The Judiciary Committee has repeatedly asked Mr  Gonzales to provide documents on his meetings  evaluations  and decisions on the Bybee Memorandum  These documents would speak volumes about all the issues Mr  Gonzales says he has trouble remembering  Yet he refuses to provide the documents  He won t even search for them  In his responses to our written questions  Mr  Gonzales stated eight times that he has not conducted a search for the requested documents  In other words  the documents we want may exist  but he s not going to look for them  It s hard to imagine a more arrogant insult to the constitutional role of the Senate in considering nominations    Mr  Gonzales refused to answer other questions and requests on the grounds that they would involve classified information  predecisional or internal deliberations  or deliberative material  None of these grounds is sufficient  There is no legal prohibition against providing classified material to Congress  It s routinely provided to Congress and discussed in closed meetings  There is no recognized privilege for predecisional or deliberative materials  The only exception is in the rare case where the President himself decides that his interest in secrecy outweighs the public interest in disclosure  and he himself invokes executive privilege  That hasn t happened here    It was clear when Mr  Gonzales was nominated that his involvement in the policy on prisoner detention and interrogation would be a major concern of the Senate  and that the Senate would need full information and materials on this subject  Serious abuses of detainees occurred in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo  Mr  Gonzales s role in developing their legal justification goes to the heart of the issue whether he should be confirmed as the nation s chief law enforcement officer      If we vote to confirm this nominee without insisting on answers to our questions  we ll be abdicating our advice and consent responsibility and weakening our oversight function precisely when it is needed most    The Bybee Gonzales Memorandum was not a law review article or newspaper op ed article  As Mr  Gonzales himself has said  it was the definitive legal opinion by the Justice Department on the rules on torture for the entire Executive Branch of the Government     We learned this past weekend from a New York Times article that the Justice Department s Criminal Division    then headed by Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff  now the nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security     was advising the CIA on the legality of specific interrogation techniques  using the Bybee Gonzales memo as its legal guideline     Further  the Times reported that there is a second Bybee memo which goes into even more detail than the first about which methods of coercion can be used  We have repeatedly asked for information about the original Bybee Gonzales memo and how it was used  The nominee and the White House have stonewalled us  We have repeatedly asked for other documents to be produced that would be relevant to understanding the first Bybee Gonzales memo  The nominee and the White House have stonewalled us     On Tuesday  Senator Durbin and I wrote a letter to the ranking members of the Judiciary and Government Accountability Committees outlining the pressing need for all relevant documents before we proceed to fully consider the nomination  Senator Durbin and I wrote    It is clear that the Senate should have the documents before it votes on these two nominations  since such materials go to the heart of the qualifications of the nominees to serve in the sensitive and important positions which they have been nominated for   We believe that both the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee should separately or jointly take the necessary steps to obtain all of the documents referred to in the article  and any other documents relating to the events and activities described in the article  The Senate should have an opportunity to assess all materials relating to the First and Second Bybee memorandums before it begins debate on the Gonzales and Chertoff nominations   In short  I am deeply disturbed that our constitutional role to review these nominations is being intentionally subverted through withholding of extremely relevant and important material     As far as we know  until the Department released its revised version of the memorandum last month  the Bybee Memorandum was the official and definitive Justice Department opinion on the definition of torture  on the legal defenses for those who commit torture  and on the power of the President to override laws and treaties on torture  Given the recent New York Times article  it may be that  in addition to the Second Bybee memo  which we do not have  there are many other memos on torture  but the White House has refused to disclose any of them    Harold Koh   a leading scholar of international law and Dean of the Yale Law School who served in both the Reagan and Clinton Administrations   calls the Bybee Memorandum the most clearly legally erroneous opinion he has ever read  As he told the Judiciary Committee    If the counsel for the President had received such an opinion  you would have expected him to do at least one of two things       First  reject it on the spot and send it back or  second  send it to other parts of the government and have them give a second opinion  particularly the State Department  which I believe  following the policies in the U S  Report on the Convention Against Torture  would have said that the opinion is flatly wrong    Instead        that opinion was allowed to become executive branch policy  was incorporated into the DOD working group report  and remained as executive branch policy for some two and a half years  during which time I believe that a permissive environment was inevitably created     That s what Harold Koh said at the hearing  and I hope every member of the Senate will take the time to read his testimony    In his response to our questions about the Bybee Memorandum  Mr  Gonzales said that he has no specific recollection of  his  reaction to the conclusions  reasoning  or appropriateness as a matter of policy of any of the particular sections of the memorandum at the time  he  received it two and a half years ago    He did say  however  that he believed at the time that it was a good faith effort to interpret the Anti Torture Statute  At the hearing  he told Senator Leahy  I don t recall today whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis  but I don t have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the Department     Let s review those conclusions  They are summarized on the memo s final page   The Bybee Memorandum made three basic points     First  it said that torture means only acts that inflict the kind of pain experienced with death or organ failure  That s what the memo said  the pain must be of an intensity akin to that which accompanies serious physical injury such as death or organ failure    Second  the memo said that the President has the inherent constitutional power as Commander in Chief to override the prohibitions against torture enacted by Congress  Application of the Anti Torture Statute to interrogations undertaken pursuant to the President s Commander in Chief powers may be unconstitutional  the memo said    Third  the memo said that even if a government official were to commit torture under the extremely narrow definition set forth  abusers could still invoke the defenses of necessity or self defense  As the memo states  necessity or self defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability  The memo made this outlandish claim  even though the Convention Against Torture  which Congress ratified in 1994  states very clearly that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever may be invoked as a justification for torture    Fourth  the memo states that even if the person inflicting pain knew that severe pain would result from his actions  he would not be guilty of a crime even if he acted without good faith if causing harm was not his primary objective  This analysis defines intent in a way that defines away most instances of torture  This is one of the serious errors in the Bybee Gonzales memo that was contradicted in new OLC memo of December 30  2004  which replaced the original memo    None of these points qualify as a reasonable or good faith legal argument  The Bybee Memorandum defined torture so narrowly that Saddam Hussein s lieutenants could have claimed immunity from prosecution for many of their crimes  Beating you  suffocating you  ripping out your fingernails  burning you with hot irons  suspending you from hooks  putting lighted cigarettes in your ear   none of these barbaric methods are categorically prohibited under the Bybee Memorandum  since none of them necessarily involved near death or organ failure  the specific conditions required by the memo to constitute torture     As Chairman Specter himself said today  the orginal Bybee Gonzales memo was erroneous in its legal conclusions  and its definition of torture  was not realistic or adequate  Nevertheless  Mr  Gonzales allowed it to stand for over two years  and allowed it to be disseminated to other agencies  like DOD  where major portions were absorbed verbatim into official policy  And now we know from the Times  that it was used in the Justice Department to approve specific extreme methods for the CIA    Mr  Gonzales also refused to tell us whether the extreme conduct at Guantanamo described in the F B I  e mails is illegal      This conduct included burning detainees with lighted cigarettes  exposing them to extreme temperatures  giving forcible enemas and holding them in prolonged stress positions in their own urine and feces  He explained his refusal to respond by saying to us   W ere the Administration to begin ruling out speculated interrogation practices in public  by virtue of gradually ruling out some practices in response to repeated questions and not ruling out others  we would fairly rapidly provide al Qaeda with a road map concerning the interrogation that captured terrorists can expect to face     That s arrogant nonsense  Our laws  our treaties  and our military field manuals all provide specific and clear guidance on where to draw the line on torture  Mr  Gonzales s failure to condemn these acts of torture only weakens America s standing in the world and sets back our efforts against terrorism    How can we confirm as the chief law enforcement officer a nominee who is afraid to stand up for the rule of law    To reach their narrow definition of torture  the authors of the Bybee Memorandum relied on totally unrelated federal statutes that define emergency medical conditions for purposes of providing health benefits  The revision last December of the Bybee Memorandum repudiated this analysis  stating that the statutes relied on do not define severe pain even in that very different context       and they do not state that death  organ failure  or impairment of bodily function cause  severe pain   Clearly  the memo s original definition of torture was wrong  If it applied in other countries  U S  soldiers and citizens traveling abroad would clearly be at risk    The Bybee Memorandum s provisions on Executive Power are also wholly inconsistent with the separation of powers in the Constitution  Article II  Section 3 directs the President to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed  Yet the Bybee Memorandum states that the federal Anti Torture Statute would be unconstitutional if it interferes with the President s direction of such core war matters as the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants    At a press conference in June 2004  Mr  Gonzales refused to say whether this statement remains good law for the Bush Administration  He would say only that the President has not exercised his Commander in Chief override  he has not determined that torture is  in fact  necessary to protect the national security of this country    Mr  Gonzales evaded questions on this issue by Committee members  To this day  we still do not know whether the President believes he has the power as Commander in Chief to authorize torture    There is no such thing as a Commander in Chief override  It s certainly not in my copy of the Constitution  It appears to be something that Mr  Gonzales and his colleagues have invented    Congress has repeatedly passed laws and ratified treaties prohibiting torture and mistreatment of detainees  and the President does not have the power to violate them     When a nominee claims that such an override exists  or suggests that those who commit torture might be able to invoke the defense of necessity or self defense notwithstanding Congress s categorical prohibition against such a defense  it sends a message that anything goes to our troops and intelligence officers in the field  To allow such extreme claims to become official U S  policy for two whole years was reckless and  in my view  disqualifying in any nominee for Attorney General    Mr  Gonzales has also demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the rule of law in his effort to facilitate the C I A  practice of ghost detainees  The Administration has always claimed to be in full compliance with the Geneva Conventions in Iraq  Yet in the spring of 2004  we learned from General Taguba that between six and eight of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison had not been registered as required by Army regulations and were being moved around the prison to avoid detection by the International Committee for the Red Cross  General Taguba described this practice as deceptive  contrary to Army doctrine and in violation of international law    In September  Army investigators told the Armed Services Committee that at the C I A  s direction  as many as 100 detainees at Abu Ghraib had been hidden from the Red Cross   and that the C I A  had refused requests to cooperate with the military investigation  This disclosure drew outrage from both Democrats and Republicans  Senator McCain said  The situation with the CIA ghost soldiers is beginning to look like a bad movie       This needs to be cleared up rather badly    Since then  we ve learned that Mr  Gonzales was a major architect of this policy  On March 19  2004  the Justice Department provided him with a draft memorandum   the so called Goldsmith Memorandum   to allow the C I A  to ship certain persons out of Iraq  Once again  the memo s first page reads  Memorandum for Alberto R  Gonzales  Counsel to the President  A separate cover page confirms that the opinion was requested by him  It s hard to imagine a clearer smoking gun    Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically states  Individual or mass forcible transfers  as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country  occupied or not  are prohibited  regardless of their motive  Violations of Article 49 constitute grave breaches of the Convention and therefore qualify as war crimes under federal law    In spite of the clear  unequivocal language of this provision  the Justice Department ruled that Article 49 does not in fact prohibit  for the purpose of facilitating interrogation  the temporary removal from Iraq of protected persons who have not been accused of a crime  Scott Silliman  an expert in military law at Duke University  observed that the Goldsmith memorandum seeks to create a legal regime justifying conduct that the international community clearly considers in violation of international law and the Convention     Although the memo was labeled draft  it was put into action  In October 2004  the Washington Post reported that one intelligence official familiar with the operation said the C I A  used the memo as legal support for secretly transporting as many as a dozen detainees out of Iraq in the last six months  The agency has concealed the detainees from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other authorities  the official said     The legal analysis in the Goldsmith Memorandum is preposterous  Yet it appears to have provided a legal justification for the C I A  to commit war crimes  As with the Bybee Memorandum  Mr  Gonzales has categorically refused to answer the Senate s questions about his involvement    He refuses to provide or even conduct a search for documents relating to his request for the Goldsmith Memorandum    He refuses to say anything about his discussions with the author of the memo    He says he doesn t know whether the C I A  acted on the memo  as the Washington Post reported    He even says that he has never had the occasion to come to definitive views about the analysis in the memo    Far from helping to clear the air  Mr  Gonzales has clouded it further  To let his nomination proceed would make a mockery of the notion of Congressional oversight and accountability    There are many other issues in Mr  Gonzales s record that should give members of the Senate pause    As predicted by Secretary Powell and senior military lawyers  Mr  Gonzales s memorandum of January 2002 on the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the war in Afghanistan brought a strong negative reaction from even our closest allies and lowered the bar for the protection of our own troops     According to the Schlesinger Report  in September 2003 military commanders in Iraq cited this memo as legal justification for the use of extreme interrogation techniques at Abu Ghraib prison  The worst abuses there occurred from September to December 2003    In his answers to the Committee  Mr  Gonzales made clear that the Administration does not consider the C I A  to be bound by the prohibition on cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment in Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture  This shift in legal policy was apparently made in a separate Justice Department memorandum which has also not been provided to Congress     Today  therefore  C I A  agents are authorized to treat detainees in a cruel  inhuman  and degrading manner   even if it violates constitutional rules in the U S    so long as they do not commit torture under the Department s narrow definition  President Bush also exempted the C I A  from his directive in February 2002 to treat all detainees humanely  This shameful change in policy obviously endangers the safety of American soldiers who are captured abroad     Finally  the New York Times reported that Mr  Gonzales excluded important Administration personnel from deliberations on the Administration s plan to establish military tribunals at Guantanamo  a plan that was widely criticized as unjust  unworkable  and unconstitutional  Secretary of State Powell  National Security Advisor Rice  and the head of the Justice Department s Criminal Division  Michael Chertoff  saw the President s Military Order only after it was published in November 2001  Most of the Pentagon s top military lawyers were also kept in the dark  More than three years after the Order s publication  not a single detainee at Guantanamo has been successfully prosecuted  To the contrary  as predicted by officials who have expertise in the field  the military tribunal process there is falling apart                 Torture has never before been a Republican versus Democrat issue  Instead  it s always been an issue of broad consensus and ideals  reflecting the fundamental values of the nation  President Reagan signed the Convention Against Torture in 1988  President George H W  Bush and President Clinton supported its ratification in 1994  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  led by Senator Helms and Senator Pell  voted 10 0 to report the Convention favorably to the full Senate     I hope that this tradition of bipartisanship and consensus will continue today  I hope that all members of the Senate will cast their vote in a way that upholds our fundamental values    A no vote is the right vote if we care about maintaining America s standing in the world and fighting the war on terrorism  The torture and other abuses of prisoners in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo have done immense damage to America s standing in the world  The extreme and irresponsible claims in the Bybee and Goldsmith Memorandums have raised basic questions about the genuineness of our commitment to the rule of law    It is the right vote for our troops  The Administration s shameful disregard for our laws and treaties on torture has lowered the bar for the protection of our own soldiers  It has violated the military s longstanding golden rule  treat captured combatants in the manner we expect our own soldiers to be treated  What can Mr  Gonzales possibly say to a country that justifies its torture of a U S  soldier by citing Mr  Gonzales s own record of support for it    A no vote is the only vote that is consistent with the fundamental values on which this nation is founded  justice  accountability  and respect for individual dignity    The continuing effort to blame the torture scandal on a few bad apples among our soldiers while rewarding Mr  Gonzales with promotion to Attorney General is a despicable signal for America to send the world  We should not support a nominee who has done so much to harm America s basic interests and fundamental values  I urge my colleagues to reject this nomination      Laura Capps  Melissa Wagoner   202  224 2633

FRIST COMMENTS ON ELECTIONS TO U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) today made the following statement on the United Nations General Assembly's election of members to the newly created Human Rights Council:  
   ""Yesterday, China, Cuba and other countries with poor human rights records were elected by the UN General Assembly to the newly created Human Rights Council. This demonstrates the Council's failure to address the significant shortcomings of the widely discredited UN Commission on Human Rights. Freedom House has given these countries and others now on the Council a rating of 'not free,' and I find it troubling that some of the world's worst human rights abusers were able to obtain a seat on this body. 
   ""As I and many of my Senate colleagues have argued, the new Council makes only superficial changes to the former commission structure. The new Council cannot be taken seriously as a protector of human rights around the world when a number of its members have a long track record of egregious human rights abuses. As such, we cannot rely upon it to monitor human rights abuses throughout the world. 
   ""Today, I renew my call for the United States to establish a group of like-minded democracies with a demonstrated commitment to the protection of human rights in order to create an effective and accountable human rights oversight body outside the UN system. Even though the UN refuses to make real and substantive reforms, the United States must continue its principled leadership and its commitment to the protection of human rights. 
   ""In addition, the General Assembly's recent vote against UN reform efforts demonstrates that many member states are not serious about meaningful reform of the UN. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to renew their calls for a wide-scale overhaul of the UN. As it stands, the organization is fraught with corruption, inefficiency and waste. In order to restore its international credibility, the UN needs to change.""

FRIST APPLAUDS NOMINATION OF ALBERTO GONZALEZ AS ATTORNEY GENERAL
  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D. (R-TN) today made the following statement on President Bush's nomination of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez as Attorney General:  
   ""I applaud President Bush for nominating White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez as Attorney General. He has lived the American Dream - from humble roots as the son of migrant workers who never finished elementary school to be nominated by the President of the United States as the first Hispanic American Attorney General. He is also a skilled lawyer who will continue to lead the fight on the war on terror and help make America safer and more secure. I look forward to swift action on his nomination by the Senate in the 109th Congress.""
